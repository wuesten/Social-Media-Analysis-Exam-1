3,OVerall a great place to have German dinner. The restaurant is very small and intimate and you must make a reservation. Everything we tried was great. Check it out!
3,"Really like this place - nice coffee, alternative folks, loungy music.Need a location to celebrate? You can even rent the Bacana for private parties, the owner is definitely a laid back dude. Just be sure you organize a few things yourself, if you need a DJ or anything ;)The Bacana is nice for breakfast and coffee during day, but also a cosy location to hang out later. Contra (to me): sometimes the guys smoke, which you can smell the next day while wanting to have breakfast"
3,"We stumbled upon this place on a Sunday during a recent trip to Hamburg.   It appears to be family owned and a very friendly restaurant as well.   We had several interesting dishes fresh fish, potatoes soup and my daughter's favorite a sort of perogi casserole.   We have had to recreate this and it has become a family favorite.   Nice view on the canal too."
3,"Very good! Can't believe it took me 5 years to try the place. Now I know why it was always so busy.My only negative is that the portions aren't consistent, I've noticed some customers getting preferential treatment with much more toppings, and this made me sad. Why do you hate me, Kumpir König!?"
3,"Concept of this place is great and design too.It made like real apartment, if a real apartment was with table football,bar and filled with sofas:D +they have literature and live music evenings every first and third wednesday.-Not so special drink menu.Also once my glass of wine was filled from 3 bottle leftoversphe:( Thats why only 4 stars.Otherwise this place is great."
4,Wow. Simply delicious food & really excellent service. I was a single diner here during a business trip in Hamburg and will make a special effort to return every time I'm in Hamburg!
4,"Since I'm an Asian, I dare to say this Japances Restaurant is very very traditional and their cooking is fantastic. Even they have Teppanyaki, there is not much in Hamburg. I'm sure I will try it next time."
4,"Great place to have dinner eating typical food of hamburg: fish!Nice interior, great and nice service, beer and wine, quick service.For us this evening was the last of a few days in hamburg; a real great finish!"
2,"If u r searching for a good cocktail bar, it's what u r looking for. Awesome atmosphere and nice drinks! But the food isn't so tasty. Good thing is they offer gluten free meals! I'll say better to go there as a bar rather than restaurant."
3,"Yummy food, good service and a cozy atmosphere-- Das Dorf serves up a very nice German dining experience. Before our trip to Hamburg, we made a reservation at Das Dorf for a Saturday evening. We arrived for our reservation and was seated right away. The place doesn't look very big at first, but they definitely take advantage of every single corner available. The atmosphere is cosy albeit you're cramped into a cellar.I had the stewed ox cheeks and my husband had the schnitzel. The ox cheeks were very flavorful and the schnitzel was good. The portions were generous and the service was nice and fast. I would recommend Das Dorf for a nice dinner in Hamburg."
0,"Been there once due to the many recommendations and was really dissappointed. Bad service: slow, uncoordinated, sloppyFood was average at its best I have to admit that we were a crowd of 12 people which is always a little tricky for the chef - but we ordered a table in advance - therefore it should not have been a surprise. Overall: Not worth the trip to Wandsbek at all."
4,"I always come to this place when i get visitors in town.First of all, its the first pub/bar on the way to the schulterblatt. second of all I love the aquarium. don't ask me why? i just do. FYI, if you've never been there, there's an ""aquarium"" in the middle of the pub. Don't mistake it for a table. A couple of my visiting (girl)friends thought it was a table and 'pouf' put their bags into the water. Luckily no irreparable damages. Anyway beside this warning (and anecdote) do go there!Its nice, its fun, its packed, and its not too expensive!Happy hour till 22.00!"
2,"The Parlament is hidden in the Rathaus basement?; the reason why I probably have never seen it before.Inside the interior is really majestic and richly ornated. The crowd is a bit older, up against 40.The atmosphere is quite formal, but fits fine with the venue. The food seems to be expensive, but I havent tried it yet. Nice to take your parents, or just enjoy a typically businesslike/historical spot in Hamburg. Tourist or not."
4,"Startlingly good French food, right in the center of Hamburg.  Stopped in here a few weeks back with some coworkers, and quickly settled on the Menu (prix fix).  The appetizer was an easy choice --- the house-made pâtés (""Duo von hausgemachter Pastete"") included both a rough-ground one and a chunkier country-style version.I was thrilled with my chicken special --- rich, savory, and completely unlike your average American chicken dish.  Excellent potatoes rounded out the skillet of deliciousness.  One of my companions was underwhelmed by the rockfish (""Steinbeißer"") catch of the day.Dessert was again an easy choice; the ""Crêpe ""normande"" mit Calvados"" (apple crêpe with apple brandy) was delicious, if twice the size I needed.Wine choice was as extensive as you'd expect from a good French place, with a reasonable by-the-glass selection.Definitely a must-try for a nice meal out in Hamburg.  The waiter was comfortable in German and French, but less so in English."
4,"Bock Treffpunkt Imbiss has been described to be as ""the place where vegetarians eat meat, where non-smokers smoke and where atheists come to pray.""It's that good. I ordered the köttbullar and the dish managed to exceed my already high expectations. I thought the sauteed mushrooms in the sauce was a nice touch as well. It really brought together all of the flavours. Post meal, we were offered a choice of dessert. I went with the chocolate pudding and custard. This was hands down the best köttbullar that I've had in Hamburg, yet.It's quite the interesting little setup as well -- underneath a tent. Very cozy and not the least bit cold in Winter as it is heated."
2,"So yes, the coffee here is quite good (although I would say that it still is a bit short of 'excellent'), and yes, their cakes and bagels are very good. However, I would still not easily recommend going here, mainly because of service issues. First of all we had to wait quite a while before finally being served, while our waitress was chatting away with a friend and other wait staff studiously avoided us - and we only got served after we walked over to her and asked her to take our order, after which either she or the kitchen managed to get us the wrong bagel. Furthermore, it's crowded and noisy and you will be hard pressed to find a comfortable place. All in all, the quality of the food and coffee is severely let down by the service and ambiance."
3,"If you're looking for something a little more upscale that won't break the bank, this is definitely a great spot to go. Was here for a company outing dinner and really enjoyed it. The menu is quite diverse and they have an excellent selection of Flammkuechen, fish dishes and burgers. There's definitely something on the menu for everyone. I had the ""Fisch Platte"" that was a whitefish, salmon and shrimp scampi (unfortuately cold) -- came with Bratkartoffeln and a small salad. Huge portion but all of it very tasty. A colleague got a burger and he also enjoyed this. It's an old warehouse type space renovated with a large dining hall and smaller rooms off to the sides, seems like a great place for a group to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. To top it off, there is a real ""Trude"" in the back lawn! Massive!"
1,"This is a really great bar if you enjoy being deafened by an Elvis impersonator so much that you can't even order your beer because no one can hear you. Oh and you're blinded by strobe lights. And surrounded by a mix of drunk college kids and older people who are still college at heart. Otherwise, I think you'll find the ambiance stressful, the beer so so, and the time worth spending somewhere else."
4,SO FUN. Learned a lot! Would definitely do it again.
4,"Ham-Burgers in Hamburg Germany yes please! Especially if it here. This place has burger flavors to try more than once. Lunch time was a bit busy but rightfully so for good food.i chose the baked potato instead of fries and I'm glad I did. If anything I would just go for that and a burger on the side.  While I'm not a salad eater they do make them fresh right in front of you and the portion is large. And as delicious as they looked I would even eat one. Who doesn't want burgers and beer. Well you can get both here, enjoy a table outside and people watch as they pass in a hurry to get to their next destination.  My husband upgraded his champion burger and it was far better than my own. They also offer no bun options and a blue cheese burger that I heard was really good too.  What seems to be a chain restaurant or fast food was not like anything I'm use to in the US.  I would definitely go back. The cashiers were friendly and informative and offered a smile with every meal purchase. But don't expect fast food service if they are busy everything is made to order. But for me that is worth the wait."
4,"Excellent rib eye steak!!! One of the best steaks I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. Being from Texas, and having grown up on a ranch, eating steaks my whole life, you will not be disappointed here. The service is a little slow, order more beer to take up the extra time!! The cheesecake is excellent, not as good as Don't Tell Mama's, here in Hamburg, but well worth eating. Busy restaurant, never had trouble getting a table. A little better than Estancia Steak House because of price , and the cheesecake."
4,This is probably the best place for tasty food and amazing cakes in the world! You really need to try the hot cocoa!
2,"This place was weird. But then againanything is weird after drinking 1.5 bottles of wine before going out with your friends. Was there on a Saturday night and it was completely crowded and kind of sweaty. Someone grabbed my butt a couple of times, one other guy tried to put my coat on his girlfriend he was so wasted and in the backgroundGod awful euro-trance-house-crap that was pretty relentless. This was the upstairs. Moving onto the downstairsta da! We are now in the mid-30's zone complete with German style rap/grind/singalong antics. I don't know about you, but watching Berta and Hans get it on in their tight Euro jeans does something sad to your soul. Oh yes, another Pilsner bitte."
4,Pretty cool  spot for having cocktails  and wine  with a lot of people. Seems to be a place to be for a night out !
4,"Skyline 20up Bar is located at the 20th level of the Empire Riverside Hotel. A lot of tables were already booked when we arrived and the inside is quite small, so I advise you to come early or book your own. The bar offers you a great view on Sankt Pauli, Altona and Harburg. Their cocktails are amazing and not like the usual ones, there is a good research on the texture, colour and presentation."
3,"This place is very popular. Been here twice in the evenings and had to wait between 5-10 minutes for a table. And with good reason, the food is really good. The service is super quick, given all the people inside and those queueing combined with 2 waitresses.The menu is quite small though, ask for the English menu if you require it. Your choices are mainly between pho and rice vermicelli noodles with some meat. Very delicious food though. Top it off with beer Saigon or beer Ha. It should cost under 10 euros for your meal and a beer."
4,"Fancy hipster coffee shops exist outside of San Francisco, go figure. Admittedly SF probably just copied places like this one.Elbold Röstkaffee has all the marks of a hipster coffee place: 1) Crowded with people sitting around, drinking coffee, and not on laptops2) More real estate dedicated to bean roasting equipment than restaurant space3) Visible bean roasting equipment4) Handwritten labelingDelightful chocolate candy treat served with the coffee, yum!, and a great place to spend the afternoon catching up with friends."
3,Nice place to eat a burger in the center of Hamburg. It was quite busy but my order didn't take very long to prepare. Decent prices. Will visit again!
4,"Super great food, great atmosphere, friendly people, city center location. And really cheap prices for excellent food. My favorite place in Hamburg."
4,"This venue is really cool. I've been there three times and I always listened to some good music. The place is unbelievably small, the smallest venue I've ever been to, and the first time I was there I wondered how they could do gigs in there. But the atmosphere there is great and people is there to listen to music. If you want to discover and listen to some underground, mostly German, artists that you've probably never heard of that is definitely the best spot in Hamburg I know so far."
4,Delicious duck. Big quantity in the dishes. I will come back when I will be back in Hamburg
2,"I was curious because I saw these places all over Hamburg and I love Asian fusion! I have to wait 30 minutes to get my food. Also, I probably have a different working definition of what Asian fusion is...I ordered a vegetarian curry.... It said it came with tofu, but I couldnt really find any on the plate. Plus for an ""imbiss"" this place took forever. But I have to admit, the vegetables were fresh and I liked how they had sauces out on the table. I ordered spicy and although it wasn't spicy enough, I could pile on as much Siracha and chilis as I wanted. (People started to stare.) Everything here is gluten free so I guess that is great if you have food allergies. But really, the majority of asian food just tends to be gluten free in general. No surprise there. This place seemed pretty popular. It was hard to find a seat and I don't really know why. They have locations all over the city and are open late, so it is pretty convenient. Foodwise, it is just like any other semi-palatable Asian place."
4,"This place is AMAZING! I lived in Hamburg for 3 months, and loved this place. The Durum Doner they make is made fresh all day. Juicy meat and amazing Tortilla like bread..... You will not regret going here, trust me!!"
4,"Wonderful meal. Incredible service. Charming ambiance even the clientele looked hand picked for this place. Family nights out, fancy dinner dates, groups of friends catching up over a long French dinner. All represented tonight. I had the snails to start. (They are not in shells. They come in a hot pot pre stewed) it's was wonderful if a tad salty. Scampi provencal for the main was perfect. I wiped the sauce with extra bread. And the standout of the evening for me, the desert (who would have thought it, not I) the apple pancake soaked in a very lightly sweet liquor and Caramelized sugar on top. Not sure what wine I was served but it was great too."
4,Very great cafe. Its such a nice crew there. It's the place to go. Food an drinks are cheap and great at the same time.
4,"This restaurant was a great and random find. The food was tasty and the service friendly; OK, so my borther and I were the only customers in there, but as we were looking for something good open a little late, this was amazing !!! Highly recommended !!!"
4,"This is place is really good, delicious food, good ambiance, good prices. You have to try the crepe flambé, I want to go back soon."
3,"They were super busy when we arrived but managed to give us a table. We ordered quickly and the food came out surprisingly fast as well! I had the salmon, it's was so tasty! Definitely going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
3,"This is a great place. When I see Döner queen, I feel like to hang out there with friends. Foods are cheap and good quality."
3,"Burgerlich is a Burger Restaurant close to Rathaus. When you enter the Restaurant you get a card, which you need to order your food. Within the tables there are tablet which you have to use to order your food. Be aware that you order everything seperately. The food is the served at the table. Before you leave the restaurant you pay at the exit."
4,"As a non-smoker I only ever visit Duske & Duske to get my fix of English-language magazines, but their selection is surprisingly large (for automotive titles, that is) and the service is impeccable, in an understated, Hanseatic fashion. I think it's also much more charming than getting the mags at the train station anyway. Once I bought some cigars as a present for a friend, who told me they were top notch quality - they better be, for Duske & Duske's range isn't exactly cheap, but the helpful and competent assistance was a great bonus, particularly as I had no clue what I should buy."
4,The best pizza in St. Pauli is clearly made by Pauli Pizza.At this tiny little spot near Reeperbahn you can create your own pizza by choosing your fave ingredients off the menu. Distinguish between sizes small and normal.Thankfully everyone even on a budget will get fed there for little money. The prices are low and the pizzas are great all the same. Whatta treat!The chatty staff are funny guys very willing to help you out if you don't know what else to top up the base with. I recommend this down-to-earth place at any hour of the day :)
4,After sitting here a full sunday afternoon recovering from the night before this place really showed its merits. The music was perfect sunday chill music and the choise between strong and normal apple cider was a true blessing.
4,"Do you like cars? Of course you like cars! You HAVE to see this place! The gorgeous, show-room style exhibition place is fantastic and features cards from a multitude of decades, including video installations, toy/marketing products on show and a porsche simulator! Yes, you get to sit in a Porsche and drive it around the Nueremburgring. How fantastic is that!Definitely a must for every car lover and even those with just a mild interest, it's just so beautiful and well presented.Do not miss the second, temporary exhibit downstairs! It's in a separate space, so it's easy to miss. As it's a changing exhibit, I can't say what they'll be showing off when you get to go, but it's always intersting and really well done. So be sure to check it out."
3,Cafe Mexico is a nice little Mexican restaurant just to the north of the Schanze. I had the chilli con carne burrito and was quite surprised when something that I would have recognised as enchiladas was presented to me. Definitely different to the Americanised burrito places that are starting to pop-up around Hamburg. If you like tequila then (I assume) this is definitely a place to visit seeing as they have about 100 different types A nice touch is the complementary shot of tequila before you leave.
4,"It is a hidden gem. One of the best restaurant in Hamburg. Very high quality food with a creative touch, yet affordable. Prepair to wait for at least 30 min. to get a table."
4,"We found La Trattoria on Yelp, and decided to drive over for a Saturday lunch outing. It was a rainy summer day, but the restaurant was open to the air, and an awning covered a few tables that were outside on the sidewalk.La Trattoria has a fairly standard bound Italian restaurant menu (antipasti, pastas, pizzas), then they have a chalkboard of what must be seasonal specials (or just recommendations) for lunch, and then there's a second chalkboard of daily specials. The waiter (who seemed like he must also be the manager) was friendly and got us a seat right away, tried a few jokes with our daughter, and was patient explaining the options.My wife had the cheese-filled ravioli with truffle cream sauce, which was excellent. There were seven or eight good-sized ravioli filled with some kind of firm-ish cheese, and covered in a very decadent truffle cream sauce. I ordered the daily special of chanterelles in a cream sauce over homemade papardelle; it was incredibly good. Lots of mushrooms, good portion size, and tons of flavor in every bite. Being six, our daughter ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce, and managed to eat about half of the giant ""kids"" portion (which she finished with gusto at home the next day).We also ordered tiramisu and tartufo for dessert. The tartufo was just okay, but the tiramisu was quite good. Overall, we loved our experience here, and will definitely be back."
4,"I am always a little nervous about engaging with vegetarian food, but this has definitely altered my perspective. Delicious falafel dishes and good beer options make this the perfect place to settle into for an early evening meal. The food came really quickly, was well priced and the atmosphere in here is very relaxed. Although I haven't yet sampled the pleasures of the takeaway, I was glad to see they do this. Living locally, I will definitely be taking advantage of the takeaway dishes on offer."
3,Great atmosphere. Fresh food. Good service. Bustling. Reservations recommended but helpful to get seated if not. Smaller menu selection. Menu changed weekly.
4,"I am so happy finding this place through windy day of Hamburg. Despite of its small space and no chair, their food is super satisfying. That day, they only sold two choices of dishes: spaghetti (€7) and lasagna (€12). I ordered spaghetti topped with sorta white fish and tomato sauce. It came with big portion for my late lunch. The fish topping was generous and its sauce is pretty good, not too sour. You can choose some of beverages served. I ordered ingwer-minze-tee because I need hot beverage to reduce the windy effect to my body. I think I chose the right drink because it really boosted my mood. Thanks!!"
0,"A place that calls it self CHICAGO MEATPACKER and just offers 3 american beers (and 3 standard beers at that) seems like a rip off wrapped up in an US theme to me.Haven't had food there, because the beer experience was enough already."
1,"Meh. If you're single and looking to mingle on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, Sausalitos might be a good place to start. Their drink menu is pretty impressive, but I found the Mexican food subpar. Not worth the money, in my opinion. On the weekends it feels much more like a club than a restaurant. I'd go again with friends for drinks, but I won't be paying for a meal again."
4,"I was in a rush and wanted to grab a quick takeaway for the train. The staff here was professional and helpful (in both English and German), and my Pho was done in 5 minutes! Everything nicely packed, very tasty, and proportion was perfect for the containers. Can't wait to eat in next time!"
3,"Cute place for a brunch in summer.Outdoor seatings however arent the most comfortable. The crowd is made of families, groups of friends, couples, business meetings. The brunch buffet doesn't offer a very wide choice, however it has the basics: cheese, salami, bread, eggs, müsli .."
3,"I was rather impressed with the bartender at this place. He was incredibly fast while giving each drink great attention and care. The waitresses working the tiny floor are also super-attentive and friendly, which is totally unexpected for a bar (or maybe I'm just overly accustomed to the I'm-too-hipster-for-you attitude of SF bars).Drinks were really good and reasonably priced. I'm not sure I agree with the current €€€ price attribute for this place. Having gone to IMARA across the street before coming here, drinks were way better priced at The Boilerman.Space is pretty tight. I imagine it's a bit better in the summer when they can make use of their front outdoor area. If you're standing in front of the bar, you'll have a constant flow of traffic from people going to the restroom. On the other hand, watching the bartender work is kind of mesmerizing.Smoking is allowed inside, so you'll walk out smelling like you slept in a tobacco factory. You may also shave off 5 years of your life. I'm hoping that eventually changes but people do love smoking here.On a Saturday night, it was packed and pretty loud. You'll definitely need to shout to be heard by anyone other than the person right next to you. Music isn't too loud, though, so that's a plus.Drink menu we got was entirely in English, which is a bit odd since a native German asked for them. The place was heavy on English speakers though, so they may just default to English menus when that happens.If you're in the area, definitely worth checking out."
4,"I agree with Andrew, A meat eaters paradise. I'm surprised to read that no one has reviewed the peppercorn steak special, this steak at a low price of 13.95, come with a salad, green beans and baked potato as well. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! the steak was great, their housemade sour cream made the potato. The salad arrived shortly after our beers. Our server was so kind, always smiling and he read my mind when i was craving more sourcream."
2,"A typical ice cream shop with a pretty large selection of your basic and expected flavors. It was good, but with so much competition in the area (Eishunger, Cellos...), this would probably be my last pick on Mühlenkamp to get a scoop in the future. If they had more interesting flavors or more attractive prices, then I'd come back!"
1,"Kofookoo is very spacious and nicely decorated. I liked the high ceiling and the interesting light fixtures. The menu is all you can eat or you can order al a carte. Just so we can try more dishes, we went for the all you can eat. We came at lunch on a weekend so it was 15.90 per person--honestly rather steep for the quality of food. I had a hankering for sushi so we ordered most of the sushi, especially those with the raw fish. The only decent thing was the sake (salmon). The octopus and squid were super chewy and had no flavor. The tuna maki was a little concerning because the rice around the fish had turned pink. That shouldn't happen unless the fish was dyed, or something. Also all the maki tasted like they was pre-made and left out for awhile. We tried the warm dishes and the tofu was the most tasty so we ordered a second one, but it was cut too thick so the center was not warm at all. The best part about the food was the black sesame ice cream; we ordered two portions and ate it with the fried kokos creme and fried banana. We got the fruit salad and it was melon that had obviously been cut and sitting there for some time.The staff was nice and friendly and the service was good and quick. However, I wouldn't come back."
3,"The place is quite small but beautifully situated and it is serving good fish dishes. The service is very helpful and nice. The owner is a nice and chatty guy. Unfortunately there's no toilet and one must use one in ice cream spot next to it, which is kinda awkward. One must also know that there are few places to sit. Nevertheless place worth visiting."
4,"A M A Z I N G!Other reviewers have all said it. What I can add is that the world now seems way too big... Details, sense of humor and the massive scale of this miniature world can't be missed. Two hours wasn't enough. Go on a weekday and stay for 3+ hours. Make sure you stand at each station long enough for the daylight / nighttime transitions to occur."
4,"Found this restaurant through Yelp. The reviews convinced us to try it and  I'm glad we did.  This very small (24-30) seat restaurant serves authentic German cuisine.  The menu was hand written in German so my wife and I couldn't read a thing.  The waiter, who spoke limited English, slowly interpreted everything on the menu for us.I had wild boar, cooked osso buco style. Served with a creamy risotto.  It was outstanding.  My wife had Weiner Schnitzel which was excellent. We had oysters and calamari for apps. 2 glasses of regional wines.  Bill was €72.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant"
2,A regular Starbucks place with nice and interesting interior and a truly nice views of the lake
3,"Friendly staff, knowing what they're talking about.Could be a bit more into having a conversations its you, but hey, we're in Hamburg after all, not California or Portland, Oregon.Speaking off:I wish there would be some more exotic brews but then again this is an English (Irish?) pub, so:all goodGood brews, friendly staff - you won't be annoyed getting wasted here."
4,"Fantastic food, friendly staff who always remember a face, and reasonable prices (mid-range but for good portion sizes)! Bin begeistert!!"
4,Great small and cozy place. Love the food and the service. Very nice couple. Details show they care.
3,"Like usual, super Burger and tasty Cocktails.Insiders will always go the roof, great Lounge feelingand super View to the Elbe River.(Good Weather Only)Side Area of the Roof is Rain- and Wind protected.Don't miss it for a Tour through Hamburg."
2,Good cocktails. good food. happy hour. service could be better.
4,"Went there with my boyfriend for our first night in Hamburg! Both of us started with a soup and then we had the seitan-Gyros plate which was delicious! The waiter was really nice too! For two soups, two gyros and a bottle of water we paid 53€, which is a bit on the pricier side but I would still highly recommend it!"
3,"Came here last night as we were showing some visiting family the Hafen City area and some great views of the harbour area.I have walked past a few times but not tried it here. So we tried it!All in all, a very nice Thai food experience. Nice and polite service in English and/or German, no fuss when we asked for simple non-spicy food (chicken noodle stir fry) for the children and then on opting for the 3 smaller set tasting menus (one each of A, B & C) for EUR33 got a wonderful mix of truly delicious authentic food.Only downside was the cost, but I guess in this part of town ( yuppie flats, business expense lunches and cruise ship tourists) it is what it is plus the food really is very good here.So for 3 set meals, 2 childrens meals, 5 drinks + service = not much change from EUR200 !!So all in all, very nice for a special family treat (but just not that often)"
4,"This delicious Turkish lunch spot has to be one of my favorite, if not my favorite lunches in Hamburg. During the lunch hour (12:30 ownward) the line goes far out the door, so I recommend going early. From there, get your favorite kebab fillings. Other notables are the hot food bar and unlimited bread you can get while waiting in line.The all-German, very lengthy menu is a little tricky, but the good news is everything is delicious so you really can't go wrong.Cash only, so definitely don't show up waving your Visa around."
4,"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday...delicious eggs with Krabben (little shrimp from the North Sea), good croissants and brötchen, top notch butter and marmalade, good coffee, excellent service. Sweet little place with tables outside, but not too many."
4,"This is my new favorite burger place in Hamburg. It has claimed the number one spot over two other great burger places. Their burgers are a nice size, but don't leave you feeling bloated when you finish. Their fries are perfectly cooked. Their beverages are also great. The service staff is attentive and very quick. All in all I would say this place is a must go. If you love burgers and either love in Hamburg or are planning to visit Hamburg, this is the place for you. We've been here a couple of times, and this place is yet to disappoint. The Mr. T burger isy personal favorite choice. Can't go wrong with that."
3,"Whether or not 20up is your kind of scene it's worth it to come and check out the view at least once while you're in Hamburg. Floor to ceiling windows give a breathtaking view of the Hamburg harbor. When we came it was really crowded and we had to hover to get a table, but once we sat down it was really nice. The drinks here are strong and pricey, about 9-16 euros per drink.  The dress code is business casual and the crowd is a bit more on the mature side. I would put this on the beginning of your itinerary to grab a drink and tick off your list, then walk over to the bars to fill up the rest of your drinking tank. :)"
2,"Surprise to find this place. Food are not bad,  but not surprisingly good anyway. Very friend staff, we really enjoyed it. We like the duck and dim sum which are very good. The beef rice noodle are so so, could be worse. The owner seems well connected so he has many pictures with famous politicians."
4,"I've had the Miniatur Wunderland as a bookmark for close to ten years. I made the specific trip to Hamburg to visit it today. And it was totally worth it. Absolutely incredible, it exceeded my expectations.Picture a table-top miniature train set. Now expand it to the size of a warehouse. On two floors. And add hundreds of trains, thousands of vehicles, millions of little people. Everywhere you look, there's some interesting little detail. I spotted a dozen monks working on repairing the Popemobile. A guy operating a jackhammer that would bounce around. Two people hiding on a roof that were fighting.The cars stop at lights. They even have their turn signals blinking before the light turns green and they head off on whatever mission they're programmed for.The airport? Absolutely beyond anything you can imagine. The planes take off and land. They taxi up to gates. The mini jetbridge pops out! The ground crew vehicles all follow the proper procedures for driving around the airport. They even have a fire brigade that leaves the firehouse to follow inbound trains.Tips: Get there as early as you can because it does get crowded. Make sure your phone is charged as you're going to want to take a million pictures and a ton of video. They do have a free wifi.This was one of the highlights of my week-long trip to Europe.[Review 12057 overall, 1840 of 2019.]"
4,"My husband and I had such an amazing meal here a few nights ago. We are big fans of Lebanese food and this place took the cuisine to a totally new place for us. The staff was friendly and nice as could be...so very welcoming! And the food!!!! Best falafel ever! Delicous assortment of mezze, each one looked and tasted so yummy. My eggplant main was the dish of my dreams and my husband had the duck with fig carpaccio and loved all of the different flavors, especially the cinnamon rice with roasted cashews on the side. Were the shotglasses filled with chilled anise flavoured liquor terrific? Yes indeed! Was the mint sorbet and the panna cotta the best way to end a fantastic meal? Absolutely!"
3,"A lovely place to spend a summer's day. Swim, sunbathe, take a boat trip, visit the planetarium or sit in Schumacher's beer garden. Also a concert venue. nice for outdoor concerts although they have to finish by 10pm."
3,Amazing views of the Alster while sitting down on a fun lounge chair. They even provide you with blankets so it feels nice and cozy like you are at home. The view is fantastic! They have a nice drink selection but not sure how the food is! I would recommend this place for drinks and just hanging out.
1,"Update: I'm going to have to mark Jim Burritos down a bit because they keep on disappointing. The food is generally still pretty good, although my last burrito was burnt from being left in the toaster far too long. I feel bad saying bad things about the place, but I think one member of staff in particular is rather dozy. She seems to have no idea who ordered what first. If she's on, you can walk in and order your food and then watch as streams of people who came in much later get their food first. Then when your food finally arrives (I have waited 90 minutes) you could very well be given the wrong order. I took two friends last week. We were the only people without food when we ordered, so I expected the three burritos to come quite fast, say in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, after watching plenty of other tables receive their food, we finally got ours. Mine was burnt. My friend was given a spicy one, when she'd ordered non-spicy. After a small complaint she was offered some extra sour cream. Instead of bringing it over, the staff went outside for a cigarette break. The sour cream never came and when we went to pay they had the nerve to overcharge us! Sigh. I still like Jim Burritos, and will continue to go, but I won't take visitors anymore, and I certainly will never go back on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday - they are just too slow.Old review: Pretty damn good burrito shop where the old Hatari cantina used to reside. We popped into Jim Burrito's last night - you've gotta try the new places, right? I got a beef burrito with guacamole for EUR6.50 (EUR5.50 without the guacamole). Their burritos come wrapped in tin foil, and so can be a bit of a pain to eat - I'd rather be given the option to have it straight onto a plate without all the foil. Anyway, the burrito was great."
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90. Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel. Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
2,The 'Erste Liebe Bar' is a well designed modern coffee place in a great location. Away from traffic and noise. The interior is clean and modern with large bar and friendly staff. The breakfast menu is not huge but they have brilliant coffee and fresh juices. All in all a nice place with a pleasant atmosphere.
0,"As group of 3, made is wait about an hour for course number 2. Reacted very unfriendly and harsh when called out. Food is good though..."
4,Great location! I was there for the first time and the coffee is very delicious! Nice staff!
4,"When the sun is shining, this is the place to be! The associates are fun and relaxed but still focus on service and remain spontaneous.It is a little bit high prices... though sometimes life is to enjoy it!!!"
3,"Reliable old standby for me in Hamburg, as I find myself there at least once a year.  Excellent menu, nicely prepared & presented.  In St. Georg, which has a Villagey, Bleecker/Christopher feel. Decor & atmosphere remind me a bit of Odeon back home in NY."
4,I was there by accident. A friend was just showing me around in his neighbourhood. We were having a cheap but excellent coffee there. .....Mister Lars Herden was just roasting some coffee beans and started to explain the manufacturing process to us...He took quite some time to make us understand the difference between normal industrial coffee and his excellent product...I will definitely come back. Love this authentic wonderful place ;)
4,"As the rest of the reviewer have already pointed out, Speicherstadt is simply a must see when visiting Hamburg. And now when Hafen City with its contemporary architecture is being developed and parts already finished, the neighbouring Speicherstadt makes a beautiful contrast with its red brick facades and green copper roofs. In 2003 Speicherstadt was removed from the Free Port and since then it also houses museums, cafés, shops and offices along with stocking tea, spices, coffe, persian rugs and the rest of the warehouse goods it is famour for."
3,"Nice location, stick to details and definitely worth to visit. I think the entrance is all little bit high, but at he end of the day, u should visit it, when u are in Hamburg"
4,"You like tabletop gaming and mead? This is the place for you!A wonderful little basement bar that's full of cliches and atmosphere. From the medieval style kitsch decor to the barrells full of games (literally! the barrells have latched doors and when you open them, boom, plethora of tabletop games inside) this is a theme bar not to be missed!Bring a few friends, grab a table and a board game and enjoy a mead or two. Or come on your own and make new friends! Several of their games have English versions as well and they have Wasabi, which is a quick dice game with instructions in fifteen or so languages. It does get quite crowded on weekends and evenings, but go and have a look anyway, you might be lucky and grab a nice spot. Definitely one of my faves in the city."
3,"Thanks to the fab coffee connoisseurs of Yelp Hamburg--danke Euch nochmal!--, I received some great tips on where to go for my third-wave crave while staying in Hamburg.Public, located in Neustadt, was not too terribly far from our digs near the Hauptbahnhof.  We either took a mildly long walk to Public or a short U-Bahn ride; it was that easy.What initially struck me about Public was its atmosphere.  Relaxed and inviting comes to mind when I think of the set-up.  Public is a cosy yet hip spot with wooden tables and chairs, fresh flowers & wee potted cacti, and soft lighting.  Order at the counter, pay straight away or not, then take a seat.  It's just that easy.  If you've questions about the beans, the type of coffee drink you might wish to try, then do avail yourselves of the worker-owners.  They're putting a lot of 'herzblut' into keeping Public stellar and it shows.  Want to further your java knowledge?  Well, start by checking out the detailed 'coffee map' up on the wall to the right of the counter. -facts and figures galore!On one of my many visits, I spoke to a young man who, upon my telling him where I was from, seemed really receptive to my coffee queries.  Between making drinks he'd pop back 'round to my perch at the window and continue the coffee-chat.  I really enjoyed the interaction.  Chit-chat aside, the bevvies are top-notch.  The pastries are lovely, too.  Visitors and locals alike: a trip to Public is in order!Remember: WWJB?"
3,"Bulgogi burger with extra cheddar, twisted fries and pineapple mint shake. Delicious, kind service although the home made fries my kids had were a bit flaccid. Lychee limo was to die for according to my 16 year old! Would definitely come back and try the other special burgers!"
2,"- 20EUR all you can eat (I think that is all they do really) is actually fairly priced in my opinion.- yes agree with some of the reviews here, better sushi can be found elsewhere, however it's a 3 star for me still as the quality is good enough, and service is friendly- yes, cosy place but always have room for baby pushchair in the corner and staff is always friendly and helpful"
4,"Just yummy!Opening times are a bit unusual, and you have to get there early to get a table and/or a certain dish because they only prepare a certain amount of any given dish. They do deliver a few chosen dishes and these are really good!"
0,"They put the chairs upside down in our table while there were 15 min to closing. A good product will not sell if you don't know how to behave , sorry Jim Borrito"
3,Excellent fresh food and impeccable service. Great place for a date. Gnocchi melted in my mouth and small salad looked and tasted great.
4,"it's sad that other people have had not the best experiences here. i can tell you though that it can't be because of the taste or quality of the food, because it's superb. Been there three times and it's some of the best currywurst you can find anywhere. I've tried both the vegan and traditional bio. both were equally good. also the fries are perfect and they don't charge extra for unlimited condiments (which makes sense because the food is slightly pricey)definitely worth it"
4,"The best bar on Hamburger Berg- Rosis is similar to many of the other ""dive"" bars aufm Kiez but it has a special something going on for it which seperates it from the rest of the bars around here. Is is the drinks? Nah, an Astra here costs pretty much the same in every bar near the Reeperbahn. Just dont get caught drinking any other beer. Could it be the atmosphere? Maybe- the wood interior with paintings and lamps straight out of the 60s and 70s certainly lend this place some character. The foosball table and couch also add nice distractions when you dont want to dance. Oh, now that I mention it, its the dancing! People here just want to dance, dance, dance. The DJ on Thursday/weekends is likely spinning old soul 45s (think James Brown) and everyone just gets down, in an unpretentious way. The crowd here is totally not an ""Im here-to-be-seen"" scene. My stand-by when it comes to a night out aufm Kiez. Check it out."
4,"Really nice Mexican place in the schanze! I was initially worried that I'd not find much to eat on the menu given that spicy food and I don't get along very well, but the staff recommended a few dishes I might like and I wasn't disappointed. I had a really nice mexican sandwich with an omelette and avocado - one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! Recommended for some authentic mexican food for a decent price in the Schanze."
4,"I had a great time here, the bartender knows his job. In the end he made me a Mojito with a Chocolate taste. That was Wonder full. When I'm back in Hamburg i will defintaly go back"
3,Really good food. Service was slow but other wise OK. The biggest downside was the lack of English menu.
4,"Things to know about this place: it's very centrally located, just around the corner from the Rathaus, it's actually open in the late evenings (unlike most places in this district), and it has really nice local beers (called Messing and Kupfer). The food is very decent as well."
3,Pretty nice venue for spending time with your friend enjoying some sports or a fancy night in he beach!!Regarding sports they have volleyball courts and beach tennis courts as well!They also have a bar downstairs for drinks in case you thirsty form your activities!Changing rooms are big and ithe lockers you can fit pretty much all your stuff!They also have sauna!! Suggested! ;-)
3,"Trude has a very nice location, next to the museum of labor. It is still very close to the Barmbek Station. The staff is very nice and the drinks are good. I didn't try the food, but the menu has a variety of dishes. On the menu there are different explanations/options for the name ""TRUDE"".The entrance is even with the ground."
4,"You probably won't find any better burgers here in Hamburg! Top 5 burger I've ever had, and I tried two! The 'BBQ burger' and the 'Mushroom burger'.Great beers as well and great service!If you like burgers, this is the place in Hamburg!"
3,"This restaurant is pretty good! I visited Ramen Bar Zipang on Saturday night at 6.30pm. There was already a queue but I was able to get a table within 20 minutes. I ordered a bowl of fried chicken and a chashu shoyu ramen. I enjoyed the fried chicken very much, however, although it was crispy and succulent, it was a tad too greasy for it be perfect. I also quite enjoyed the ramen. The ramen stock was thinner than what I was expecting but the portion sizes were great and the ramen was still tasty.At the end of the meal, my ramen cravings were satisfied."
4,wirklich ein sehr gutes restaurant! pizza ist hauchduenn und einfach perfekt!
4,"A wonderful French place. Relaxed and mellow, yet with great cooking. We had a enjoyable Sunday lunch. Not updated English menu. Not all positions on the menu were there. But really worth our time and the price for three corse is a bargain."
4,"This is not my first time to visit them, but a first on a weekend. The service is still very good & it all arrive on a timely manner inspite being full house. They have a nice selection of drinks for both alcoholic & non-alcoholic drinker. Definitely will go back !!"
4,Cozy and unique.I love this bar/lounge! Definitely will come back again since it has a wonderful indoor and big outdoor seating. The sofas are really stylish and probably even antique! The walls are just a master piece... its just a great place to have a drink with friends and chill out.
4,"I felt like I'm sitting in somewhere seattle where slow hip hop music surrounding with a smoke salmon omelette. Feel home, in the middle of our journey."
4,"This vegan restaurant made my Hamburg experience so much better! The food was amazing, with a great selection of different food all for a very reasonable price. The staff was wonderful, and the place was decorated with a very cute theme. The bathrooms downstairs were really nice and chock-full of amenities. I will definitely be coming back here!"
4,"Great local place with an extensive menu, well prepared fresh, local ingredients, good local wine and beer at reasonable prices."
4,"This restaurant is one of the top of the range in this district. They are not only can cook, they can also present their dishes very very nice. I'm wondering how they can have so much new ideas to cook all the time, like a magic hand.Of course you have to pay a bit more with those comfortable environment, sitting and so on but it is worth."
4,"This is a great burger joint in Hamburg.  My favorite so far in the burger joints I've checked out in the eponymous city!The closest comparison I can draw is to London's Patty & Bun - Dulf's is a messy plate-full of beefy delights, customizable in many different ways and overflowing with goodness.  The restaurant sits in the Karolinenviertel, which is a millennial area with Notting Hill-like vibes and tons of recent grad-aged people.Dulf's Burger serves 150g patties of Charolais beef - if you have never seen this French breed of cattle, then google it - spoiler alert: they're huge.  Served atop your choice of three different buns: sour dough, sesame, or brioche, the burgers are sumptuous and the toppings are plentiful.I went for the Farmer burger on a brioche bun, which comes topped with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, a fried egg, homemade burger sauce, and overflowing with coleslaw. Dulf's range of homemade burger sauces is quite impressive too: highlights include truffle, wasabi or cumin sauce....Of course, I went for the truffle sauce.I wrote a bit more about it on my blog; beeffanatic.com/2016/11/…"
4,great food. something a bit different. nice staff too.
4,"I come here for the take-out falafel wraps. I normally buy one, then walk just down the road, buy a beer from sofabar and sit in the sun with my weizen & falafel. Perfect. I am yet to sit in the restaurant, but it looks perfectly pleasant."
3,Went there for dinner. Pretty good sushi. Probably one of the best places in town to get sushi. Nice atmosphere.
4,It's a UNESCO world heritage site with a fantastic maritime flair to it. Lots of traditional bars and restaurants within walking distance from here. For photography lovers I would definitely recommend you go here during blue/golden hours.
1,"Meh. The broth had little flavor, the noodles were over cooked, and too salty. I've had some great pho other places, maybe Hamburg you should stick to other things."
3,Moraba means marmalade in Farsi and is owned by a very friendly persian Guy. Its a nice bar in the Schanze which is mostly frequented by women at the weekend who warm up for nightlife and a good place to have breakfast in the week also the best place to have a fruit juice.
4,"This place is amazing. There are three floors of very detailed exhibits. The special exhibit on the history of Germany, a comparison of various time periods, was especially fascinating. I would have enjoyed an accompanying audio tour."
4,"lovely and beautifully decorated place. very good coffee and delicious scones. the whole place gives a very personal feel, and it's a pleasure to spend time there. definitely coming again for more scones!"
4,"Really nice small café in a kind of backyard atmosphere.The staff is very friendly and seems to know something about coffee. I chose a mug of the fresh brewed filter coffee and got it served lukewarm, so the the smell had time to unfold itself. It really tasted great! The cheesecake is awesome! A dream!!!!!The interior looks nice. Simple, chic and modern. You can also buy coffee beans and brewing tools here.Definitely to recommend!"
3,"Hier gibt es das perfekte Mittagessen: tolle Salate mit Ziegenkäse und exzellentem Dressing. Außerdem abwechslungsreiche Nudelgerichte. Beides auf Wunsch als 50:50 Gericht.Qualität sehr gut, Preis leicht gehoben im Vergleich zum üblichen Mittagstisch. Einziges Manko: Restaurant Schecks wie Sodexo werden nicht angenommen!"
3,"The cheapest vegetarian place ever. You can eat and drink like a king for 8 euros. The food is top quality, the staff is a dream team of nice ladies and it's near Sankt Pauli and Schanze. After three days of hangover and greasy cooking it feels good to have some nature in your plate."
4,"Here you'll find the best burger in Hamburg, bar none. So 5 stars.However, they could really do with redecorating. It feels more like a conference room than the cosy meaty paradise that it should be. Ah well, I'm sure they'll sort that out in time.Back to the food. They have a range of about 10 burgers, all of which are going to set you back about EUR12, so they're not cheap. They are however freshly made, using fresh meat, which allows the server to ask How would you like that cooked? Rare, Medium-rare. I went for medium-rare, which anywhere else in Hamburg would be a recipe for extreme food-poisoning, but here you just get the great extra taste.Extra props for having two blue-cheese burgers on the menu."
4,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's actually really big and cute on the inside and also has a nice patio right on the canal. If you like crepes, you really can't go wrong ordering any crepe here. We tried 2 savory crepes, both the basic one with ham, cheese, and an egg and one which also includes tomato sauce and creamy mushrooms. Seriously so good. Also the people working there are all French, so you know that it must be pretty legit"
4,"Everything is great about this restaurant. Great food, great service. Maybe i'd have wished for it to have a more open space, but on the other hand it makes it more authentic with actual ""parisien"" restaurants"
3,"This one is not a restaurant, more a takeaway and a snackbar!I can recommend to take away, because its really full inside and the service its not the perfect one. But if you eat inside (or in the summer outside), the waiter is really nice and helpful!! Food: huge portions and yummy :D Some days,they are really bussy, but you should wait :D and try the dönerteller with fries :D enjoy your food!!"
3,"Delicious Pakistani food and great service (which is completely unexpected in Germany!) This is one of several locations in the city and my favorite because you can either have a nice sit-down meal in the gorgeous restaurant or have a quick meal in the little ""imbiss"" (snack) on the right side. The restaurant is beautiful with carved wood, lit candles, tiled walls and flooring, and the choice of sitting at tables with chairs or on cushions on the ground. In the snack side you can order from essentially the same menu although it it much cheaper  and a little quicker. Great curries and platters, yummy cocktails, and quick and friendly service. Definitely recommended."
1,"After experiencing the Amsterdam Dungeon, which assumed everyone attending the attraction at least spoke English, I was excited to visit the Hamburg Dungeon.  What a disappointment.Out of our party, only my Dutch husband understood German, and only at a basic level.  Since I speak Dutch myself, I got the gist of what was going on but my American parents and best friend were left in the dark save for 3 videos that had English subtitles.  We made it known our party was english speakers, but this didn't make much difference.To give the actors credit, some of them did attempt to make the scenes understood.  I was chosen to answer to crimes as a sinner in one scene and the actor easily switched to english.  However, the overall experience as a non-german speaking tourist was disappointing."
0,"The taste of the food here is very mediocre. We were very interested in this place because of our obsession with potato dishes. Very disappointing. The place itself is very cool, but... the final thing that did it for me was seeing a mouse run by the table. The place has dark lighting which is probably why most people did not see it. I told the server and he said that it was normal as they are located in a basement and surrounded by water. When I saw the mouse a second time, it had returned from the other side of the dinning room and was very close to our table. I decide we'd had enough. I asked for the bill and they not only provided zero discounts, but the serve had the audacity to point out that tips had not been charged on the bill. I simply paid (NO tips) and decided to never return.."
4,"Hmm, just another cool place to hang out with mates. typical algerian background makes it a cool palce to know how algeria tradition is. the kitchen always has several good aroma. the funny thing when you order different food with friends is that each person want to have a taste of what other mate is eating. this is all down to the good stuff from the small kitchen.after enjoying the cocos with merguerz,i just could not take any star from the ratings."
4,Very fresh and tasty hotpot. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and the service is really paying attention to the guests.funny they are twins as waiters so you always think one is next to you. The vegetables and the fish and meet is from good quality and enough to eat - even for my big hunger. The price is not that cheap but still worth for the good service and food quality and interior.We'll come again. :)
4,"(This review is best read in black and white while listening to smooth jazz.)It's like walking into a cliché!Just like there's a moment of eye-pain when you open the blinds a sunny day, there's gonna be a moment of awkwardness when you walk through the door into the super romantic ambience. Just power through. Make joke about it if necessary. Just power through.It's a place designed to get you into a warm fuzzy haze of happiness.Didn't like the chairs though. They're big and bulky, there's too many of them, and I don't like to perform self-origami just to sit down."
4,"This is *the* place to meet locals. Germans themselves say Hamburg people are reserved, but I don't agree. If you want to see reserved,  go to Sweden or google ""waiting for the bus like a swede"".Any given Friday, the place is *packed*, and not just the inside, but there's a huge crowd outside too. I love that they allow drinks outdoors. (There's a 1€ deposit for glasses, which is what you as a non German speaker won't understand that they're trying to tell you when you order.)There's happy hour until 22, which means you can order cheap drinks through a hole in a door in the back,  if you keep going past the bar.If you pass the drink hole there's a kicker table in there too.Restroom is downstairs.But I'd just recommend talking to the friendly Germans out front, so here's a few conversation starters to get you going:""What did you do last time it wasn't raining?""""Did you know that 'Katze' means cat?""or my personal favorite:""Hi, mind if I bother you a little?""(But please respect people who do mind...)"
3,"There aren't too many wine bars around Hamburg, but the Südhang is one. It's pretty hidden while at the same time being in the middle of the Schanze. You have to walk 5m off the main road towards the entrance to the wine shop, then enter the wine shop, and then go up the stairs. The menu isn't extensive, consisting mostly of pasta and salad dishes, but there should also be a few bigger meals advertised on teh blackboard. I had a pleasant time there last night. I'll probably be back."
4,"cute little bistrot in eppendorf!very friendly staff and delicious food! It's best for a sunny saturday or an early dinner and/or a glass of wine after work, since Engelke closes at 8pm. We were 3 there, and each of us had a different meal. They all tasted amazingly good and are very fresh.Actually they have a constant menu, a week menu and a daily menu, so you can't get bored from the food there. I dont have any complaints!"
3,"An excellent Nopales burrito in Hamburg?  Sure, why not!The burritos are grilled (think panini press), which gives a great crispy texture to two sides.  The nopales were nicely juicy; the strangely gooey dairy component fell somewhere between Jack and sour cream, but managed to work.  Good black beans and rice added some bulk, and there's Tapatío on the tables.Yes, Jim Burrito is known for long waits --- the sign currently warns of wait times upwards of 30 minutes --- but we got lucky and grabbed the last burritos before they closed.  Short wait this time...The friendly staff is happy in either German or English."
4,Super YUM! Walked by and got a seat inside right away. Had Spargel and salmon - it was HEAVEN.Could pay with our Visa card as well and that was helpful as not all restaurants take that.Came back again with a group of relatives and it was amazing again.Definitely can recommend!
4,"Short version: I love eating at Dean & DavidLong version: I am the biggest lover of meat and cheese so when My doctor said I needed to change my diet I was Glum, I thought you couldn't get nice food that was not full crap.  My girlfriend and I started looking for nice places that were a bit healthier and Dean & David hits the mark perfectly.I am a major fan of the Warm Thai Beef Salad and my girlfriend particularly likes the Parisian Salad, both of us are working through the juices and I am a particular fan of the Ginger Shot although it is not quite as tangy as the ginger juices we make at home.It is very helpful that this store is just round the corner from my work for grabbing something quick but seating space is a little short here and for that reason I prefer here when passing or grabbing a quick something but the one on Georgsplatz 10 when we will sit a while and take our time to eat."
0,We decided to give this place a second chance.Fortunately we had the same terrible experience like on our previous visit.The food is still terrible and the staff has absolutely no sense for hospitality whatsoever.It's really interesting that the management just responds to positive feedback here on yelp but doesn't seem to care about bad customer experiences and / or how to learn from them.
2,"Today around lunchtime I was there for the Halloween treats. Sadly the spooky cupcakes weren't ready then. But still the owner made us 5 boxes of the things - after a few special pleads.They didn't get decorated as creatively as we thought and there were only 2 different kinds (banana and raspberry) on offer but we still liked them. Very sweet and colourful things coming in a cute little pink cardboard box. A very girlish affair altogether, I'd say. 5 Euro for a box of 2 of the candy buggers. And man, they tasted very, very sweet as well, phew.Nice stuff but honestly not too breath-taking and just too sweet. And after all the are only pimped muffins ;) But I like this special Halloween event so why not go and find out for yourself. They are open until 23h tonite."
3,"From the branches of Vapiano I've visited in Hamburg, this is by far my favorite. It's often packed until the kitchen closes at 23:00 during the week (there are not many restaurants in the area so Vapiano is a default choice for many) but it's still rather large and roomy. Service is really friendly and prices are well decent. I love their shrimp penne in lobster sauce and carrots. Recommended!"
4,"Excellent Vietnamese restaurant in Hamburg?! Who'd have thought it? This is a low-key, friendly establishment, which is reasonably priced and has delicious food. The staff are so friendly that when our credit card didn't work they said, just pay next time! When does that ever happen?! Starters and mains for 3, including wine, comes to around EUR70. Recommended."
1,The place is nice but the food is definitely not authentic as is the decoration of orange slices on the plate. No spices used and we asked for Indian spicy. For someone who lived in the uk it is disappointing! The staff is friendly but it's very overpriced for what you get!
4,"Proper Irish  to the point that as an Englishman who grew up in the 70s and 80s I always feel a bit unwelcome. But that is definitely me, not them, so we come here often and if you want guinness, irish stew or great soup it's really good here. They also run a briliant Quiz night and often have irish music going on."
4,"It's a wonderful, quaint little restaurant.  The staff was friendly and helpful with understanding the menu.  My German is nonexistent.  The entrees change weekly and the dish I ordered was full of flavor.  The appetizers were authentic and tasty.  Overall it is a nice place."
4,"Found my coffee joint in Hamburg!! Tons of space. Great light hip vibes. Amazing coffee at amazing prices. Whether it's to meditate on your beans, get work done, or meet up for a chat, this is the joint. They source from Five Elephant and some other roasters! This place is the real deal! Hit this place up. Foreigners are welcome hahahaha.. I think? Friendly staff and people."
3,"I happened across this place the other night after coming out of a flat viewing. I have to say the outside looks a bit circumspect, but I noticed that every table outside was taken, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. We sat by a window table inside instead, which was actually as good as being outside but not as cold, and had the filet steak, and a (forgive my spelling) schnitzel. The food wasn't bad at all, the service was great, and the beer was nice too. So all in all, it's not bad! (forgot to mention - apparently they have DJs on here too - but don't know what they're like!)"
4,"These type of traditional places are disappearing quickly...don't miss this one. Close to the Hauptbahnhof, great for a quick meal and a beer!"
4,"This cute little restaurant serves an amazing breakfast! You can choose between elk salami, boiled eggs with caviar cream, semolina pudding with fruit and various other delicious things! The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. Reservation recommended!"
3,"We had a nice dinner in this Turkish restaurant yesterday night. Everything started kind of meh because we had to go tell Ikea to f****** deliver all the stuff that they should have delivered. But this is a story that I'll tell in a separate review. Once we were out of the blue monster, we were in need of some sustenance. I remembered walking past this large Turkish restaurant which looked promising, so I brought us there. The location is right next to the Altona Bahnhof, so convenient to come with the S1.Even though the restaurant was quite busy, we were seated right away. All the dishes on the menu have pictures, so just point to whatever looks good. For me it was the Döner Teller mit Kalb for € 8,50. There was no beer on the menu (or I couldn't find it), so I picked the closest thing, a big Apfelschorle. It certainly looked like a beer when it arrived with a nice beer head.The food was very tasty. The Döner meat was grilled and tasty and all the sides (yogurt, tomato, cucumber, onion, rice, etc.) were very good as well. There was plenty of food, enough to make me wonder whether I should take some home. But I powered on and finished my whole plate.Service was nice and attentive, I just wished our drinks arrived a little bit faster than they did."
2,"As a New Yorker, I had to try a hamburger in Hamburg.  Fast food taken to a higher level.  The decor was modern and stylish, with great music and no paper/styrofoam here, real plates and flatware.The burger was good, not great or memorable, as were the sides.  Overall, a good experience and much better than any fast food alternative.  If you are looking for a quick, yet stylish, burger meal, this is a must try."
4,"This place has great coffee! The food was fresh and quick and very reasonably priced. The staff were friendly and efficient. Plus, they allow dogs!"
2,The food is good.. but it takes too long to get the food .  Don't go there too hungry! You might start pulling your hair
3,Very nice Thai restaurant in the Hafencity! Interior is nice and cosy.The menu is great and not too many dishes on there so one can keep a good overview :-)Worth a try
4,"Delicious German food our beautifully rustic atmosphere. We had the Rinderroulade and Pannfisch, which both were delicious.The staff is super friendly and helpful. Added with a bit of luck you also get to meet the house's dog."
3,"I ordered vegetarian pizza without cheese. It was good, but not heavenly good. I would prefer less tomato sources and more olive oil. But vegan pizzas are not easy to handle. Pizza was served in a shape of heart with really beautiful arrangement of seasonal vegetables on top. Extra points for this. I like a little crazy vibe of the place a lot, cooks   flirting and guests singing together, amazing place for weekend dinner!"
4,best 24 hour tuerkisch place in hamburg! love the service! have been schlepping everyone here since decades. good comfort food right when feeling a cold or flue wanting to creep out of the system!
3,"My roommate loves pasta and she wanted to come along to my last nice dinner with my boyfriend who was visiting for the weekend, so of course I took her recommendation but na klar did not take her along. Ordered the creamy salmon pasta - nice saltiness, perfectly fatty sauce with generous chunks of cooked salmon wrapped inside the noodles. Partner got the simple tomato sauce pasta - it was a bit on the plain side and a bit too salty, particularly with extra Parmesan. The Parmesan in itself was a highlight though - this cute, bright grater that looked like a children's toy was filled to the brim with real Parmesan AND left at our table so we could indulge ad hoc in Parma heaven. We also had some house wine, which was very generous for the price, and the setting was also very cute - I had some doubts about the location, right next to Landungsbrücke, but Pastalozzi is off on a side street and we were the only ones sitting at a dimly lit, dark oak table in the back. Also candles! What romance! Parmagnificent."
2,"I don't know too many vegan places and being vegetarian, I simply enjoyed having the full choice of the menu :-) The dishes are Asian and I was very satisfied with my veggies and cashews in a slightly coconutty sauce. Service is friendly too and even though we had booked for 8, our nine-plus-dog group was accommodated without problems. There is no alcohol but a number of juice and tea options instead. You can even get vegan cakes and icecream. The only drawback - the place could really have been cleaner with some stains on the tablecloth covered by the place mats. Otherwise it's a lovely place, brightly lit and with some quirky decorations making it very cheerful."
3,"Our continued search to find some of the best Neapolitan style pizza in Hamburg led us here. And it's definitely a new favorite for my wife and I. Very good flavor for both pizzas we tried and a tasty and pretty chewy crust as well, however, the crust was slightly thinner and a little bit crisper than I would have liked for a standard Neapolitan pizza.The restaurant is a very spacious area, with a pleasant rustic and warming setting and atmosphere, and with plenty of outdoor seating as well."
3,"We'd ridden the trains all day, toured Hamburg, and were hungry! The Nagel bierstube has great beer (Nagelbrau is a nice dark beer) and good traditional fare. The schnitzel is satisfying and the prices are reasonable. You could do a lot worse and walk a lot further. I was very happy, and so was my partner. Also, they have a full bar!"
3,"This is a very cozy and nice place to hang out and grab some food with friends. They have great vegetarian/vegan choices and are a good pick for people who like the middle-eastern cuisine. Unfortunately they were out of a few things that I wanted to try when we were there but my overall experience was still good. The prices are very good, too!"
3,"I really like this place. If I wasn't leaving Hamburg this week, it'd probably become my go-to lunch spot for a relatively healthy yet filling meal. It has a calm vibe and serves mainly German pasta and salad dishes (although not exclusively) and also offers pastries and coffees. There's a daily menu, and I've found the food really fresh tasting. You get served fresh bread with each meal, and the prices are reasonable. Check it out! It's nothing special but a solid place I'd recommend trying for lunch."
4,"Olympisches Feuer doesn't look like much from the outside. The sign looks like a pretty bad relic from the 80s and the menu - superficially - looks even worse. However, don't judge a book by it's cover Olympisches Feuer does some of the best food in the Schanze and does it at a great price. I recommend the Gyros mit Metaxasousse. Yum. On Saturday afternoons they normally do the lunch menu until 3pm, and then you can stay and watch the German football on the flatscreens!"
3,"This place opened recently around the corner from me. I never really went in until a few weeks ago since it was always either closed or seemed closed because of how empty and sterile it looked. Finally managed to get myself to go here for dinner and was surprised at what a wonderful selection they had for vegetarians. Myself, I'm not a tofu fan, but if you are they've got tons of tofu options. I had a Quesadilla which was much too big for me to finish. The price was good and the service was super friendly - the guy at the counter took the time to explain what everything was. 4 stars because this is a good and solid all-around eatery. One star off for how sterile this place feels. I wish they'd up the decor a bit and make it feel a bit more warm and welcoming."
3,Ordered burger champignon and tartufo. Both good. CP - value good. An economic choice in between all touristic places.
4,"The place is my personal Vietnamese heaven. Veggie soup is very tasty and filling. A delicate veggie broth, rice noodles, tofu and green vegetables - that is what you get as a vegetarian/vegan pho option for 7 euros. So worth the money! Another vegan option I can suggest is a noodle salad with tofu. It's very flavorful and refreshing, but ask about fish sauce in advance!   Will come back for sure!"
4,"main place to get food for me. it's cheap, it's tasty and it's fast  what the hell more would you need?"
2,"Your typical Irish bar. Probably the most authentic in Hamburg. Very traditional interior. Dark lighting so a good place to come and hide. Very friendly service. The beer's good. Location is easy to reach right on Grossneumarkt. There's outdoor seating during the warmer months. I've only tested some of their food and it was always good. Nothing spectacular but definitely enjoyable. The only thing I really dislike about this place is that at times it can be really full and there isn't that much seating available inside. Further, service can be a bit slow at times and is often pre-occupied with chatting at the bar as opposed to keeping glasses full. If you're into the Irish thing though a perfect jaunt for you in Hamburg."
4,"I'm from Hamburg and I think it was a lot of fun! I saw a lot of people complaining that they didn't understand much when they went there, because it was all in German. Well, I understand that the flyer is in English too, and if you'd do a little bit of research you""d know that they have English tours on Fridays and Saturdays at 10 am.I took my american boyfriend there and he said he had no problem understanding anything and that he loved it. I just wanted to give the tip that they do have english tours, and you can book the tickets online, they are cheaper and you wont have to wait in the cold or outside. When you know the right tricks you wont ever have to wait and it will be great! Also you always have to pay for pictures wherever you go, like in amusement parks, its just a thing to be expected"
4,"We got there pretty late, probably 30min before closed. Still a lot of people there. It is really popular. I had shrimp pho, and my friend had no 7. Both are pretty good. Wanna try the drinks next time. 很好吃，并不是特别地道但是融合的很不错，下次还会再来。想尝尝喝的，看到别的桌喝的，看起来很好喝"
4,"Simple, small place but food is fantastic. Probably the only Indian in Hamburg which offers authentic food."
2,"I've eaten at vegetarian restaurants a lot and have plenty of experience with them. I was actually on my way to somewhere else that had a good yelp review, when I saw Loving Hut and decided to stop here instead.Figuring out a vegan Vietnamese menu that is written in German when you only speak English is a bit of a challenge. Lots of words like ""tofu"", ""reis"" and ""soja"" were obvious enough. I felt pretty comfortable ordering with my limited understanding of the menu. I got number 29, which was spicy vegetables and tofu (aren't they all? I don't know). It was good. The proprietor spoke enough English to make it work.Prices are reasonable, but its cash only. They do not serve any alcohol at all. Service is pretty slow because there aren't too many people working the (just 2?). Still, I didn't find the wait bad. Just a little noticeable. If I had a bottle of white wine, I might not have noticed the wait at all. Hint hint.The joy of finding a place that serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan foods is diminished somewhat because the food is just so-so. It's not brilliant, but its not at all bad. I thought my order was a little light on tofu. Just 5 or 6 pieces. I asked fir it spicy, though, and i got what i asked for. The appetiser we ordered was something akin to vegetarian breaded fried prawns. They weren't much to speak of."
3,"I stopped in after ready all reviews, I code the Eva's chicken burger with cheese, reminds remoulade  sauce and potatoes,  everything was great, potatoes were cooked perfectly, the chicken burger was perfectly cooked and the best part was the remoulade sauce.  I really recommend this quaint little place."
4,"Really good street food very good Chana bhatura - pretty fast service it's always busy so give yourself some time to find a seat, but I totally recommend i."
4,I haven't found a better place to eat good fish in Hamburg yet. The place is really busy but it is definetly worth waiting for a table. Try the Taschenkrebs 'natural' and the Jakobsmuschel-Spiesse!
3,Pizza Siciliana was great but the pizza Diavola was extremely spicy! I love spicy food but it was too much.
2,"We went to Le Xich Lo for a late Friday lunch.. I had high hopes for this place because I enjoy food from the region and always prefer authentic restaurants.The waitress was not at all friendly. It was quite obvious that she'd rather have a short of break at this time than serve us. I even had to reason with her why I would like to have some more chili sauce.The food wasn't really a highlight either. The soup was luke warm at best and tested boring. For a national dish I'd expected a bit more. As a starter I tried frog legs which weren't impressive either. They were totally over-seasoned and chewy. The 3 stars are for the Mango Curry my wife had, that was actually very tasty. The only plus for this place."
4,"Over the years I have managed to go to the bird every time i am in hamburg. i have been to hamburg many times. and the bird is a highlight. The fries are fresh potatoes and the burgers re ridiculously good. they are fat, mine are bloody red, juicy, and messy. served on an english muffin which is a nice touch. full bar, awesome staff, and punk rock at heart. i have had the steak once- ribeye- and it was great, but the burgers really are the main attraction. lots of choices in preparation, i go basic cheese with an egg (the dumb texan) but the big rock is great, and my vegetarian pals  say the black bean option is killer. the bird is worth your time."
4,"Lovely café with some places downstairs and more upstairs. One room upstairs is furnished like a livingroom of your grandma could be, with some cozy armchairs, sofas, coffee tables and wallpapered walls!I can't tell if the breakfast there is good, because I couldn't snatch a free table. But I assume it really is, because the seats to brunch on a sunday are fully booked two weeks in advance! SO MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION EARLY ENOUGH! Tip: if this place is crowded, go to the café called Caffeé Latte. It's just a few metres down the street and not as big as that place. They have some nice breakfasts as well!"
3,"Having moved recently near to this location we finally were able to try it out. I had heard of the place fairly soon after it opened but the opportunity to visit simply didn't present itself. Well, now it had.There has been enough written about this location in German so I won't go into too many specifics. High-end location with lots of windows. Modern design with well spaced out tables. I found the ambiance and seating comfortable. Service was top notch while we were there and everyone who came by out table was extremely professional. The food itself was also top notch. We had sushi and everything was of the best quality and very well prepared. I liked the selection and found the prices to be representative of the quality as well as area. Yes, it's kind of expensive but what do you expect in Eppendorf and when it's Henssler? All in all, a very good experience and we'll be back. I left out one star simply because this place does lack a bit of soul. It's definitely all good in terms of food, service, location etc. but somehow I didn't get the feeling that this is place which will have lots of regulars and will be used as a ""hang out"" for the inside crowd. Somehow Steffen's place down by the docks has a better vibe to it (be that vibe good or bad). Ono just hasn't come into it's own at this point. Maybe it will and if so, I will update my review. Until then, I am looking forward to grabbing sushi here again soon."
3,Sausalitos in Hamburg is situated in Chilehaus which is a very nice old office building. I have heard of Sausalitos from friends in other German cities. We tried some of the cocktails and finger-food. It was pretty good. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the waitresses were nice. Sausalitos is definitely worth a try.
4,This was such an eye opening experience. I would recommend everyone to give this museum a chance and let it show you a different world.
2,"Value for money: far to expensiveService: needs training, to pushyLocation: interestingFood: good to averageBeen there a few more times invited on business expenses, the concept is interesting so is the location, but thats where the good news ends. Food quality and preparation varies and for my taste it's a notch above average. I used to live for several years in Japan and in California and comparing H&H to the benchmark the verdict is a simple one. How to improve: we all know money is made with beverages: Train your staff to stop being pushy. I am the guest and I will let you know if and when I want a new bottle of whatever. Train your staff on products you offer and of course on  the daily menue. To stay polite I will not post the answers I received on simple questions. Yes you have a nice winelist but where is some ""exquisit"" sake to go with ...? Lastly: attitude ... You want to play in the major league? Well you certainly have the right foundation, but there there is plentiful to improve if you really want to get there. Treat EVERY guest with respect not only your so called whatever VIPs. H&H has a good name in Hamburg I was told, but a name I can not eat, smell or drink for that matter. You guys can do far better. At present it is only 3/5 stars with the third one for the potential. Will be there again in late May. Hopefully we can see some kind of improvement."
3,"Monet, Renoir, Degas, Nardin, Valjoux, Rado, and Piaget!And if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that those last four are not French impressionists, they're Swiss watchmakers.Anyway, Kunsthalle is about as much fun as watching paint dry, as visiting this place basically amounts to three hours of watching dry paint. It's a very, very classic art museum. Mostly framed oil works, a little sculpture, a little modern art... not very stimulating to a layperson like me who just doesn't go for this stuff.So I'm not the best person to ask, but I think I can safely say this is a classic, non-interactive, super-quiet, admire-only, hands-off museum. Tickets are reasonably priced, they have student discounts, and all of the captions have English and German. Very Anglo/American friendly."
3,"I brought a group of 9 on a Saturday with a last minute reservation for 8, which normally doesn't work because they're usually full. So I was worried, but it was surprisingly quiet that evening and we got a very nice room to ourselves with room for many more than our single tag-along guest. We were fortunate.But such popularity comes at a cost. I don't remember the prices being so high and the portion sizes so small for dishes which are relatively simple to prepare. €3.50 for a side of Bratkartoffeln. It couldn't have been more than 1 potato. (See photo)The service was excellent, as I expected it would be. Very observant waiters with a sense of humor. Although if you have a problem with your food (my friend didn't like the Pulled Pork Burger -- not enough BBQ flavor, which I agree with) they will look at you surprised and defend it and discuss it and deny it until finally they offer something to compensate. But that's typical of every Hamburg restaurant I've been to in the last 6 years. Even the foreign restaurants adopt this local attitude that nothing can ever be wrong with their food.But I have to reduce my review to 4 stars because, while the food is generally good and the service great (by German standards), they appear to be positioning themselves as something exclusive and gourmet by serving more porcelain than food and then charging an arm and a leg for it -- which would only be justifiable if the dishes were delicacies."
3,"We had a good experience at this restaurant. My husband had the original LABSKAUS and really liked it, I had SCHNITZELS with lemon and ate it all, it was delicious. Service was excellent and in English! The atmosphere was friendly and family oriented, we do recommend this place."
4,"Fabulous food menu changes daily. Today, soup, pasta and chicken and rice with curry tomatoe sauce.  Not a big curry fan but this was fabulous!!!  She sells all kinds of cookbooks too."
3,"Ay Carumba! Casa Franco is so much fun. I came here last night with some friends and I had a great time. For 27 euros you get a four-course meal complete with a flaming scallop starter, fish, more fish, and a delicious dessert. Mmm. The owner of the restaurant is fantastic. He's so attentive to his customers and makes a huge effort to entertain the entire restaurant. We got several free shots of alcohol and the entire restaurant toasts together. The atmosphere is cozy, festive, and lively. There was even a traditional guitar singer that serenaded us twice in the night. My favorite part of my four course meal was the parrot fish and the crème brûlée-like dessert. I'm not sure what it was, but it was GOOD. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was 22 euros a bottle. I'd say the style of the food was Portuguese fusion. The fun part is that the chef decides what you will eat so you don't have to order your food. The fish that he served us was extremely fresh. I think this is a great place to go with some friends or to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday. At the end of the meal, the owner also gives the ladies a single rose. :) Four solid stars for the food, and 7 stars for the service. I'll most likely be back!"
4,"Headed to luigis after a long day after hearing some really great things about it and i was not disappointed! Me and my dad had a pizza and pasta to share and both were really great. Although there was a little queue to get a seat, it moved really quickly and the wait was definitely worth it. Very reasonably priced pizzas and pastas, and great drinks as well! Definitely will come back!!!"
3,"Oma's pork schnitzel with fried bacon & onion bits is possibly my favourite thing to eat in Hamburg, and as they also serve Duckstein then you can't go wrong with a visit here. The portions also managed to keep 8 very hungry skateboarders appetites sated on my last trip over, and also the veggie option was a winner with our token vegetarian.I try and eat here at least once every visit, and I've also had a good night propping up the bar sampling the beers. Visit!!"
2,"Nice and warm and filled with manily uni students this is a great little place for lunch as it's near the Uni, cheap, fast and effective. Their soup and bread is yummy, filling and a bargin. There's plenty of other things on the menu if soup isn't your thing, pizza, bagels, pasta etc... the coffee is drinkable too."
3,"Great French pastries and good coffee as well! Nice tortellettes and eclairs. Friendly service. Has cute French photos decorating the walls. Is unfortunately a bit too small for my taste (also no toilet)  there were only 2 tables inside, making it more of a Stehcafé where you can stop for a quick yummy French treat. Wish they could expand so you could really enjoy sitting there for a while!Recommended for a short stop in Paris!"
4,best rolls in town! check kleine-konditorei.com
4,"First time in Germany and my boss recomended to visit this place after work. It reminded me of a quaint French Bistro that found its place in Germany. I ordered a glass of wine and the potato and leek soup. The soup was a great consistency and pretty filling. Don't forget the bread that was served, in which I asked for some olive oil. I was brought some sea salt that went well with my bread. If you want to relax with a nice glass of wine afterwork. Try Tati's Bistro!!!!"
4,"Sehr schönes, gemütliches Café/Bistro mit toller Getränke- und Speisekarte im Shenzhen Schanzenviertel. Die Pfannekuchen und Säfte kann ich besonders empfehlen. Preisklasse: mittel, aber definitiv jeden Cert wert!"
3,"This is one of the numerous beach bars in Hamburg and one of my favourites.Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and of course outdoor heating!Wooden structures usually serve as large bars and most beach bars, including this one, serve a small selection of food as well. Though the real reason to come here is to stick your feet in the sand and slurp a cocktail or two. Many Hamburgers like to come to these bars after work to chill out a bit in the spring and summer. You can watch the industry harbour from here, which is a nice offset for the kitsch tropical decor of Strand Pauli. It's a brilliant place to grab a nice drink after a long day, though it does get crowded at times. As long as you can grab some comfy seating, just sit back and enjoy!"
3,"The Hamburg Dungeon is an interactive journey through the dark history of Hamburg, with actors explaining about e.g. Black Death, the great fire or pirate Störtebeker. Within groups you enter room by room, where the actors wait for you. Everything is a little spooky and therefore there is a minimum age of 10 years old to enter the Dungeon. Enjoy!"
4,"Really good oriental food. A really nice and cosy place too. Looks good from the outside as it does from the inside. The food is fresh and quick for a very reasonable price. It was crowded but not too loud. I went there with two friends. We all had different meals but everything arrived at the same time. The kumpir was perfectly cooked and the topping was delicious. My friend had a mixed starter plate which we shared but couldn't finish at all. The tea was perfect with the flavoures of our meals.Service was pretty friendly as well. Actually as I write this review, I am getting hungry and want to go there immediately I recommend this place for anyone who wants solid, good food and nice atmosphere before going out."
4,"My favorite falafel place ever!!! I used to live in Hamburg and bike here often. My favorite was the falafel Teller box. So many delicious things on one plate. They make them in house and hot and fresh in front of you. I also like their mint tea. And they were always friendly even though I didn't speak German well. I live back in San Francisco now, but my boyfriend and his band are in Hamburg today to play a concert and I told him to go here! He has heard me talk about it a bunch!Totally worth the visit and it's in a great neighborhood w tons of rad shops near by."
4,"Delicious! This place was small, but with a great personality.  The food was great and they gave my boyfriend and I huge portions.  I had the lox bagel with eggs and he had a fried mix fish platter.  The menu was in German and so we just used Google translate.  The staff was nice, attentive, and spoke some English.  No wifi."
3,"Don't know why Oma decided to name this place Apotheke, when it is in fact a bar / restaurant, but however bad his marketing skills are there is no doubt he cook some banging food. I played it safe with a tasty French Onion soup inside a bowl made of bread (only ever seen this done previously in Austria), which was gorgeous and more than enough for a meal in its own right. Bargain for the 5EUR it cost me. My fellow dinner guests followed suit, except for one brave soul who plumped for the cheeseburger, which was so big it could have given Chunk (thebestsportsblog.com/im…) a run for his money."
3,"Really nice new-ish place on the catwalk that is Schuterblatt, hence, a bloody good venue from which to enjoy a cold Augustinabrau. The signs on the toilet doors to indicate the correct genders permitted are not to be missed!"
3,Bored on Sunday night and want to drink till 4am with loads of old people instead of thinking about work? Here's your venue!
2,"I found the place a bit over-priced for what you get. Standard Thai food without that extensive a menu. Further, service was mediocre at best. No one went the extra mile and it was default all night. Lots of people have already spoken well of the location and ambiance. I'd say it's good but not outstanding. There are better views of the harbor as well as in the Hafencity. Finally, I found the bathrooms to not be that clean. I was already there pretty late in the evening but if you are going to charge these prices, make sure someone is regularly keeping the washrooms tidy. I probably wouldn't go back, mostly due to the pricing for average Thai food. It's worth checking out though if you must do something in the Hafencity and you like Thai. Maybe we just hit a bad night for the chef."
4,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here during our stay in Hamburg and I can safely say it was the best meal of my life. Armando was incredibly friendly and accommodating (since I'm a vegetarian.) Each of the four courses was better than the last, and the wine pairing was excellent. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys food. Wonderful, wonderful experience!"
3,The BallinStadt Auswanderermuseum is located close to Veddel S-Bahn Station at the old location where the emigrants stayed before the left for their new lives. The museum explains the lives of the emigrants in Hamburg and shows where they emigrated to. It is also possible to search for ancestors but I was a bit disappointed that there was not a good explanation how to search.
4,"Amazing place to spend your day. Depending on how crowded it is and what you prefer to do, you can easily spend hours here. You can also only send an hour or two if that's your preference. I was with a group no one in the group had been there before. It also shares a building with a Dungeon museum as well. It's a few flights of stairs up to the ticket area and there is an elevator as well. The lines are split up into no reservations, reservations, and private tours I believe was the last one. The day we went was very very busy. When we went to buy tickets we had the option of waiting a few hours until the crowd thinned out or come back later that night. There was a store and cafeteria that also served as the waiting area I believe but we chose to come back later. I thought it paid off as it wasn't as busy later in the night. It was open until 1 am which was great but surprising. The souvenier store serves as the entrance and exit. There are tons of good toys and trinkets which I bought a few on the way out. We didn't get a chance to eat at the cafeteria but it looked like typical cafeteria food with drinks and snacks as well. The seating area, which there were tons of seats, was all old airplane seats. Mostly two seaters facing each other with tables. Cool set up. The actual museum starts with the history of the museum and how it started. They have headsets, which are in English as well, that explain the first few exhibits. The workshop areas were also here. Because of how late it was, they were all pretty empty. Once you get past that, the ""real"" part of the museum starts. Miniature set ups of all types. Sweden, USA, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and a few more I believe. There is also a working airport as well and other little random displays. If I had to use one word, mind blowing would be it. The amount of detail and the displays are amazing. There was a set up of a live out door festival which was pretty spot on, like almost everything there. The displays also change times of the day, I want to say every 15 minutes or so, so the same displays now come to life via the night. Lights turn on, headlights, street lights, etc, Many parts are also moving with a push of the button so there is tons to see whether its night or day. This is where you can send hours on each display just studying all of the little things going on. Most of the displays also have a ledge to stand on so you can lean over and see closer. This is also where big crowds here can get difficult. The working airport is one of my favorite parts. Planes of all types take off and land and gate and refuel, load, etc. It's pretty amazing. If you're a Star Wars fan, there are definitely a few references which you'll have to pay attention to spot. Definitely one of the coolest places I've been to in a very long time. I will definitely be back."
3,"Thanks for the great experience. The place had it all, great tasting food and beer. Staff was friendly. Great ambiance. We had no problem getting seated or finding parking. Odd location and a bit tricky to get to.Thanks for the positive experience."
3,"This little beach bar is a Hamburg institution. Little did I know when I got there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon that they're actually open year-round. You can't really miss it as it's located in an old hut right at the beach Övelgönne.With 37F out there people were sunbathing (wrapped in their jackets like Eskimos, of course) and it's clear that this is one of Hamburg's hot spots to chill (or walk the beach).Strandperle serves coffee & tea, as well as soups and snacks. It's usually packed but the line moved quickly when I was there.I admit that I'm a tourist in Hamburg but this place is on my list whenever I'm back in the city."
4,"Great burgers, nice staff, and plenty of outside seating protected from the rain."
4,"I seriously can't believe that I forgot to review Gloria. Busy busy I guess. Anyway I've been a few times for their Sunday brunch buffet. It's not cheap at EUR13, but boy is it good! Check out the photos..."
4,"This is a great place to go to if you want to see loads of sharks and other wild animals but my experience was pretty differant as i was there for Qype's 5th Birthday which was amazing.The hospitality was good as it was a champagne reception and nice food, but as the night went on it got better but maybe it was due to the unlimited bar tab lol but i would definatly go back and take my son for the sharks and other wild life."
4,"The best burger's restaurant, I've ever been. Burger was delicious had a lot of ingredients and perfect grilled meat."
4,"I came here for breakfast and it was very good. I got sunny side up eggs with toast. The egg yolks were way over done, but besides that it was very good (and the chives in the eggs were good - although they are .50 euros more). The fruit in yogurt was okay - nothing special, but the fruit itself was very good and a generous amount. The ginger tea was also interesting."
4,"Just go to this restaurant. If you want to eat the food that's cooked in India, this is the place. We took chicken palak and okra thali and samosa as starters. Oh god! I never ate samosa taste like how it should be before I came here. The food was tasty, filling and quick. This is how you would probably eat at food corners in India. Go badshah!"
4,"As an Asian, I have to say the dish: number 54 reminds me of what I had back in  Asia. Really great and I'm positing this for the Asians, if you want really good 酸笋鸭米粉汤面 ( duck with bamboo, #54)this is the place! There is no other places in Hamburg which has this soup! (in 2015) The service was good and fast. taste exactly like what I expected a Vietnamese restaurant should have. ;) PS : I'm also positing some pictures , which I would recommend to order. ;)"
3,"Scandinavian style, with wooden tables. They also have toys and books to keep the kids entertained. The menu is in german but the waitress kindly translated it for us. They have tasty dishes for an healthy lunch."
4,I didn't try the sweet goodies; instead I had a pasta. Pretty delicious at a very cheap price.
4,Very nice place. Friendly people. Brunch has very good choice of different meals.
3,Don't know much about sushi. But at least that one was the best i've ever had. I recommend the beef topping.
3,"This place is always packed with young people. Very nice atmosphere and extremely cheap coffee. You can buy there soft drinks, snacks and cakes too."
4,"The ""Strandperle"" is located at the beach in Övelgönne. To get here - you can take the ferry from Landungsbrücken or the bus from the main station (approx. 20 minutes). It is one of the best places to chill out in Hamburg. You can buy lots of kinds of drinks and some nice snacks at the ""Strandperle""."
4,"Ich war das erste Mal im Locks und war total begeistert. Der Service war erste Klasse und das Essen oberlecker. Es war knacke voll ab 19 Uhr, aber für mich steht fest ... ich weiß, wo ich wieder hin gehe."
1,"Should have listened to the reviews. We waited an hour (we were told upfront though that we'd have to wait a bit as they were too busy until 4pm) but it was quite a let-down especially for the price. Two meager lamb ""bon-bons"" on sautéed spinach and boiled potatoes. Dry bird on the same spinach-potato bed in some canned tasting tomato-sauce. The only good thing was the homemade tea lemonade. Ambience is ok but overpriced and meh. Lackluster service. Spend your dollars elsewhere."
3,"Very nice authentic Mexican restaurant. Good food, and pleasant service. Our waiter didn't know anything about the food or about drinks but he always had a smile on his face which made everything great. Would go here again"
3,"ruehrei war lecker, orientalisches Fruehstueck haette groesser ausfallen koennen"
3,"I very much enjoyed my visit to Golden! I was staying at a hotel down the street, and decided I had a taste for Chinese food. Seeing that there was a positively-reviewed place just a short walk away, I decided to get take away and bring it back to my room.The staff was very friendly when I arrived. After a few minutes looking over the menu, I decided on a beef dish that was supposed to be spicy. Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact name of the dish. While I waited, I looked around the restaurant itself which was clean and comfortable, if not a little dark. The food came out relatively quickly, and I walked back to my hotel. Once settled down, I ripped in to the bag and found a lot of food (for the price), and it was very delicious as well! The dish was not very spicy, which was disappointing, but I am used to that - most places are not spicy enough for me.I would certainly return to Golden if I were in the area for the friendly staff, good prices and delicious food."
0,"The burgers do not taste very good. The double patty burgers have the same amount of meat as a standard single patty burger. I ordered a rare hamburger and it came as well done. My girlfriend ordered a cheeseburger and it came with burnt cheese. When we sent it back, they said it was supposed to be crusty cheese. Cheese melted to a crust can be delicious, however the cheese was just burnt. I recommend going to the Brooklyn burger bar, its very close. Make reservations."
3,"Very nice experience!  The food was surprisingly fresh tasting for a chain.  The salad was good, I highly recommend when getting a sandwich or a soup (as I did) adding the salad for and extra euro.  Everything can be taken to go!  Something I have noticed becoming the ""new trend"" in gastronomy in Hamburg.  I can remember when even coffee was never served in a togo cup!Dean & David was great! Nice location and decor.  Free Wifi if you are looking for a nice place to get some work done!Check it out!"
4,"The food is amazing, once you get into the place it doesn't looks good but it is worth it"
4,"Excellent food and service! They were very nice and polite, it was an amazing experience. And the price is completely affordable. Excellent option for breakfast!"
4,"We (Dave) has been looking for his ""holy grail"" of Restaurants in every country! This was it for Hamburg! The service, food and ambience was all 5 stars! They don't have an English menu, so the very patient server walked us through the whole thing then recommended an amazing French wine that complimented the meal perfectly! If in Hamburg, this is a must try! The menu has something for everyone! Vegetarian and carnivore! It's considered modern European and it does not disappoint!"
3,"I went there based on the numerous positive suggestions. It is in the basement of the building on a pretty little street. I had called in with a reservation request and they promised me that a table would be open. But once I got there, still had to wait 10 minutes to sit down, which was a bit of a bummer. I ordered a Salmon, Spinach and Tomato savory crepe. It took a while to get but it was very delish. The salmon was a bit salty but very flavorful. I went for a sweet crepe (sugar and lime) and that was even better than the savory option.My recommendation is for you to stick to the sweet options if you decide to check it out. They are far superior and just as good as the ones you get on the streets of the City of Lights."
3,"I was visiting the Miniature Wonderland and looked up restaurants that accept credit cards because a lot of the dining options around there only accept cash. I didn't convert my money as I was stopping in there for only a day. Figured you can use your card to pay at most dining establishments. Well, apparently not in Hamburg. When I tried to pay for my delicious crepe with a warm pear, I was told it was cash only. I offered to leave my card with them while I hunted down an ATM, but the obviously bothered waiter ran downstairs to get a POS machine and accepted my MasterCard. I tried to add a tip but was told they cannot add it to the card sale even though the print out indicated that option. Food and coffee were both amazing and they even offered me an English menu. I recommend this locale but be ready with local currency."
4,"Excellent food, very special action. This is a unique experience! Never had a better experience in a fish restaurant!After a few days here is a little more detailed review:We arrived at Casa Franco and got an ""dude"" welcome. We were placed in the middle of the restaurant and it seemed uncomfortable at the beginning. My wife and me got seated at a 6 seater with just one couple with us. The tender told us, that he is the menu tonite, so we don't need to read. Decision was easy: he asked us if we want fish, meat or vegetarian. We decided to go with the fish menu. As start we got olives with tasty bread and kind of mayonnaise-garlic sauce. After a while the flambed scampi arrived and that was a big start!! The second course was a super tasty mix of tuna and pike-perch fish. This was the time we realized that everybody in the room took the fish menu - and they started to serve the courses simultaneously. After the second course they served a shot for everybody with general salut! After a while one of the tenders showed up with the next course - in raw format. It was a loach and a kind of a big fish! Meanwhile a guitar singer walked through the room and gave us a big Portuguese feeling with singing pretty good and impulsive!The third course arrived and that was a big one! The Loach of course and a super tasty sword-fish we're served with tasty vegetable. Each fish got his own sauce (as with every course) and it was great! The dessert was good and after that another shot arrived. Each course and shot was announced once to the entire audience.With all that, we experienced a great dinner with a feeling of being big friends to guest at friends! While leaving every women got a rose as gift and after talking to the manager and thanking big for the great dinner, he passed a bottle of Rioja to me.Thank you ""Casa Franco"" team for this unique experience! We will definitely come back!Addendum: when arriving you might think ""WTF"" but don't judge on this - this one is one of the best fish restaurants I've ever bin."
4,"What a unique and fascinating experience we had at Miniatur Wunderland! It is simply incredible to see the excitement and enthusiasm in the eyes of the children and their parents, while wondering through the Mini-World. So many little details to see and discover, all kinds of dramas and events have been carefully put into life in America, in Hambourg, at Frankfurt-Airport, in Berlin, in Switzerland, Austria or Italy ...! hours are not enough to really take in all one can contemplate in Miniatur Wunderland! We loved it, and will definitely go there again!"
4,"CASA FRANCO FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I came here twice with the company I was working for. Since my boss always paid for everything.BUT I'M SURE IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE :D I think if I'd know the prices, I would pretty much give it ZERO stars hahahah. kidding :)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, what we always got was:HUGE SCAMPIES ROASTET IN OIL + ALCOHOL served in huge flamesA PLATE WITH DIFFERENT FISH FILETS + a unique secret sauce made by FrancoSTEAK, small peaces of steak with different sauces.and more.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Honestly I don't remember it all but I know you get a lot, and all the seafood you get are really really delicious.I remember I dropped the whole steak I picked it up and still ate it, that's how good it was. But I was drunk anyways haha.LOCATION: Very very small, I guess about 20 people max. It's great, because it gives you a nice familiar cozy atmosphere.If you have the money and wanna do yourself somethiing good. Come here."
1,"Super unimpressed with this place. We were expecting so much more since the concept was appealing and a bit of hype had been dispensed about this place. Unfortunately, the concept falls flat on its face. Currently still a trendy spot and hence fairly full at most meal times. We showed up and were given two cards and asked to wait at the bar. There is no system though to getting seated and people who came after us were seated before us. We also weren't given seats across from one another as requested but instead were seated next to one another in a bench seat area which was way too small to squeeze into as it was abutted up on to the wall next to it. Finally, once seated, everyone is so close that every word you utter is within earshot of six other people. Intimate seating for sure....if you want to be intimate with everyone around you. The ordering process is also quite inefficient. In hindsight, as two people, we should of ordered everything on one machine and with one card. Maybe that way the drinks would of come at the same time and thereafter the food. Instead we both used our own tablet and ended up having drinks and food all come at varied times. I was done with mine when my wife's arrived. Same with the burgers. Finally, the food ended up being OK. I've had far better burgers but these weren't necessarily bad. Yet they weren't anything more than mediocre when you take all the competition which has arrived on the scene in Hamburg. The drinks were also OK. Beer is beer but the home made ""drinks"" with creative uses of basil, etc. were a bit ""off"". Nevertheless, we experienced the place and are happy to have seen it but the experience fell flat and we won't be back."
4,"Every time I am in Hamburg I go directly to see main man Peter at Mini-Grill,he makes the World's Best Chicken, no doubt about it. Also the 'gurken salat' (cucumber salad) is excellent and the pommes frites (french fries) are excellent with homemade curry ketchup. Also enjoy very much the original art work from the late great artist Erwin Ross, some of his last work before he was tragically struck down by an automobile. (Erwin painted Beatles logo.svg. Wordmark of The Beatles, originally painted directly on drum by Erwin Ross, Hamburg. Date. 1960) ask Peter when you are in there enjoying the world's best chicken. People actually fight over the chickens sometimes because they can not cook them fast enough, so get there when it's not busy or be patient and wait...it's worth it! Jon Hammond"
3,"This is a pretty local place with good for for a very fair price. The small soup was pretty big and delicious. Everything was fresh. Only thing is that the meat seemed a hit dry, but overall great food."
1,"We went here to get a nice lunch and it was quite of a disappointment.The pizza crust was definitely made from factory and the topping didn't taste fresh. We also got a oven baked potato with sallad and chicken and it was barely warm. I bet this is a great place to get drinks, based on other reviews, but DO NOT com here for the food - you'll regret it!"
4,"This museum was really amazing. It reminded me of the Natural History Museum in NYC, but without the barriers between you and the animals. You could get really close to the preserved animals and it made for a very interesting experience that really gave you a better sense of what the animals are like (you don't realize how big a grizzly is until you stand up next to it)."
4,"Can't tell if the people here are French German or German French! The whole restaurant feel very authentic with a fun sailor vibe. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it seems-aside from the tables in the back there is an upstairs and a patio that they open when there's nice weather. The menu is really extensive and it was hard to decide what to order!We ordered table cider, the savory crepe with the poached pear and the chefs special, which was a crepe with a specialty sausage, mushrooms and salad.The table cider came in a cute mug and was delicious. The pear!!! Was!!! Spectacular!!!! The savory sweet flavors really hit the spot. This was a second dinner of sorts so if we hadn't been so full, we would have ordered a sweet crepe. I just admired from afar!!"
1,"It is sushi and Asian fusion in Germany.  Do I need to say much more?  One of my Hamburg colleagues planned an outing for us here for dinner.  It's clubby atmosphere with the loud music, red and mod decor will get you in the mood for a raging good time.  However, I was jetlagged with well over 24 hours of no sleep.  The menu blended sushi, other Japanese dishes and Thai food.  I didn't want to seem like the pooper, so I let the group go with what they wanted.  Also, I am very skeptical of Asian restaurants abroad.  So we shared one of the sushi boat assortments and an assortment of skewers.  Rolls and skewers were average, lots covered in sauce.  I'm alway skeptical when rolls and everything are drenched in sauce.  The fried tuna one was a little on the fishy side.  Our waiter was trying to offer some recommendations but I felt that he wasn't too helpful to help indecisive first timers.  We ended up paying about 27 Euro each to share the two appetizers platter and our respective drinks.I'd say hunt around for better Asian food elsewhere."
3,Love this place. Love the wall paper. Love the free mini Lucky Strike matches. Love the music. Came here once a bit too early I think about 11pm (although that's quite late for an English person!) and it was really quiet and my boyfriend fell asleep But when this place is packed it's definitely one of the best places in the city to go.
3,"Cute place for a breakfast, lunch or dinner... Very friendly associates"
1,Although their sign says Thai and Vietnamese food I didn't see much Vietnamese on the menu. I had the Penang Curry which was quite nice and a beer. The food was ok and plentiful but the table and the condiments on it were a bit greasy. I'm not really precious but it felt a bit grotty. I prefer my restaurants to be cleaner.
4,"Such an amazing place. We had the tuna steak with green peppercorn sauce and the assorted fish assortment in white wine & tomato sauce off of the specialty menu. Everything was absolutely sublime, and they helpfully brought more bread to help soak up the left over sauces. The potatoes that came with the tuna were also unusually good, as though rosemary went into them before they were fried. A fairly unforgettable experience for these weary travelers."
4,"Very good restaurant, a little price for a tasty food. Ask their noodles if you don't have too much ideas."
4,"Really good dürum- I Stan this bitch. It was juicy, dry everything u would want in a durum."
4,"The food is very fresh at a really good price. But the best part is the service. Good wines, clean and easy to get there.It is better to make reservations because the place is very small.Everybody is very friendly. Highly recommended."
4,Nice restaurant!!! The food is delicious and cheap.
4,Spaghetti Eis is da best. Also the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had.
4,"全汉堡最好吃的pho！ Best beef pho in Hamburg. Came at dinner time, the place is crowded with hipsters. The food was really really great, especially the soup in the pho. It has the rich flavor of beef, or in Chinese ""鲜"". I tried ice green tea this time, it is just ok, but my friends ordered lime ginger soda, she said it was good. Maybe try some other drinks next time."
2,"Its is a small Thai/asia restaurant in my hometown back in hamburg, Germany.I was here before long before i used type/yelp. It is constantly ok'ish.It is not outstanding food but it is also not bad.This time i had fried wantan and i was really disappointed, a specialty in Germany is that the fried wantan are filled (that different to the us when i ask even my favourite Chinese spot, they never are able to make filled wantan, it don't really get why, cause in the WanTan soup they always use filled ones) - but back to my experience with Hee Yang, i was disappointed cause the wantan have been filled but with just a very, very small amount of meat. As main course i had chicken sweet and sour. It was a small portion (I was here for Dinner). The sauce was ok not outstanding and chicken just some pieces. On the positive side it was made with fresh ingredients like gherkins, carrots and pineapple. But as said not a lot, even the rice was a small portion. i was still hungry so that i had to order another starter so i had the satay chicken kebabs. The peanut sauce and the skewers have been very good. and i was happy that i ended with the kebabs. Overall ok, but for the small portion and mediocre wantan i have to reduce 2 stars. Just another point on the positiv side: everything (except the fisch sauce) is without MSGs. Immer wenn ich nach Hamburg zu Besuch komme in meine Heimatstadt ist ein Besuch in der Langen Reihe Pflicht. Ich war schon ein paar mal mittags bei HeeYang, diesmal war es 22:30 und ich war noch hungrig. So endete ich bei Yang. Ich bestellte mir WanTan, das besondere in Deutschland gegenüber der USA wo ich jetzt lebe ist das man hier die WanTan füllt mit Schweinehack, oder manchmal auch mit Scampis. Das wurde auch hier gemacht, aber so dünn und wenig das ich es erst gar nicht gesehen habe, geschweige denn geschmeckt :(.Nun weiter zum Hauptgang was ein knusprigen Huhn süß sauer war. Auch hier wiederholte sich eine übersichtliche Portion. Ich möchte beinahe sagen ich hatte gefühlte 10kleine Stücke Hühnchen. Die Soße war ok, mir gefiel das man merken konnte es wurde mit frischen Zutaten wie Gurken, Karotten und Ananas gearbeitet. Aber selbst diese Zutaten waren spärlich auf dem Teller verteilt. Die Soße selber war wirklich ok für meinen Geschmack, da hatte ich wesentlich bessere (aber auch wesentlich schlechtere). Nun sei es drum, ich war noch hungrig und habe dann die Satay Spiesse bestellt. Die waren dann 100% lecker und ich war froh das dies mein Abschluss war denn bei der Soße hätte ich am liebsten den Teller abgeleckt. Das Hähnchenfleisch war super zart und saftig perfekt gegart und eben einfach lecker. Die Spiesse waren mit Hähnchen und abwechselnd immer ein Stück Frühlingszwiebel gesteckt. Wenn ich wieder hingehe werde ich sicherlich drei oder viermal die Spiesse bestellten und woanders meinen Hauptgang holen. Die waren es wirklich wert. Dennoch am Ende des Tages muss ich sagen zwei Sterne gehen an den Geiz auf dem Teller verloren."
4,"My favorite cafe in Hamburg. Great coffee, many different brewing methods and types of filtered coffee. I love how they serve them. I even bought a few of their cups. Very spacious with view of the canal, friendly staff, but the food is hands down the best thing about this place. Everything I ordered is very well presented and tastes delicious!! Pouched eggs with avocado, paninis, açai bowl, waffles, especially the apple-basil compote!! And if you are lucky, you will see their cute french bulldog hanging out in the corner."
3,"Not the best quality of food, great deal nonetheless. For €4,50 you can get a jumbo Döner. If you're looking for good, fast, cheap food. I would go to Batman the Restaurant."
4,"Best Döner in Town! The service is great, always smiling faces, delicious meat and chicken döner, big portions.Döner Tüte is highly recommended!;)They have also great snacks like börek..."
2,"A pretty standard Indian place. It's nothing extraordinary but is part of the Schanze scene and like most places has seating outside on the sidewalk. I found service to be quite disinterested and not fast which started annoying us after a while. Food on the other hand was good and the two times I've eaten there, it was good. Unfortunately I find that the portions are quite small and they skimp on meat if you order it. If you're just looking to sit outside and have a couple beers, this place is fine. If you want great Indian food, there's other places that are better."
4,"Rating this place and giving it 5 stars is like shooting fish in a barrel.  It's the best place in Hamburg to hang, and luckily it's 10 minutes from me mum's house.  I always say ""I'm heading down to Strandperle"", but in reality I've never hung out at Strandperle, always at Ahoi, because it's breezier, and they have a decent weizenbier on tap.  I've been there in January, when it's just barely above freezing, and all the outdoor tables are full (Hamburgians's love to soak up rays on sunny days;  though if it's over 80 degrees, it tends to be less crowded because they find the heat a bit intolerable).The pizza is pretty good, but I usually just get the tap weissbier.   Getting a table outside in the shade can require some eagle-eyed patience, but you can pretty much always find a place in the sun, or take your drink 25 feet and sit on the sand.Far and away the best way to get there, if you mum doesn't live just up the hill,  is to take the ferry boat (#61 or #62), from Landungsbrucken or the Fischmarkt to Neumühlen/Övelgönne then walk west along the river.  It's part of the public transportation system, so you can travel on the ferry with your day pass,  or you can buy a ticket in the boat from a machine.  If you're up for a swim, there is a public indoor/outdoor swimming pool which is an 8-minute walk from the end stop on the ferry line, Finkenwerder.  (You can also actually swim in the river, off to the left from Ahoi/Strandperle, but the water is kinda brown.)  Then, after a swim, Ahoi/Strandperle is the perfect spot for some après -swim suds."
3,"We went here once for breakfast and in my opinion it is a very good price for the tasty breakfast. Another time I tried the pizza, it was a little small in my opinion. The staff was very nice and helpful. One downside was that the street was a bit noisy."
0,"Coffee time should be a time to relax, reflect, chat or read (it helps if you're enjoying a good coffee too!)Balzundbalz doesn't seem to buy into. Common sense seems in short supply here! Today's visit was my worst experience in a cafe. Ever.I ordered from a nice gentleman and told him we were outside (regretfully I also left a 20% tip!) Then we ordered a water for our son. However, just as our drinks were being prepared we were told by a member of staff that we had to move the the pushchair (although our son was still in it, not wanting to be held!) onto a grass verge across from the footpath and the cycle path! The reason being...it was an obstruction. There was enough space on the footpath for a pedestrian or push chair to pass and also the cycle lane was not obstructed. As another customer that left shortly afterwards said: ""I don't see what the problem is! There's plenty of room!"" Furthermore, the design agency next door were sat outside on benches and tables having lunch - this was in a narrow part of the street and would cause more of an obstruction to pedestrians. A little common sense could go a long way - if we were politely seated elsewhere (we had taken up position well in advance to buying out drinks funnily enough!), dealt with in a courteous manner, or even apologized to over the rude brashness of the staff member I wouldn't take issue. If you would like your coffee served with a slice of over zealous officiousness then this is a perfect cafe! Fine, you don't want to lose your right to outdoor seating, it's easy to quote: ""we need to keep a distance of 1,5m from a cycle lane"", rather than deal with improving the customer experience. On the other hand, if you would like a coffee, peace, tranquility and good service - move along. There are many parents and babies in Eppendorf and this cafe is certainly not baby friendly (it's not friendly full-stop!) so I'd strongly advise heading to one of the other many cafes nearby. With regards the coffee...the cappuccino was all milk and no coffee and the long black was ""meh"" at best. It's a shame that the service and coffee aren't what you come to expect; the location is fantastic."
4,"Another cozy bar on schanze, where you can hang out any day of the week and drink some nice cocktails or whatever you prefer."
2,"A quick and easy walk from the Miniature Wonderland, this side street cafe has a nice outdoor seating area and the service was very good. The pizza was tasty as was the spaghetti bolognese.  Not a long wait at all to get the food but the beer was kept cold and full while we did wait!"
3,"The best burgers in town! I love me a cheeseburger on most occasions, but save my visits to fast food joints as last resorts. Somewhere, between 1eu McDonald's burgers and 7eu beef monsters from Oma's are the Jim Block burgers - fresh, affordable, quick and really really tasty - on a a plate with a knife and fork. A burger will set you back between 3-5 euros, depending on the size (regular vs. ""Jim Block burger"" or something of the sort). Expect to stand in line quite a bit during the evenings, and try to get one of your party to physically reserve seats for you while you're ordering, otherwise you'll be eating standing up. Well recommended for a quick dinner minus the junkfood guilt."
3,"good, solid Chinese food -- if you're hungry, you'll be happy you came to this great neighbourhood find.the restaurant itself is unassuming; it's big enough but not fancy.  service was friendly and quick when asked for, and the food came out fresh and fast. the vegetables were delicious, and all the meats we had were done tenderly and flavorfully.  prices are fair, and you do get a good portion.  as with most Chinese restaurants, the menu is designed for family-style eating  there is also a lunch menu that is served from 11am-5pm.my peeps come from Shanghai, so i never got my tastebuds trained for Sichuan-style spicy, so much of this menu was a bit off-limits to me.  however, there are plenty of non-spicy options and i can say they are all yummy!  the restaurant is off of the main street Eiffestrasse, behind a car rental place."
4,It is a pretty friendly environment with lots of options of coffee and cake-desert mixtures. Even dough there are available place for sitting around 50-70 people you will be in need of waiting a bit(aprox.5-15 min). I tried their late- macchiato - delicious -made of some kind of Rwanda origin beans. Hint: If you sit in those bar chairs a bit later your back hurts so try to get a table sitting option. Pretty good location btw- if you couldnt find anywhere at schanze or before going there after Sternschanze subway station have a break here.Highly recommended.
3,Always go here when in hamburg. It's god great schnitzel which is always good. Nice location overlooking the canal in central hamburg. Only issue with the place is the service is painfully slow. Been here 3 times now and every time had to ask a few times for a beer or a table or a menu. They seem to be always busy so service is not something they have dealt with. Great place otherwise though and always a good atmosphere.
4,"My dad took me to his favorite restaurant where he feels like home the food is always consistent and real delicious. The service in incredible nice and are super friendly The restaurant is clean and has a fun vibe My dad got a noodle dish and he loved it, my dish was super yummy (liver and fresh mashed potatoes with applesauce .personally like the weekly flyer they hand out so you know the dishes  daily.The service is super nice and friendly And the owner is very nice and helpful"
3,"This was the first place I ate on my my first day working at Qype. It's also now just across the square from where I now live.The food they serve is really really delicious and extremely good value.The decor and service is a little random, however that's all forgiven by delicious food that you can eat with a clear conscience."
3,"It's too bad that I'm not a big fan of Absinthe (it's the alcohol content and the aniseed that kill it for me), otherwise I'd probably make this place a second home. There's something mysterious and magical about the Absinth Bar, which reminds me of my teenage years, when we'd all dress up in black and run around the streets at night, hopping from bar to bar and listening to Within Temptation (I'm losing points for this, aren't I). The couple that runs this place are part of what makes this place a must-visit. The guy who served our table was extremely knowledgeable about Absinthe and it's sorts. It was obvious that this place was built around their passion for the drink and it's culture. The establishment itself is small, dimly lit and, well, green. It reminded me a bit of a bar you'd find in Narnia, after passing through the closet. I didn't have any Absinthe, but my friends did - the prices didn't seem like they'd break the bank, but they weren't entirely cheap, either. To be honest, if I would have ordered some Absinthe, I'd probably prefer to pay an extra few euros and get a quality drink. I'm following the age-old beer rule here: the cheaper the beer, the bigger the hangover. Perhaps I'll order a drink during my next visit, since it seems the folks who run the place will probably be able to suggest an Absinthe which my body won't, err, reject. I will, however, take a star off the rating for the seating arrangements in the bar. They are somewhat uncomfortable (hard wooden bench-type arrangements) and I'd like to think that a good Absinthe is at least 40% general atmosphere. Recommended to folks who'd like to try something different for a change."
4,This place never fails to deliver amazing authentic Indian food. Great samosas. The dip that comes with the samosas are delicious. Their food has just the right amount of spice. Good portions with very reasonable prices.
4,Must see place in Hamburg! I have been here many years ago when I was little and I loved it and now grow up I saw how even more amazing this is. They are making more and more new exibitions and you dont need to be child to enjoy the plesure of this place ;)
3,"Met a good friend here for a coffee. It was Sunday and packed and rightly so! The coffee was very good and the atmosphere was very nice, not quite what I expected from the area. I did not try any of their food offerings, but the nice man next to me seemed to truly enjoy his chocolate cake. I also noticed that they had a Brunch Bar out, and that families were helping themselves to the emptying selection (it was after 13:00). Looking forward to my next time back! Check it out if you are in the area!"
1,"I don't know why this place gets such high ratings. Honestly, the guy behind the bar was totally unfriendly, I didn't feel welcome at all and he didn't use pleases or thank yous or anything like that, he didn't even point out that the kumpir on top of the counter was mine, until I asked him. Apart from the fact the service sucks, the place was a mess as well, the guys behind the bar just seemed more interested in listening to their music than keeping the place clean. The food was okay, I have to be honest, but it was expensive at nearly 4 Eur, where there are better bargains to be had only a few metres down the road to the right at Falafelstern, where you get great service and a huge falafel for only 3,50 Eur.I am sure the people behind the bar are not the owners, owners know how hard it is to earn a buck and it's a shame I have to resort to writing a review like this, the date I went was Sunday 9 June 2013 at 5pm. Maybe if the owner reads this he knows who was on shift that day and can fire them."
3,"It seemed only fitting, being Australian and all, to go to the 'Down Under' bar to watch Deutschland Vs Australia in the Football. I must admit, I was a little scared. I was anticipating a horribly tacky, over-done museum of typical Aussie icons plastered on the walls with a sound track of Steve Urwin saying ""Crikey"" over and over in the background. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that although there were typical Aussie icons present like digeridoos and kangaroo signs, it didn't feel over done. It didn't feel like 'home' but it felt good. I think the menu was comical rather than accurate...I don't actually think in reality there are too many typical Australian dishes. But they did a great job to have kangaroo on the menu. Please eat them- they are a pest! I had a chicken burger that came in a baguette. Once again, I don't know how Australian that is but who cares? It tasted good! We had friendly service from the bar staff and waitresses which IS typically Australian and to me, more important. It was a great atmosphere to watch the game in. Australians and Germans together got to witness the thrashing. All in all, a great night."
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner here. My galette was stuffed with prosciutto, mushrooms and cheese - you really can't beat that! It was very tasty. My husband did not enjoy his galette because he mistakenly thought ""andouille"" was the New Orleans style spicy sausage. Let's just say this version had too many innards, not enough spice and a funky a metallic scent. He couldn't finish it, but I do not blame the restaurant since it was our ignorance.I recommend reservations or else you might not get a table. We did not have a reservation and they sat us, but advised our time would be limited until the reserved party arrived.Gluten free dining notes: 100% buckwheat crêpes are gluten free, and they will gladly substitute them for the wheat dessert options!"
4,Their cappuccinos are great. TheIr espresso is medium to dark roast which suits my personal preference. No big bubbles on the foam and the milk was heated to the right temperature. The decoration is great and overall the place has a really nice vibe to it.
1,"Ok pasta/ pizza to a ok price and friendly staff. That's what you get, if you get in. Usually long que and even if you book a table you have to wait an hour or more to get in."
2,"We finally tried Jim Block after a year of living in Hamburg. The verdict? As the 3 stars indicate, it was ok--nothing more or less than what I expected I guess. Jim Block burgers are slightly better than McDonalds or Burger King in flavor, but are double in price. The bread used is that familiar super soft, highly processed looking bun that, frankly, isn't made to hold much in between them. This makes JB burgers a fork and knife kind of a meal. The burger patty looks mass-produced, was dry and highly seasoned, probably because of the lack of flavor in the actual meat. The fries tasted very much like McDonalds fries. Ketchup and mayo are 40 cents each and instead of serving the burger in a wrapper, it comes on a plate. I ordered the JB Champignon while my hubby ordered the JB BBQ. Both had good combinations of ingredients, but no matter what you put in it, you can hide that subpar meat. In conclusion, I can see the appeal, but I won't be coming back, at least not on my own volition."
4,"One of the best tourist destinations in Hamburg.  Having visited before it was the reason we chose to come back to Hamburg again.  No two visits are the same.Make sure to reserve your entry time online to avoid long delays at your arrival.Take your time at each display to look for hidden surprises.  Look for videos on YouTube to get your plan laid out for the day, and plan to spend the day here.  The airport alone is worth several hours."
3,"Came for a late Sunday afternoon lunch after walking around the area. I had no prior knowledge of Tiefenthal and therefore no expectations as my husband picked the spot. They serve breakfast until 4pm on Sunday so I was excited that we arrived at 3:30. I ordered the Eimsbütteler breakfast with the extra 3 scrambled eggs. It's quite a bit of food: 3 eggs, toast, salami, ham, 2 kinds of cheese, 2 rolls, croissant, butter & jam. The food was good - eggs a little dry and croissant was nothing to write home about but I think it all cost 12 euros. We were recently in Paris for a weekend and this kind of breakfast would easily go for 30. The salami and ham were quite good. Service was excellent, space was clean and quiet. My husband and his mom both had the Wienerschnitzel and we all agreed it was pretty good, until we realized they cost 20 euros each! Holy overpriced! We also tried the cheesecake and apricot cake. Neither were very good - not a lot of flavor and dry. I would 100% return for weekend breakfast if I'm in the area."
0,"If you live near the Schanze and are on a budget, you'll know La Sepia. Likely you've eaten there more than once; I certainly have. I've had acceptable dining experiences there (meaning nothing appalling), but mostly, the quality is mediocre or just a cut below. The service, as mentioned elsewhere, is slow, not attentive, and sometimes just plain rude. To sum up: if it's about the money, you might do all right. But if you can afford it--or if quality is important to you--go somewhere else."
4,"Absinth bar is back! Hurrah! It was always one of the best and most unique bars in Hamburg and now after a year away it has returned bigger and better than ever! If you're familiar with it's old location this is literally more of the same. ""More"" in that it's much bigger, but it still retains the charm it used to have. With the increased space it seems that they're already attracting more customers, so the place is full most nights. One minor problem in these cold winter nights is that they seriously need to fix the door to make it close itself automatically. Trust me, after 10 minutes of sitting in there on a cold night you'll understand! My review of the old Absinth bar: We were on the way home from Omas. We were going to show our friend around the best bars in the schanze, but then we noticed the Absinth bar. We actually walked past, but then while discussing it briefly, we thought ""hey, why not"" and went back. The place is tiny, but really well decorated with a beautiful bar full of every kind of Absinth there is. The walls have plaster strategically removed in patches to give it a pseudo-shambolic feel. Not knowing one Absinth from the next we asked for some ordering advice. We were asked do you like it bitter? Do you like it sweet? Bottles were brought to the table and opened for us to sniff. I do wonder whether the service is always so great, because we were the only four people in there! Anyway, for us the service was great. Our chosen drinks were brought on silver plates, with silver spoons holding an absinth dowsed sugar cube. The owner then set alight each cube for us, and explained how to drink our drinks - for our second round there were different instructions for different absinths. All in all a very unique experience, and surprisingly relaxing and tasty."
2,"This place is odd to visit as an Englishman. It reminds you that there are many brands of 'Germany' in GermanyIt's a great big bavarian themed beer hall  complete with beer wenches, Steins and oompah bandA race to get get full to the gills with masses or beer, German food then loudly sing well known German songs.When I was there, I joined two of the waiting staff as we watched a little mouse scuttle between two tables and the bar to run behind one of the service tables. They looked at each other and went about their business. So not a place to impress anyone, but as the Hofbrauhaus in Hamburg it does what it says on the tin. I'd come again to watch Football or for a stag do, but that's about it."
0,"Sadly, this place is a poor representative of Hamburg and the German people.  We came here with our daughter and her boyfriend, who is studying in Hamburg,  and they would not serve us.  They told they did not have space, which is fine. (Even though it appeared several tables open).  When we asked how long of a wait for a table, she said,"" we don't have any space for you.""  All four of us, including our daughter's german speaking boyfriend, agreed the message was rude and because we were Americans.  Warning- if you are an American visiting Hamburg, don't come here.   What I would like to tell the server who was so rude. Please come to Southern California in the USA and enjoy our beautiful beaches. We promise to treat you better than you chose to treat us."
4,"Best Indian food I've had in Hamburg thus far. Went here on an impulse with coworkers for lunch. Little hole in the wall place with amazing food at incredibly low prices. We shared an appetizer of veggie samosas. Love the way it was plated with a variety of dips at all degrees of heat from none to more than some. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Thali, it contained a moderate hint of heat which was enjoyable. My dish came with chicken, rice, yoghurt, a mini salad, bean/legume side, and naan. It was hard to believe all this was just €5.50. After seeing my coworker's plate of Chili Chicken Thali, I think I will have to try that next time to test just how spicy it might be."
3,"After a team building event nearby our whole team from all of our company's different offices enjoyed dinner at Bullerei.  I was told by one of my colleagues that lives in Hamburg that this is owned by a famous local chef and is a hipster restaurant.  The atmosphere is farm hipster sheik.  Since we were a big group we had a set pre fixe menu.  They were very kind to ask us if there's anything we are allergic to or strongly dislike and I told them a few of mine.A delightful amuse bouche was brought out to us before the handful of appetizers.  Everything was served family style.  A hunk of glorious burrata was served and steak tartare for appetizers.  I love medium rare beef but just can't get myself to eat tartare; I heard it was excellent though.  The burrata was nice and creamy and served with plump tomatoes and arugula.  I've heard that seafood is huge in Hamburg, and for the second dinner in a row, I was presented with huge head on prawns.  For veggies they gave us a nicely dressed salad with the right amount of dressing.  They also served us corn on the cobs with a holder.  Corn was average.  We also ordered a few bottles of Sauvingon Blanc which was light and sweet enough for my picky palette.  Next up were the entrees which were hunks of beef and some salmon.  I am super picky with fish so I went for the beef.  It was a bit fatty but the pieces I got were perfectly mid rare.  It could have used more seasoning but they also gave us a few sauces to use.  Also accompanying our protein were delicious plates of asparagus and roasted potato slices.  Gotta have your veggies and carbs! I was already stuffed, but dessert was up next, and I'm always a sucker for dessert.  They gave us various bowls of fruit mousse, a cream mousse topped with fruit, chocolate mousse, and a huge bowl of scoops of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice creams.  We were a group of about 12 women and for us it was served family style, so not sure about what others mentioned about micro portions but we had a ton of leftovers to bring to the office the next day.  I feel like it's most of Europe though, with long leisurely dinners (we got here around 8ish and left around 11).  Service was attentive and the food was good, though my favorites were the steak, veggies, and dessert.  Everything was fairly average, and I don't think there's really an area of Europe that's really known for steak unlike areas of the US.  Everyone says it's a hipster place, yes, but the area is a hipster neighborhood too.  It's a bit of a trek from our office, but if you're in the area, I'd recommend it.  I'd say 3.5ish rounded up."
1,"Why does this have such great reviews?- great location (across the street of Hauptbahnhof)- people talk about this positively- hyped-----------------------------------------------------------------However I ate here I think 3 times. But always picked by my friends.Most positiv reviews came from non-asians I guess (of course I didn't check all reviews but I'm sure haha). It's like you are crazy about chinese beer, because you've never tried german beer hahahahahaha.People love Quan do because they've never tried the real good vietnamese pho.For 6,90€ or something the pho (vietnamese noodle soup) is way to small and you don't get side dishes here. And the soup is way to flavorless, not intense enought tho.YOU WANNA TRY REAL GOOD PHO? . . . GO TO VIETNAM!!! hahaha I'm joking.No there are better places in Hamburg then here. Don't waste your money.-----------------------------------------------------------------GOLDEN RULE:Always go to a pho place where you only see asians, because they know what's good.i.e. Always go to Spanish restaurants, where you only see spanish people.Always go to Indian restaurants, where you only see indians. You get the point.It's the same. You don't wanna get fake food, you wanna get the real deal. So you better start asking asians haha."
4,"Ooooohhh how I love this place!! Great decor inside with a very cruisy and relaxing atmosphere. The coffee is good, but not brilliant, however they have the best ever toasted cheese and tomato sandwiches!!! The Gloria burger is also a winner. Food is cheap as chips and quite substantial servingsso go on an empty stomach! The beer selection is great and the staff are attentative and really friendly. On a cold winter sunday, I could stay at Gloria all day..."
3,"Christiansen's has a reputation of one of the best cocktail bars in Hamburg, where bartenders take seriously (meaning participating and winning bartender competitions) mixing all sorts of concoctions.So I thought it will be very trendy place, full of action, hot people, noise, bartenders shaking/mixing/stirring  you've got the picture. But no, very quiet, cool, relaxing place. They have all sorts of drinks of course and the list of cocktails is unbelivable. On Monday you can get free massage, which I absolutely have to try next time!"
4,"The falafel wraps here are SO GOOD! I really like how they use real whole vegetable toppings in their wraps instead of stuffing it with cold cabbage or lettuce. Aaaand you can also watch them prepare/cook the falafel balls in front of you, so you know they're fresh. For EUR3,50 you really can't get a better deal. Five stars and two thumbs up!"
4,"update: Kentucky Fried Chicken eat your heart out! This is where the fast-food chicken is in Hamburg. So I finally tried the chicken and it was great. It was also a surprisingly manageable portion, which makes a nice change from a lot of the fast food around. The sign outside says ""Best Chicken in Hamburg since 1966"" and they might not be too far wrong.I really want to try the half-chicken and chips, as it's supposed to be one of the best in Hamburg, however when I went the other week they'd already sold out! Anyway I had schnitzel with hausgemacht pfeffer sauce and it was damn nice. I'll be back to try the chicken one of these days!"
2,"This is a snug, quaint restaurant that serves traditional food from Swabia, a region in south Germany, for lunch and dinner. It's cozy with a peaceful ambiance and specializes in Spätzle (Swabian soft pasta) and Maultaschen (Swabian dumpling). There are many vegetarian and vegan options, as well as an English menu.I tried cheese Spätzle with caramelized onions, sheep's cheese, and smoked tofu (all Spätzle is served with a basic side salad) and Maultaschen stuffed with minced meat and spinach. Both dishes were very fresh tasting with seemingly high quality ingredients and nice preparation. However, I was disappointed as I didn't find either lived up to the mostly outstanding reviews this place has. I thought both were good, but I didn't think either was particularly flavorful. I wouldn't go here expecting an outstanding tasting meal, but nonetheless it's a nice little restaurant to try some authentic food."
3,"I daresay I liked this little restaurant as much as any bistro I ate at while visiting Paris!Le Plat du Jour has a traditional fixed course French menu dinner setup - 30 euros to pick one from each of three courses. There is one ""plat du jour"" representing the nightly special you can elect for your entree.I started with a salad but my co-diners got the pate. I have to admit I was a little food envious looking at their plates! The mains were all very nice - our table had a fish, some sort of very rich looking liver dish, and the ""plat du jour"" involving chicken drumsticks. All with requisite amounts of butter and French sauce, right in the middle of Hamburg."
4,Delicious! The jumbo portion is too much for one person. The prices are right and the curry sauce they use is amazing. This place has probably the best currywurst I've ever eaten. Beats many places in Berlin out of the water.
4,"Ein super tolles Event, kann ich nur empfehlen!! macht spaß und man lernt sich besser im dunkeln zu verständigen."
4,"Awesome vegan Cafe that serves very yummy and interesting dishes. Not just healthy but also tasty.Only bummer: They only accept cash, so come prepared.Had the quiche with a salad and this definitely feds you up.Highly recommended, even if you're not a vegan ;)"
4,"One of the better meals we had while in Hamburg.  The giant white asparagus was in season and was delicious.  Food was presented in a simple clean elegant manner, and more importantly, everyone liked their meal.  Service was attentive as well."
3,"The ice cream shop ""Eiskantine"" offers a small choice of ice cream flavors. The flavors include very common flavors like vanilla and chocolate as well as special flavors like chocolate-mint. The ice cream tasted very good. The shop has its own interesting style and the staff is very nice."
3,"Nice little park between Hoheluft-Ost and Harvesthude. There's lots of space to picnic here on a sunny afternoon, benches to lay on and enjoy the sun and plenty of room to play ball and barbeque. The park itself is circular, so taking walks around the park lead you straight where you started off :)"
2,Nice bar at the beginning of the Reeperbahn between Operettenhaus and Schmidt's Tivoli Theater. Perfect place to start the evening or have a chilled evening during the week. It can get very crowded on weekends. The bar has all the usual drinks. There are several djs that play at Hörsaal.
3,"Sit-down service only. I was early for an appointment and stopped in to get a latte macchiato to go. No paper cups = no coffee to go. :-( Too bad. I could imagine picking up a coffee and then strolling around in the park across the street afterwards. Regardless, the place looks extremely cute and was seemingly full for the time of day and time of week. I will come back and try out the food. UPDATE: Had some time this week to relax at a cozy table and enjoy a cup of coffee with the fluffiest milk foam I've seen in a while. It's the end of winter and from where I'm sitting, there's a perfect view of the Antebellum Gossler House up on the hill. This is such a cute place. Antiques carefully selected give this place real charm and character and warmth. While enjoying the dusk and eavesdropping to whispered conversations in the next room, I made my next happy discovery: the best cheesecake this side of the Atlantic - moist, like those in the US, without being too heavy."
3,Öld style Environment with well built antique! Little bit expensive but quality ! Bre
4,"Outdoor seating, great food/soup, nice little sandwiches. Love it!"
3,Hands down Hamburg's currywurst beats Berlin's. The juicy sausage is packed with flavor and has the perfect snap as you bite into it.  Curry powder was flawless and not too overpowering - it was unforgettably mouthwatering and conveniently located in the most charming little city!
3,"3 Euro for a falafel brot (which is actually a wrap). It is hot, tasty, but not the best i had. In Berlin one can find much better falafel joints. This place is an amazing solution for hunger after midnight when most place are closing down. I was afraid a vegan like me would not find  anything at this time, but found this as a great option. The place was full, and there is a cozy sit down tables on a gallery upstairs."
4,"Qrito, Qrito, how I love those burrrrritos.It's no secret... I love Mexican food. When we first moved to Hamburg, I suffered typical withdrawals in the form of hanger, flashbacks and weekly FaceTime calls with my mom that included talking about the beauty that is fresh guacamole.But then a silver lining appeared...One rainy, midsummer day, my job hosted a catered lunch from Qrito. With one bite, the sky cleared and rainbows formed in the sky. Mexican food. Cooked really well.Okay okay, theatrics aside... This place is A+. Definitely check it out.My personal recommendation is the carnitas burrito."
4,I found this Brazilian restaurant by accident and I found it awesome. Very friendly staff and the food super yummy. It's really worth the place :)
4,"What a lovely restaurant. The server/owner was delightful, warm, charming, witty, and welcoming. Phenomenal service. Fantastic chef/owner. Food was outstanding. Perfectly executed. Delicious. Would return in a heartbeat and with great pleasure. Highly recommended!"
3,If you are ever in Hamburg. Don't miss this place! The schnitzel was excellent as well as the potato pancakes Nice atmospheric. Truly enjoyed. C
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining as Ernst wrote. The food is mediocre at best. There is nothing sensational on the menu. Nor is there anything in any way memorable. All fairly standard fare. Sometimes things are good. Sometimes they are off. The place is not consistent. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow. I couldn't even tell what it was. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table."
2,"There certainly is a new wave of ice cream in Germany ... but I wondered why people keep lining up at Eisliebe? Is it that it's 20-30 cents cheaper than at Schmidt's up the road?Eisliebe's few flavours from Amarena to Vanilla are as vanilla as they come, and so is the quality. I actually threw away some of it, it was so bland."
4,Found the Bistro as I was walking around and I am so glad I stopped in as the service was fabulous!! I had the Hambourgeouise tartine and it was amazing!!!
4,"This place is absolutely overflowing with character. Sandwich underneath the tracks, at some point most of the building slumped and settled leaving it all on an angle. The walls are safe, but look like they are about to fall over and are at a significant angle. The floors also are at an angle and depending on where you're sitting you'll find yourself leaning against gravity. You can even put an empty bottle on the table and watch it roll. The food is traditional northern German, with a slightly artistic flair. It was tasty and full of flavor with hearty portions. The burger was recommended by the waiter and was one of the more unique hamburgers that I've tried. It is a very small venue, with ample room outside for seating during summer."
3,so far my favorite coffee place in hamburg! you can choose from two different types of (locally roasted) coffee beans and the barista seemed to know what he's doing. will be back!
4,"This was one of my favorite places while visiting Hamburg. Such a great welcoming vibe: old wooden tables, candles - cozy but not precious. The owner was extremely nice and they have an English menu too which was so nice after struggling to decipher German menus for weeks. I had the chicken burger which was incredible - full of flavor, topped with bacon and all the usual toppings. Highly recommend!  I enjoyed it with a Petit Chablis which I rarely see for sale in the US - definitely not a wine snob approved pairing but it hit the spot. If you're in the area definitely try this spot out!"
3,Great food and very attentive staff. Very good price level. Best to book in advance.
1,"Haven't been able to taste the burger yet because we have been made waiting for 1h 20 minutes as for now. Basically the service ignored us, taking orders from anybody else around us which came AFTER us. Eventually we had to ask for menus. After 1h10m, when we decided to talk to the manager, he only put up a bunch of excuses. I can now count 6 tables that sat after us, ordered, ate, paid and left before we could even see our burgers...Oh and the drinks are room temperature warm.EDIT:Food eventually came and I have to admit it was really good, make sure you try the different homemade sauces and the fries."
0,So you want wine and tapas? Well forget it - your not welcome there if you have that wish. The owner is surprisingly unfriendly and rude and only wants 'real' dinner guests in his tapas hole.
4,"Friendly, Cosy, Delicious.This place is our second home. The staff is super positive, quick and always welcoming. You have got a million choicesfrom breakfast, potatoes over chicken in peanut sauce, wraps. pancakes to Giros. There is always something you are longing for. The fresh joices and cocktails take you to the lost summer AND the place even has SOYA milk for all us lactose intollerant people. Oh and the Martini comes in a martini glass.AND comes at a very good price. I bet James B. would come here if he ever had another case in HamburgMy only suggestion would be to come up with a weekly special, which is not on the menu and could surprise regulars like us!And of course as always the toilette review: they are clean, but a touch of comfort could be added. Some vintage style accessoires or something.I gotta say, it is my favorite place in the Schanze  don't know what we would do without it."
3,"The tour is interesting but only moderately though for young children. The tastig of chocolate you get to do is kept to a minimum but you get to make one bar of chocolate which you can decorate, lots of fun, BUT only for a full priced ticket, not for a child ticket which is totally NOT COOL!"
3,"Good place to get lunch! They seem to have three different meals to select from (not sure if threee different every day) and it's really affordable (3,90 EUR for a ""regular""). Tall costs a bit more, but I am not sure if you need that - I felt stuffed. :) Usually Indian places in Germany don't season the food very much, but this place is different. Pretty nice, especially since this is not a ""real"" restaurant, but a fast food joint."
3,"Are there any beach clubs in the UK? By way of explanation, a beach club is an outdoor bar with a layer of sand across the floor to make it like a beach. Most of these bars are next to rivers or lakes, but not always. Anyway Strand Pauli is the most permanent and generally the closest beach club to the Reeperbahn. The pluses are that the atmosphere is always cool, the seating is good and the view is interesting (so long as you like shipping). The main minus is that the sand is dirty and full of cigarette butts. The beer is kinda expensive, but cheaper than the other beach clubs."
0,"Worst place ever, the most not nice people gathered together and work there, if you wanna ruin your night and evening I totally recommend it."
3,"Great Sushi in a great location. Food was spot on. The day we visited was super hot. It's a bit on the expensive side, so don't be surprised about your check. I definitely would go again. The waitstaff is friendly and easy on the eyes. Thanks guys."
4,"During the winter, I never come here, since it's not really on my way to anywhere and I guess has not really looked so appealing form the outside.But we came here on an impromptu sunny evening and it was really good. Now the warm evenings have arrived, there aren't many better places to while away an evening with friends on the Fleet Insel. Because it gets so busy in this area a lot of the other places seem rushed, too busy and more than a little unfriendly.We had very friendly service from our waitress who spoke English and German without a fuss and they let us stay for as long as we wanted even after they should have closed and gone home. We even were able to enjoy the piano player from the next door Steigenberger Hotel terrace!Very nice, great fun, good chilli and beer. If you are passing, on a nice sunny day or evening, it's highly recommended."
3,"Really cute crepes place with delicious crepes! This place gets really packed sometimes as it may be a little touristy but the crepes quality is great! We walked in over the weekend and managed to grab a table for 2 fairly easily. Seems like if you have a larger group or are coming at peak times, you may want to make a reservation ahead of time.Once we got seated, we started with just 2 cups of espresso. Later on I found out I should have ordered one of the ciders. I did see the table next to us order a bottle of cider and poured it into 2 cute tea cups! Ahhh I should have ordered that! Next time! Ok so we had our espressos which were great! then we ordered our savory crepes and also put in an order for our dessert ones. I don't remember the names of our savory crepes but really everything is really good so just pick one! For the dessert crepes we had the plain sugar with butter and also a nutella crepe. Nutella crepes are always delish but I find it a little to rich for my taste. I enjoyed my simple desert crepe. I really wanted the crepe with sugar and lemon but forgot to order the lemon. It was still really good but yes, I need to come back here! :)Overall it's a great place for an afternoon crepe if you are sightseeing or just want a lighter lunch!"
3,"Excellent metaxa-giro, the fries are great as well"
3,"a very nice italian restaurant.. not only the warmness of the place but also the warmness of the italians running it welcomes at the door. The athmosphare is elite. There are nice huge oil color paintings hanged on the walls which are waiting to be sold. You can see the prices nearby. So the reastaurant is somehow a galery as well. They present the menu on a blackboard writen by chalk bringing to your table. More than one waiter serves at the same time. If you have an italian with you you can get an extra care ;) Food is delicious, prices are... so like a pasta is about 8 euro. You can guess accordingly. Food amount is normal in my standarts. So not a lot considering that i usually can not finish to the end a similar dish. After the main dish you can try a light fruit deserts. or maybe they can invite for it.. hehe.. but a liqueur to finish the evening is a must. i tried sambuca and limoncello. Sambuca is a sweeter lighter version of rak? of turkey or ouzo of greece, made of aniseed. Limoncello is as understood of lemon. again sweet. I recommend here for a nice long dinner."
3,"Great food, drink and cocktails too. great location. a definite improvement on the rather snooty Ratsweinkeller that used to be there."
4,"This place saved our lives after a train from Denmark arrived an hour ahead of schedule. Super friendly staff even at 6 in the morning. Wonderful sandwiches and amazing sweet potato soup with a ginger twist. Oh, and did I mention? Incredibly cheap, 10/10 would come again!"
3,"Even without trying any other dim sum restaurants in Hamburg, I'm pretty sure Mei Moon will be our go-to place for dim sum. The hubby and I stopped in after an afternoon of shopping, so we were famished. It was barely 6pm, so I'd like to think we avoided the dinner crowd. The restaurant, though down a small, alley-like street, was not hard to find. You can't miss the red signage. Mei Moon wouldn't be a true Chinese restaurant if they didn't have a giant menu, and this they did have indeed. We stuck with just the dim sum menu and already that was about 40+ items. We ordered 7 items, all of which were super tasty.My favorites included:- Rice roll with BBQ pork- Shark fin dumplings- Prawn dumpling with leeksProbably one of the best parts about the meal was the chili oil. Seriously. It was spicy as heck and very fragrant. Very different, in a good way, than the chili oil I've had at home in SF.Service was friendly, food came out pretty fast and pricing is pretty on par with dim sum places in SF. We look forward to coming back to try the other non-dim-sum offerings."
0,"Don't expect to get customer service. If you're lucky enough to get customer service, the coffee is great, but we're leaving now after 20 minutes of waiting. Even though the waiter has cleaned the table, he didn't ask what we'd like to drink. Also waving at the other waitress didn't help. So, thanks for nothing. See you never."
4,"My wife and I came to this place because of the words of her friends. We had been going to another burger place in town and wanted to see how this one stacked up. We walked in and we're greeted by one of the owners. He sat us and was extremely pleasant. My wife speaks German but I don't. We sat and one of the owners took our order. The owners both spoke English which made ordering easier for me. The menu is in German, but they do a great job of explaining what is on it. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for our food to come, out come the masterpieces. We bit into them and we're immediately taken by how juicy and tasty they were. The burgers and fries were absolutely perfect !!! The toppings were fantastic, and fresh. Everything was perfect when it came to the food. As for the service, it was also top notch. The owners came around and made sure that everyone was ok and were eager to assist with any request. They went above and beyond what I would expect and am accustomed to. They make sure to take care of their customers. I intended to get their names to add to this review, but I forgot. However, I will be updating because we have found our new burger place in Hamburg. We will be returning customers. Pros : 1. The burgers are fantastic. The meat is tasty and juicy but not oily and greasy. They were cooked to perfection. 2. The fries were also cooked to perfection. Not too greasy. They were prepared just right. 3. They make these awesome cookies and cream milkshakes. They are not too heavy and taste great. And this is coming from someone who doesn't usually drink milkshakes. But these were very very very good. 4. As good as the burgers and everything else was, the service was equally as good if not better. They really take care of their customers. Being from NYC, that is something that doesn't always happen. To see such attention to that service was a pleasant surprise. Cons : (Still trying to think of one). All in all, I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I recommend anyone to check this place out. It's definitely well worth it."
3,"Such a cool find thanks to my awesome hubby who planned a surprise date here :)Free jazz Mondays (the band was great!), fairly priced drinks, chill crowd all inside an old fire boat-it was a lovely night indeed. I highly recommend checking out Das Fueurschiff!"
3,"I tried some of the non-sushi dishes on the menu. There are not that many dishes, but the ones I tried were very tasty and were served pretty quickly as well. The staff was very nice. The decoration is modern and nice. You can definately have a yummy meal at the echtasien even if you are not a Sushi fan."
4,Very nice pub - good food - cosy atmosphere and lovely service!
4,Incredible quality coffee. We ordered coffee on ice with hafermilch. It was deliciously creamy with perfect taste of incredible coffee. Nice modern interior! If you crave good quality coffee - this is your spot! I am not a coffee drinker but this one will make me turn into one
3,"Amazing cute little restaurant. Ordered the meatballs, two different salads, hotdogs and the chocolate dessert. All really fantastic dishes with great flavors. Ambiance is great very Scandinavian with a ton of personality. There's big common tables, chairs, chandeliers and smaller wood tables for more intimates dinners. Overall this is a great place to have pleasant lunch or dinner."
0,"Oh dear. I'd actually like to limit this review to just four words: avoid at any cost. But instead I'll take my duty seriously and explain the reasons for this blunt warning. Well, let's start with the ambience: this place is the epitome of a tourist trap. The (huge) restaurant is supposed to resemble some random South American village, natural stone walls, a fountain and all. Needless to say, the end result is very tacky. Let's take a look at the service now. When I visited there was literally a busload full of tourists waiting to enter, and the waiters treated them rather poorly, probably knowing that they wouldn't or couldn't leave anyway. I just felt for the poor band of folklore musicians supposed to add flair to the place - those seemed to be the only people trying to make a decent job at Panthera Rodizio. And now, finally, for the food itself: we dined á la carte instead of choosing the all you can eat option, mainly because I just wanted to spend as little money as possible at the place. What I got was a surprisingly nice piece of meat, well cooked - but the side orders were a disgrace and more akin to what you'd expect at a (1970's) motorway restaurant. The vegetables were soggy and completely overcooked, while the sauce was quite obviously courtesy of chef Maggi. All things considered, do yourself a favour and go to Block House instead."
4,"Not sure eye-opening experience is the right expression, but it's revealing things to none of us who can see would never experience before. Such as, how is it possible to put up with the fact that darkness is all I'll ever see till the end of my life. The guides are blind people, they are very open, will answer your questions, they make you feel comfortable to be in the dark, hard to believe but true. Definitely on of the best things to experience in Hamburg!"
2,"This place is basically OK if you're up for pizza. I can't complain about the taste and size-wise it's nice and big. I actually managed not to finish mine yesterday which is a rarity for me. I was eating my dinner date's dish along for her though so that's my excuse. I find even at night that place is priced well but everything is very basic. The house wine is not all that good so there goes a star. Further, sitting inside at the front or outside is good but the back room is pretty dreary in my opinion. Finally, while we were there, only one waiter was working and he was busy. Service was very slow although the guy was quite nice. If in the area and up for a pizza, a good place to stop in. I wouldn't hump over here though extra to check this place out. One final positive note: when you pay, you get a shot of either grappa or something sweet. We chose the grappa."
3,"Wonderful place with great service. Enjoyed the fine dining very much and great staff added more value. We had salad, stake, Schnizel and cheese collection with a bottle of fine wine. It was lovely and cozy to watch the first snow for Hamburg. Recommend to go and get ready for a beautiful lake view."
4,"Really cool modern experience. At first I thought all the tech was gimmicky, but I have to say the quality of the food was top notch! Really enjoyed my experience."
4,"I was deeply impressed by the super friendly staff and excellent service. Upon arrival you are greeted by a friendly waiter who takes your jacket and hangs it for you in a separate closet. Even though the bar was packed and they were short by one waiter, they managed to handle the situation in a speedy, friendly and professional way. The drinks were delicious and you can SMOKE! Thanks to the additional ventilation, the air is not too stuffy! Love it! Our waiter Jan was brilliant! He took really good care of us and all the other guests! Another advantage: The bar is open until late!"
0,"Horrible. For food that is nothing special and found exactly the same, but cheaper all over the city. Don't bother here. Service topped off my bad experience. In the confusion of not understanding German. I accidentally took the pommes of the lady in front of me. Realising what I had accidentally done, the chap serving me told me that I would be getting one less sausage and instantly took one off my plate before serving it to me. Wow. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible way to treat a customer."
2,"Perfectly good cafe with a good number of seats, music at an acceptable level and a decent range of drinks on offer. A nice selection of cakes too although the ones we had seemed to have dried out to a degree so maybe we were there just a little bit too late in the afternoon."
2,"We ordered number 25 and 32. The sauce of number 25 was good and the nuggets were ok, but for 11 € it's overpriced and not worth it. The 32 dish was ok. When to skip this place: 1) If you are asian and used to asian food, skip this place. It's a classy germanized asian food 2) This might sound like the loving hut chain you think you know from the US. It's not! None of the dishes are the same. Just the name and logo looks the same 3) the service is not about making you feel welcomed or comfortable. It's about making sure you get your food lol. Feels very chaotic and rushed. Would I come again. Nope. Do I regret coming here. Nope, it's good to know that loving hut doesn't equal loving hut. It's not like McDonald's where you can expect to be able to order a Big Mac."
4,"Although I cannot make myself endorse anything related to tobacco I must admit the charm, kind staff and excellent espresso drinks at D&D saved my morning for a week while visiting Hamburg. Never start smoking!  Just drink coffee and enjoy the atmosphere outside away from second hand smoking :)"
4,"Amazing presentation, delicious food, discreet service and lovely view  always forget how nice it is here!"
1,"I went a Sunday night with a friend. The place is nice and the sofas very comfortable. The service on the other hand was bad. I took a Mojito that was OK. My friend a virgin cocktail, but the fruit wasn't fresh. It was evident that was made from a juice box out of fridge. In addition, we had to pay straight away... It is a pity - very nice place with bad service"
3,"Service was ok  butt the food had great taste and culture its always packedBlond waiter who wiped our table with his hand and told us ""thats how it is in here""Youre awesome keep it like that"
3,"Good service, good goulash and great location. Would recommend! We definitely will be coming back."
1,"Tables were open and not reserved. Very arrogant staff asked us to wait outside in the cold. Some more tables cleared up, we went back in, got asked to wait outside again. Food looked great, but the staff was horrible."
4,"We enjoyed our first lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe Hamburg so much, we came back the next day. It's always fun to see the different memorabilia displayed and the fun music selections. The host, Edwin was so friendly and personable. Our server, Nico was great! He was friendly and gracious. The food was very good too.  It helped make our harbor tour and trip to Germany even more memorable."
4,"I've had mixed grills here and they were very good,  but what sets this place apart (and please don't confuse it with Gazi Antep, which is on the same block)  are both the döner kebab and something most westerners never think of trying,  the işkembe çorbası, also known as 'panzensuppe' or tripe soup.A brief word on the döner kebab (which I get in the dürüm döner form, where the bread wrap is thin like a flour tortilla):  for some reason, it is, for me, the most consistently satisfying rendering of the classic German version of the classic Turkish kebab sandwich.  The combination of meats and veggies and flavorings has always been perfectly balanced.But now for the something remarkable, the işkembe çorbası.  Everywhere else I've had it, and I do mean everywhere,  there is far less meat, and the flavor tends to be way more dishwater.   The işkembe here is loaded with both substance and flavor.  You can get it with garlic, which means a spoonful of a garlic sauce,  and then add red pepper flakes ('urfa biber').  You can also indulge in free veggies (like onions and whole peppers) on the side. Not only is it the best işkembe çorbası you can find,  but this is one of the most delicious and satisfying  soups you'll ever experience.Köz Antep is on a nice, leafy, out of the way street;  it is close to the 'Dom' fun fair;  it is a bit of a walk from public transportation (S-St. Pauli, or the Reeperbahn),  but for me that walk whets the appetite something enormous."
3,"If it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd probably go to Pony Bar pretty often. It's a reasonably priced, cool little bar. Unfortunately it's miles away, and there's about 50 good bars in between it and me :)"
4,"I love this place. Great for a date, for going out with your friends, taking your parents when they are visiting. It is better to reserve!"
3,"Pretty cool concept. Bunch of couches laying around (well, aligned perfectly, actually - It's Germany after all), a few vintage lamps lighting the place and a small bar at the end. Sat down late at night, had a few ciders and a nice convo. This one's called Zöe #2 because the lounge across the street called Zöe #1 and belongs to the same people. They look the same but we chose this one because #2 didn't serve tea (true story). Anyway, chill place to chill, A+"
4,Possibly the best Italian food I've ever eaten. We had the set 3 course menu for EUR39.95  starter of a prawn salad on beetroot carpaccio followed by veal with mushrooms in a truffle sauce. An amazing panna cotta with fruit to finish. To top this we had a table with a great view of the harbour. It's not somewhere I would normally eat but great for a special occasion.
4,"Cheap, cheerful, and even though it was ragingly busy late on a Friday night, the waitresses got us our food hot and all together after only a reasonable wait. Very popular, quite loud, pleasant décor, often packed.Guinness on draft, Duckstein available, and some of the best schnitzel I've had in Germany. My dining companions also felt very happy with the potato skins and the cheeseburger they ate. Absolutely recommended."
3,"Had a lovely dinner at this cozy lakeside restaurant. Really reasonable for pretty sizable portions of delicious dishes. Three of us shared three entrees. We tried the daily special which was a whole white fish of some sort with crispy skin. Then three fish fillets that included what seemed to be salmon, halibut and another meatier white fish lightly fried and served on Dijon mustard sauce. We also tried the famous labskaus dish which looked like raw minced meat. I was alarmed until I realized it was warm and was the color of beets. Everything was served in generous portions with sides of pickles and vegetables and so on. The only thing we didn't care for was the risotto. Very nice service by a lovely host who spoke English. Recommend making a reservation. Good for a date followed by a lakeside stroll. ;)"
4,wie immer sehr fleischig!
3,"Great sushi with perfect size, awesome concept of IPad ordering and friendly staff! All you can eat for 25 Euros = 5 orders of your choice times*10= 50 orders over 150 minutes. The industrial feeling mixed with a Japanese touch goes well together. For the dessert I can recommend the green-tea ice-cream as a perfect end of a great dinner."
3,"This is close to a hidden gem. Tiny fish shop with a fair sized menu. When you place your order, it is immediately cooked so always fresh. Unfortunately this means that the place smells fishy; literally. The food is great though. I had the mixed teller that has several fish and potatoes. Delicious! My friend had the fish and chips. While the fish is definitely lacking, the chips were proper British!"
4,"What a find -- Xeôm greets you with an interior that wants to put you in the middle of a street stall scene in Vietnam without overdoing it. I really wonder how they got the confused, curled wiring of the lighting past a German electrician! :)They serve a very limited menu, which obviously often helps quality.It certainly does so here - authentic, very tasteful, and reasonably priced too. Don't overlook the homemade drinks, but note that some are somewhat sweet, so ask ahead.Brilliant place that fills up quickly despite its location 'around the corner', for good reason!"
2,"Once upon a time their burgers and sweet potato fries were amazing. Now they serve you ketchup in a tiny paper cup, you drink your lemonade from an IKEA glass (used to be jars) and their sweet potato fries don't taste as good anymore. Burgers itself are good for the price offered on the lunch menu. Staff seems to change frequently, though they are always friendly."
3,"Now, this is my kind of coffee bar. Stylish, modern but rustic-chic comfortable and clean. Fairly friendly service, accommodating to our group of 10 (reservation made prior) and quick with the breakfast, coffee and teas. My muesli with yogurt and fresh fruit hit the spot, as did my THREE cappuccinos. I had to restrain myself from eating the potted cheesecake for breakfast, but I so wanted to. The paninis also seem to be a very solid choice. The two larger communal tables are VERY sturdy. In fact a bit hard to get in and out of (as Aaron S mentions), but hey...they surely don't wobble or go uneven! A very nice spot to sit and chat. To read. To enjoy a light lunch or breakfast. Read the paper. Soak in a quick break before you tackle Hamburg. I will definitely return on my next visit. *cash only. There is a cash machine just outside to the right across the street. You'll be able to see it from the front door!"
4,"If you're looking for good Italian food in Hamburg and you happen to be in the Speicherstadt area don't look too far. I really really like how they cook pasta, so far I've eaten here quite a few times and never been disappointed. My tips: spaghetti alla carbonara and gnocchi sardi. I should try their pizza or even salads but this is one of those restaurants where I'm just not able to try too many things because the few I've already tried are amazing. It may seem a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is high so if you keep that in mind I think prices are reasonable. Highly recommended!"
4,"I love this place! This is one of those good friends that just never let you down. The creativity is always inspiring mixing tastes that are truly delightful with beautiful presentation that makes me pause a moment and just take it in. The atmosphere is sophistocated while keeping it very down to Earth. I think anyone would feel comfortable here. I really can't call this place expensive - considering the quality and when you go hereyou know you're getting something good! Check the menu on their website, that way you won't be surprised. :-)"
4,Fresh produce and many environmentally friendly options. Slightly pricier but worth the cost for the high quality.
2,"Had dinner here a few nights ago. Aubergine auflauf was really good, so was the service, but it's a bit crammed and the bare walls make it pretty loud.I don't think you'd be disappointed coming here, but considering it's in a region with a lot of good places I'd look around for another option."
4,"The best baked potato I have eaten. Ever. In my life. And it was cheap too. If i remember correctly it cost something like 3.90 EUR. I highly recommend it to everyone, including people who like me, normally do not like baked potatoes. Me and my friends liked it so much that we went there 3 times in two days!"
4,"This place is a find! Mirco Gattardo and his wife Anja greet you and display their menu on a big chalkboard brought to your table. Creative cooking, fine service, reasonable prices. Wines from Salice, in southwest Italy. We loved Trattoria Salento so much we went there three nights in a row! Highly recommend."
4,"Always wanted to meet Audrey Tautou? Me too, that's why I spend all of my free time loitering around this particular photo booth. It's of the type that uses intensely bright flash, bubbling chemicals, and only prints in black and white - yielding a hilarious result which means you'll be laughing by the third shot, and therefore get something you like! Compare this to the lifeless, soulless, trashy photo-me monopoly in the UK, with an annoying computer woman patronising you into looking stupid, and you'll be glad you came to Germany. I never did meet Amelie, but I will."
4,"A very good place for fresh see food such as lobster, scampi, service is quite good as well because they offer kids the color pencils for drawing during waiting for food."
4,"No doubt, the best burgers in town.After a walk around the Alster lake I decided to have a quick meal.It was about the third time I've been here. For a change I preferred the outside seating. It was a nice day...I asked for the JB Hamburger menu. It was very good, except for the potato chips that where too salty for my taste.I think this restaurant has fair prices.The WC facilities where very clean and the staff where friendly."
3,"Burgerlich had me licking my fingers. Good thing I came in with clean hands.The burgers here are very juicy and flavorful. And with the accoutrement of the housemade sauce, sundried tomato relish, melting cheese, and a pretty generous helping of mayo, you can expect it to get a little bit messy. Being that the burgers come on a tasty and light brioche bun, by default, you know that a brioche bun can't soak up the entirety of this meaty-juicy mess, so it's gonna get on you. The bathroom is upstairs when you're ready to clean up.The ordering system is pretty fun and novel. They've installed pop-up screens at every seat within the restaurant. Choose your burger and customize via a touchscreen. I didn't get too fancy with my cheeseburger, I just added some bacon on it. Side note: the onion rings here are awesome and I don't normally order or care for onion rings. Another really good hamburger in Hamburg that I've experienced as a new Hamburger."
3,"One of my favorite Schwarma places in Hamburg. It's a little small inside (25-35 ppl) but nice and friendly. The workers are friendly, too. I don't eat other things there so I can't say much about that food, but Schwarmas taste perfect The range of food isn't that big, but definitely enough to choose from.The only thing I don't like that much are the toilets. You have to go behind the counter to go downstairs and the cabinets are really small. All in all nice place to go!"
2,"The Bullerei is located in a great location: a red brick building where the former slaughterhouses of Hamburg were located. This restaurant seems to get a lot of fame and attention from its celebrity TV chef Tim Mälzer, who owns it.Service was good and attentive, the food was good, but nothing special, prices are quite high for what you get. They specialize in meat, so that is maybe better, I did not have that since that costs even more.Not a must do but always a can do. The big open space all seats are in is not that cozy and inviting, for my taste.The Bullerei has a separate ""lunch"" / Deli kind of area in the front with a different menu.Will probably be back casually."
2,"Previously the Milk bar and now the sands bar. Weird name for a pub that is nowhere next to a beach! I went there after watching a movie at the close by Cinemaxx. I was there relatively early, around 9 pm, the place was still empty, so we secured places at the bar.The bartender and the waitress were very nice, and friendly.The clientele however is a bit older. The DJ kept on playing weird old music, and when we asked him to pump it up a bit, and play newer songs he refused, claiming that the average age here is around ""60"" (exageration!) and they wouldn't appreciate it. So besides the crappy music, the drinks were ok, large selection, tasty cocktails. a bit less than 10EUR / long drink which is fine!"
4,"If you want authentic and well cooked german cuisine and a delicious in house brewed beer, look no further. This is the place.  Classical german brew house ambiance that at least we love when we are in Germany.  Classical dishes that everyone who has been to Germany recognize. The pumpkin and ginger soup with sesame seeds was real comfort food and would have been even better a cold and rainy autumn evening but was still great this sunny day. Creamy texture and wonderful balance between the pumpkin and ginger.  Since it was chantarelle season (pfifferlinge) they had some nice dishes that highlighted that ingredient. The ""Flammkuche"" wich is sort of a thin crust bread with cheese, bacon, creme fraiche and chantarelles was also supertasty.  Big enough to share and a great deal at 10 €.  The veal wiener schnitzel with fried potatoes was amazing and came (as usual) with a fresh side salad. It was all really really good. My wifes pork knuckle (schweinehaxe) was equally good and she was very happy with it.  This is my new no 1 spot for good german food in Hamburg and i have been there +15 times and tried a lot af restaurants."
4,"Can't believe I am the first one to write a review on this world-class museum! International Maritime Museum in Hamburg has information on absolutely everything related to maritime history of the world: from Vikings to Jacques-Yves Cousteau. The museum was opened in summer 2008 as a home to the biggest in the world private maritime collection. And believe me, this collection is enormous: 10 storeys filled with boat models, sea maps, navy uniforms, weapons, mini boat models and much much more. In fact it is so overwhelming, that I could hardly manage the last storey. Information provided on English as well, there are a lot of 'interaction points' so that you don't get bored. The entry is not cheap but it's so worth it. In two words: highly recommended!"
4,"I can't say enough about this place! We had lunch there yesterday and had to go back again today!  The waiters were super friendly and spoke multiple languages. Our waiter spoke German, Italian, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The food is seriously better than a lot of the food I had in Italy!  The bruschetta, burrata, and the pizza with prosciutto and parmigiano was amazing!  They do have some funky dishes that were equally delicious if you like that sort of thing. It is very small and a bit dark inside. Sitting outside is definitely the best, but it does get packed. I would recommend going at like 12 for lunch or 6 for dinner to beat the crowds.  If you want Italian in Hamburg, this is the place to go!!"
4,"We had a wonderful meal here. Great food, ambiance and service. You have to try the tartares.  We enjoyed the meat tartares, and the tuna tartare may have been better.  I'm not sure that I've had a truly delicious steak in Europe before, but I had it tonight. We split the dry aged European T-bone and it was superb. Also, sides and sauces are included so this restaurant is expensive but not as expensive as it could be."
0,"Watch out, they close at random times. After a long slog through the cold and rain, we walked through their front door and were told they're closing at 9:30, even though they normally close at 11. No explanation was given. It was only 9:20 when we got there, but they refused to seat us anyways. I was really looking forward to eating here, so their complete lack of consideration really pissed me off. In spite of their good reviews, they're not worth it."
4,"Stopped by for a quick takeout order today. Super friendly, polite, and clean place. I ordered the dürum and as always it was tasty. Definitely recommend this spot for lunch."
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90.Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel.Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
4,"Trüffelschwein is a restaurant that is well deserving of its Michelin star (I personally would give it two), and we have now been feeling extra lucky to know how close we live to it and how amazing food-art is just a stone's ""throw away,"" as long as their is plenty of ""disposable"" income lying around. ;o)In all seriousness, a meal here is without question worth the price tag and was certainly one of the best fine dining meals we've had. It is also definitely a place worthy of milestone celebrations so it was the perfect spot to celebrate my wife's birthday. There were a number of options for the amount of courses to partake in, five to be exact, and we opted for the 7 course degustation which really came out to 11 courses after the amazing amuse bouche and dessert extras.1st beef tartare-cucumber-gin: tasty and very well balanced, also came with two pieces of steak to grill on a tiny personal grill.2nd prawn-pork belly-couscous-saffron: excellently prepared prawn over fork-tender pork belly and savory fine couscous, it was one of my favorites.3rd stuffed cabbage-truffle-truffle jus: this dish was completely covered in decadent truffle shavings. 4th pineapple vanilla sorbet-champagne: excellent palate cleanser before the main.  5th iberico pork-truffle-celery-almonds: our main course had so many different delicious elements to it, my wife called it ""a journey on a plate""...apt.6th aperol spritz to eat: amazing frozen aperol with a lot of sweet and delectable surprises in it like fruit and candied things.7th frozen goat cheese-tarragon-white chocolate-olive oil: sensational dessert that was almost too pretty to eat and despite many of the savory elements, it was still quite sweet and was easily one of my most favorite desserts ever. 8th birthday cake!One thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the fact that we weren't really sure how everything was going to taste ahead of time. There were a lot of new flavor combinations and surprises for our palates which I really enjoyed.Overall, the food was excellent and beautifully and artfully plated. Service was fantastic. We both really enjoyed our entire dining experience and hopefully won't be waiting as long as we did to dine here again."
3,"A very cool place in Hamburg Schanze. The burgers are excellent (150g patties). We came free to eat at 19:30 and had a small choice of tables, the place was fully booked. The potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent side order the the fantastic burger (No choice of a bun but that is okay for me).Only thing is when you go downstairs to visit the toilet you must know that is an old house. Nothing more to say."
2,This place has a nice laid back atmosphere and solid drinks. The food is good and the staff was nice. A nice place to spend the summer-evening with friends.
3,It's a really nice bar with happy hours to some coctails. And they have also nice coffee and few cakes which I didn't try. You could sit outside.
4,"Some weeks ago we finally went to the Deli section of the Tim Mälzers Bullerei. We ordered the Burger and some potato wedges. The staff was efficient, attentive and very pleasant (most of them good looking blond girls) and the wedges were tasty. After a long time in Australia I have to admit the burger was average, but it surely was the most healthy burger Ive eaten in a German restaurant. Tastewise I thought the sauce didnt fit the whole comipilation. Moreover we had cakes, which were massive. Apart from the burger the whole evening was great. Summing up the cost-benefit is high for Hamburgs standards."
4,We love the food there especially special lunchs are yummy :) Its very central and reseanoble prices.
1,I was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Food was not better than normal Imbiss but more expensive. I won't come back again.
3,"Got here close to when they opened and one of the wait staff members informed me that the kitchen was still preparing and that I couldn't order just yet but I was welcome to wait in the restaurant.I didn't mind the wait and everyone was very nice. After about 20 or 30 min, the waitress came by and took my order and my noodle soup came out at a reasonable time. An hour past after they opened and I could tell this is a popular lunch spot as the place was filling up very quickly so be here to get here early to avoid the lunch rush.The menu changes frequently and while they do have a menu with some staples, seems like everyone is looking at their specials board that changes everyday I believe. I ordered off the specials board - noodle soup.The noodle soup was really great! Had a lot of great flavors and on a cold day, this helped to warm me up! I love the vibe of this place! The staff is super friendly and they have a great lunch selection that will please your taste buds.I will be sure to come back to try more!"
2,"I came here during a night out with a friend last week and it was OK. We were looking for quick easy food that wasn't Italian (as he is Italian!) so coming out of a nearby bar saw this place and the hundred or so people inside and decided to check it out. We didn't even realise it was Chinese until we were inside and nearly walked out - often they are just overpriced buffets - but we had a quick look at the food area and decided to stay. This place seems to differ from the usual all you can eat places because there is a pretty good selection of raw ingredients to choose from which are then stir fried in front of you. Plenty of choice of starters, deserts, sushi; enough to fill you up either before or after a jaunt down the reeperbahn! So at just 50 euro including AYCE food for 2, and 2 large beers it was OK. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner for 2 as its big brash and noisy but for pre or post booze fuel stop its perfectly acceptable."
4,"At first, we just went there for hod dogs. It was sunny outside and we were able to put ourselves in the shade to rest (because they don't have space inside). One hot dog cost only 3€ and they add sauces and toppings such as pickles and fried onions. After that, we also took ice cream which was tasty and refreshing."
3,"The restaurant is decorated in a modern eco-friendly way. Creative menu and chill service. Even though not shown on the menu directly, you can request your pizza to be made with gluten-free ingredients. And it tastes great (which is absolutely hard to achieve for gluten-free pizza)! They nailed it!"
4,"I came all the way from Houston Texas, which has a very large Vietnamese population, to taste some of the best Pho I have ever had. I recommend the Pho with chicken and meatballs. If noodle soup is not your thing then try the Vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken. I actually started an account on Qype because of this place! Lecker Lecker!"
3,"Authentic California-Mexican. Do not come here expecting mexican taqueria style tacos and burritos. Come here for something close to Chipotle or El Torito. However, considering the international food scene in Hamburg, the food here is quite good. I recommend the Beef Ranchera and Carnitas. Their Beef Ranchera is obviously stewed and not grilled (like real asada ranchera), but it's still quite tasty. Carnitas flavorful and not too dry. Wish they had corn tortillas for tacos."
4,"I picked out Nasch because of their phenomenal reviews on Yelp, and because my wife is vegetarian. We met up there earlier this week for lunch.The restaurant is quite small, with maybe 20 seats in the front, and another small room in the back (never actually went back there). We grabbed a couple of seats at a communal table, and although it was really tight in there, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. You order at the counter, and they bring your food to the table.I had the masamun curry with red rice, which was a huge portion (see photo) and very satisfying. It had big chunks of pumpkin, sweet potato, and eggplant, and came in a pretty spicy (in a good way) red coconut milk curry sprinkled with green onions, parsley, and peanuts. It's one of the best plates of food I've eaten in Hamburg; I was really blown away.My wife had the quiche, which, because it was vegan, she said was mostly potatoes and sweet potatoes. It was a large slice, and came with a side salad. She was also very satisfied.We split a peanut butter cookie for dessert, which I'm guessing was also vegan, but was soft and delicious like a normal (butter-laden) peanut butter cookie.I would absolutely recommend this place for a casual and hearty lunch, whether you're vegan or not. I hope to be back many times."
2,"The place is dark like Ali Baba's cave. You wait minimum 15-20 min. for such simple meal as crouques. Quality of sandwiches is ok, but nothing special."
2,"We liked this place although I can understand how some people may have things to complain about. I found the interior as well as outdoor seating very inviting and service was competent yet somewhat slow. The woman, whom I believe owns this place, tends to stay inside. She seems to be the most service oriented but usually doesn't do waitressing to tables. Anyway, we come here for the cakes and quite enjoy them. The selection may be somewhat limited but they always seems to have something we enjoy. I especially like their assortment of coffees and usually get a ""Grosser Brauner"" which is my favorite. Food here is kind of hit or miss outside of breakfast. You can pretty much depend on their breakfast offering. I'd recommend simply checking it out for yourself. Do remember that if you are sitting outside and it's sunny or a lot of people are out and about in the Hafencity, it tends to get kind of loud."
3,"This Indian restaurant defines exactly what needs to be important to stay in business in competitive Food industry. This is very well placed restaurant, just 5 mins walk away from Railway Station. It doesn't have any super decorative stuff or some light show on the outside, but still it's not very difficult to find. I shouldn't actually call it a restaurant, but it's more of self service Diner. No fancy decorations or extra comfortable seats to make you sit there for really long time, some light music, everything is surprising. But the best part is food. No Hocus Pokus or 20 pages Menu which makes consumer's life very easy. Food is really very good with prices worth to make student's life easy. I really liked the Lamb Curry there. It's highly recommended. The restaurant also has many varieties of Indian sweets for take away. The food is served in traditional Indian Plates called Thali which was a nostalgic experience - reminded me of Langar (practice common to few Indian religions of community eating). I feel happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys and loves food (while ignoring the ambiance)## The place if often really crowded, which is always the best sign. ##"
4,"Highly recommended for fish lovers, never had the opportunity to try so many different fishes before"
3,"This is our neighborhood restaurant. It is quite simple, but it has a lot of charm. It is a family owned restaurant, run by very nice and friendly people. You are kinda transported to another place, where the children can play on the sidewalk, and everybody knows each other (and we kinda do, because we are also kinda neighbors). So if you live close to here, or are close to the restaurant, come over and sit outside."
3,"I go here quite a lot as its just down the road, does very nice food but most importantly we get a great welcome.There are probably hundreds of Italian restaurants in Hamburg, but this is the place where we take Qype staffers visiting the city for the first time.It usually has a table, and the prices are pretty keen as well."
4,Awesome!!!!!  Fabulous food. Great service too.  The Basil soup was to die for.  A must have
4,"It's like 5 stars McDonalds. Best meat, wonderful staff and modern enviroment. Best burger in town. I reccomend El Torro, burger in Mexican style."
3,After fasting for a week i was searching for a place to eat some potatoes. Ordered backed potatoes less oil and some salad with out salad dressing. But it came with oily potatoes and salad dressing. Apart from it lovely place and staff was friendly. I found my basic backed potato dish was reasonable.
4,"Beautiful cafe in a quiet place in Eimsbuettel,always offering very fresh and delicious food, be it a breakfast or lunch or just coffee&cake. Very customer oriented service, good prices, fine decore in a country style.Tables in a front room (there is another room at the back) are very densly packed, so be warned  your neighbour will hear every detail of your conversation! If it's completely full, most likely during lunch time, expect lots of table and chair shuffling to let customers to get in or out. Have to say it, the place is lovely anyway and worth visiting!"
3,"I've come to Burgerlich several times now with coworkers, family and friends. Generally, it's a good experience. There have been a few times where it wasn't so great, i.e. bathrooms not being kept clean, toilet paper strewn about in the upstairs hall and undercooked meatballs served to my child. Although, upon letting someone know, it was quickly taken care of.The ability to order via the tablet apps makes for a speedy food delivery to your table. I love the chili burger but I find that the meals are quite pricey in comparison to other burger locations nearby. Envious of the recipe for the chili mayo, it's so delicious!!!Highly recommend trying the homemade drinks. My personal go-to is the Basilikum Lemonade."
4,Cool burger place in Hamburg Schanze. Excellent burgers (150g patties). We came to eat at 17:30 and had a choice of tables. Good beers. The sweet potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent addition.
2,"My colleagues in our Hamburg office wanted Asian food delivered during our working lunch.  Being from San Francisco, again, I was hesitant with Asian food in Germany.  Also, Bok is an eclectic Asian restaurant, serving sushi, Thai food, and some hints of Chinese food.  I played it safe and went with the fried tofu with veggies.  Honestly, the fried tofu and veggies weren't bad at all.  Delicate pieces of fried tofu with fresh assorted veggies and a light gravy.  I had a bite of my colleague's fried chicken and it was enjoyable as well.  It came with a side of a sweet sauce, but I didn't use any of the sweet sauce.  If you're craving for Asian food in Hamburg, Bok isn't a bad choice."
4,"This place is well worth a visit if you are in Hamburg and fancy some nice beer, in a lovely setting along with really good food too.We visited in December and the decorations on the brewing kit (yes they brew their own beer here!) and the rest of the restaurant was lovely.Menus are also in English and the food is typical German fayre done very well. Definitely try this place out."
2,"FYI: I only rate the food! :)We went there to have some proper Japanese ramen, this place was recommended by my sister who lived here (Hamburg) for around 3 years - according to her it is one of the few ramen shops.We were excited. We had fried chicken, 2 bowls of ramen (the 12/13€ ones, can't remember the names), and 1 dessert (mochi ice cream). The chicken was good, fresh, good coating, crispy and the chciken was really soft and juicy. It lacked some flavor in my opinion, but I was aware that Japanese tend to have quality food with less intense flavor, natural. There was a dipping sauce, was ok, but I wished there was some sea salt or other additional dipping. Would order it again!The ramen, the main attraction, was a little disappointing, I am afraid to say that. I was looking forward to the broth - it was indeed rich and thick - but it had really little flavor, personally I liked some ramen better back in Japan (like street food ramen for 5€). It lacked the soothing taste of rich porky flavor, Indon't know how to describe. The ingredients, noodles, pork meat were ok too. I wish I could have given a positive review for the ramen, but it was just ok.The mochi ice cream was good, nothing too exciting, but a refreshment after the rich and fatty food. SUMMING UP: I wish it was our favorite ramen shop nearby, but it is not. Whenever we feel like having soothing ramen (esp. on cold winter days), we wouldn't think of the ones here. Even though it is not bad, it wouldn't be satisfying either. The chicken was the best, followed by the dessert. While the ramen in total was almost good, the main criteria for me, the broth, didn't give me that sense of satisfaction I am looking in bowl of ramen.Maybe we will try it out again, in winter, but until then we will hunt for another ramen (if there is any).Not included in rating: The price for everything (fried chicken, 2x ramen, 1 dessert, 2 drinks) was 45€, not good value in my opinion, compared to the expectations I had. The service was nice and quick."
3,"Classic Schanze! I can honestly say that anyone and everyone from Hamburg has been here at LEAST once. Literally, at least ""ONCE,"" I repeat that.  Even visitors have made their way to this bar and the allure is that well, you see it first when walking around the infamous streets of Schanzenviertel.  The typical routes are three main roads of either Schanzenstrasse, Susannenstrasse, or Schulterblatt.  I think Goldfischglas is again popular because it has a club/loungy feel and serves a good full bar at reasonable prices. There are plenty of places to sit, a dance floor downstairs, and a football/kicker table for a male testosterone match or teaming up on a date couple vs. couple or girls vs. boys :)I like this bar because the music is loud enough to listen to, but quiet enough where you can actually talk to people and socialize if you really want to.  They used to have this cool table in the center that had a neon glow with these fish shadows that swam around and they added just enough water on top to get your finger wet if you dipped it in to touch the screen.  People always played with it, because we thought you could control the direction the fish shadows would swim by touching the plexiglas screen, but i am not sure if that really worked or just mere coincidence, haha...People here dress a a bit more trendy than other bars in Schanzenviertel.  I feel this is where the preppy/casual crowd hangs out.  Overall, it is actually a good mixture of all different types and that is what I like, because there is always a different crowd every time I come here.  Sometimes older, sometimes younger, some in hooded sweatshirts and some in polos with Hamburg style red pants, and sometimes just all of the above.  It is also open late, so another reason for the popularity of the late night crowd. They make nice mojitos here and the crushed ice is nice on a warm night!"
3,Good place to eat. Sometimes jut to crowded and so it's not easy to find a place to sit. To order goes pretty fast. The atmosphere is not the best. But good food weighers it out.
4,"It's Saturday night, the place is packed to the limit and the bar staff is doing an amazing job! Sitting at the bar watching them proves they are fast, in a good mood (occasional staff shots) and are making good drinks! Compliments, best team in the area I have seen so far (and I live across the road)! Music, atmosphere etc flawless. Great place to kick off after pre drinks or dinner!PS: and if the bar had known, a shared round of staff shots was offered to me and my friends shortly after posting my review! Glad I had nothing bad to say!"
0,"This place is a no go.They might look like an Italian restaurant, they might act like an Italian restaurant, and they even actually be an Italian restaurant - just a really bad one. Maybe it's the lack of restaurants around or maybe it's just because they are just not good at what they do - they forgot the Italian hospitality and service.How come all the reviews are praising this place?!?!We came here in the afternoon, quite a big group and had a table reserved for us, the menu is a bit confusing as it's full of ads and weird articles.I really felt like having bolognese which is a must in Italian restaurants and they didn't have it, not in the menu and not in the specials. In addition - I had to ask twice for everything (took them 15 minutes to bring my very-not-tasty-from-cheap-syrup Apple juice.My pasta dish was very small, so small I left the place hungry, and not even offered me some Parmesan cheese.One positive thing - the garlic Aioli, which is great."
4,Excellent omelette with ham and cheese. Very helpful translating to English. Cozy atmosphere.
2,"There are more authentic Lebanese/Syrian restaurants in Hamburg. The guys made quite an effort so it's a little bit of a heartbreaker to give them three stars, but it is what it is.The main problem is, that the food really lacks authenticity and yet it comes at a quite high price for what it is. Please trust me on this one I have travelled the entire Middle East and I know what their cuisine is like. As a real Hamburg Docker I'll give you a heads up and recommend looking for another Syrian/Lebanese place to eat."
2,"I was here already few times and every time I ate Sushi. This time I tried out Ramen, Ramen is a kind of Japanese noodles in soup. However, they said it's Korea noodles in soup in their Menu. Anyway I tried out. I was totally disappointed. It was like a kind of instant noodle then put some veggie and beef. The soup was no taste at all and the beef was very very tough.There are wide range of choices in their Menu.  I can say some restaurants try to increase their choice in their Menu but a lot of dishes are not up to standard.  I came across there are some restaurants are only selling one kind of food but there are long queue in front of their door. This restaurant made very good Sushi and why they don't concentrate on the food they are strong with ????In any case, I had reviewed my disappointment with the witness and they told me their boss is a Korean and not Japanese."
3,"My usual usage of Irish pubs is based on large TV screens and football - with little else of merit, so I approached the Irish Rover with trepidation. But this is an Irish pub as it should be: Dark, cosy, welcoming, friendly, Kilkenny and Guinness on tap and good solid food! In particular the Guinness was as good as it gets outside Dublin and the fish and chips comes with real chips (not frites, not french fries, CHIPS!!). The clientele was a mix of ex pat Brits and Irish and young Germans. Always a good sign. You would take a place like this for granted in Dublin or London. But for this frequently travelling Brit finding a good traditional pub in Hamburg whose attraction is based on good beer, food and company, was a real joy."
2,"I was in Hamburg for work and was brought here by a local who seemed to eat there regularly. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was what you expect from an expensive Italian Restaurant. One weird thing was the only English menu on offer was on a giant chalk board. A waiter brought it round and we had to choose there and then. It was different, but fine and had no negative impact on our experience. The food I chose was very good. I had Dover sole that was really tasty and then at the end we shared a huge plate with one of each of their desserts in it. Again it was very nice. If you like Italian food then this place will probably appeal to you. Just be aware it was also on the pricey side."
4,Fabulous.  I had the Endivine crepe anda glass of  Ventoux rouge.  The Roquefort sauce on the crepe was delectable.  The place is absolutely charming- including the staff.  The tables by the windows are so quaint.  This is just what I needed.
3,"So much more than meets the eye when entering gute stube. Go for the garden in the back of the weather allows for it. You get a lot of food for your money, we had the chicken salad. All good ingredients, however the salad was lacking a rinse. The rest was great. Delicious homemade bread was served as a gesture, and we had a delicious home made lemonade with strawberries and mint. Definitely worth a visit, and great service all the way through."
4,"I always thought that burgers are something you get at McDonald's or Hesburger, but that changed when I came to Hamburg. Oma's Apotheke was the place i've tried my first real burger and I still can't find a place to top that. The staff is very welcome, interior is good, the food is great! What else do you need? :)"
4,"I feel like I am in an Abbott & Costello movie when talking about this place... ""Where are you going?"" The Daily, ""No, not when, where"" The Daily! ""Ok so you go daily"" ""yes but it's The Daily""!! It could go on and on. But the most important thing here is the food. Not a big coffee drinker so don't ask me how good the coffee the was. The food on the other hand, that I can tell you about. The food here is pretty good and the prices you can't beat. Each day they have a different ""special"" warm meal. However, they always have a choice of delicious soups, hearty pastas, and warm baked potatoes to please the belly. I always seem to get the daily special which my favorite is the lasagna. It just melts in your mouth. The layers of cheese and sauce, and more cheese and more sauce. Ok now I'm hungry. Anyway, to top it all off they have some tasty muffins and cakes as well. Just be sure to beat the lunch rush because it will be hard to find a place to sit!"
4,"A long line in front of this place hinted that the reviews were legit. Each scoop was 1.40 EUR, a bit more expensive than usual, but you get a taster of another flavour for free, on top. Onto the ice cream itself: one taste of it and we were hooked: the coconut sorbet is quite simply the best coconut ice cream we've ever tasted. It kind of reminded us of Booja-Booja's Coconut Hullabaloo, until now our favourite - only that Luicella's was ten times better. Pistachio was also very good. Highly recommended!"
4,I go here when I miss Vietnamese food.Only regret is that they do not serve Vietnamese food during lunch hours.
2,"I've never been to this style of restaurant before and found it rather amusing. Whilst the food wasnt exactly 5 star, there is plenty of it and the quality was good. I was in a group of 4 and we found the service to be quick, polite and attentive. Whilst the visit was on a Tuesday evening (not exactly prime time) the atmosphere was good. If you love ample portions and no frills dining I'd recommend this restaurant."
4,"While visiting my friend's father for the weekend, we walked around the block to this restaurant for lunch. It was great, fresh ingredients, well prepared food, and friendly service. So good we went back for dinner the next night, equally fantastic. It's clearly popular with the locals (who ought to know!) as the place was completely full on a Tuesday night. Highly recommended. Price was reasonable too!"
0,"This restaurant has the distinction of having the rudest waiters I've ever encountered in a life of eating and traveling. I lived above this restaurant for six weks and ate there only once, my first night in Hamburg. I went in alone after having slept all day following an exhausting trip. I walked in, slightly disoriented because I expected something different than the nice surroundings. A  waiter with an overly-tailored beard approached me in English and gruffly asked me if I wanted to eat inside or out. I apparently took a few seconds too long to decide and exasperated him. ""Inside or out?"" he demanded. Only because I was famished and still exhausted did I stay. I sat in a secluded corner and was ignored for fifteen minutes, then requested service from another waiter who was busy doing something behind the bar. I wasn't happy, but too tired to leave. No takeout. Great. He then felt it necessary to lecture me that I wasn't in America when I simply offered a curious comparison to the size of the coffee cup presented. He eventually lightened up and complained that I tipped him too much. (I kept getting conflicting information about tipping in Germany). The owner did come over and ask if I liked the meal. It was just okay, but I said it was very good, other customers seemed to be having a good time. This wasn't enough. He looked at me for a moment (the stare) and didn't say anything else, then turned and left. They had an inflated opinion of the restaurant and of themselves, an arrogance similar to what I encountered often in Hamburg, but nowhere else in my travels throughout Germany and Paris this past summer. A sweet young lady smiled and said goodbye as I left, as the first waiter tried to make a point of ignoring me as he dried a plate. I really wished I had had dealings with her instead of these arrogant fools. This experience was so surprising because I had just stayed a week and a half at the Hotel  Kempinsky in Berlin where I experienced, with one exception, nothing but the absolute best service, most professional demeanors, and genuine smiles at all times."
4,"The perfect place to have an original Indian meal. It takes you to the middle of India!Der beste Ort, an dem man ein kleines Stück Indiens erleben kann! Wirklich indisch!"
2,This is an OK bar which tends towards stylish. Fairly dark and modern atmosphere. Still fills up at times with a pretty local crowd. Prices are OK. Bartending is average. You can sit outside in the summer and people watch pretty well. Only problem I have with this place is that at times at draws exactly the crowd you would try to avoid in Ottensen. Not typical though and always a good default place for a couple of drinks. I used to really like the Hollywood Canteen which used to be at this location prior to Reh Bar opening up. Unfortunately that place went downhill after moving. I guess then Reh Bar is a better alternative.
3,"We went to Brodersen after a hard but successful day of work in search of a decent reward. All I can say we found it in some delicious German classics that probably did not extend our life expectancy, but felt truly rewarding. I had the ""fischer frühstück""  (omelette with some type of north see shrimp named ""Krabben"") and my friend the pork filets in cream sauce. I always felt that speck is the perfect matrix for pan fried potatoes, and here this was confirmed. All was very delicious. We finished up with two large plates of ""rote grütze"" (jello made with real berries) which was also state of the art...slightly sour and not too sweet containing big fruit chunks. Very nice! I can only recommend this place!"
4,"What a blast! Really enjoyed this place.  Got there early (0930) and was pleasantly surprised how few people were there already. Spent about an hour just looking through all the models and by the time I was leaving there was of pretty good crowd of people coming in. So I was really glad that I got there early. One thing I was not expecting was all the interaction that you could have with the models they were buttons that you could push to make certain models move. Of course, as a pilot, the airport was my favorite display and I could've spent a lot more time there"
4,I went there last month for the first time to take my after-lunch-coffee. nice little cafe near to the campus with delightful turkish food. My all time favourite for lunch is the self made PIDE  tastes great. yummy!
4,"My wife and I stopped here for dinner after work one night. I've only been in Hamburg for a month or so, but this is easily the best burger I've had in my time here. I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my wife got the Zillertaler Bacon Burger, and both were fantastic. Her's was a little heavy on the sauce, but that didn't really detract from the burger other than to make it messier. Prices were also totally reasonable.They've got great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. They even project whatever is on TV outside as well, so we were able to keep half an eye on the F1 qualifier."
3,It was good. Price was good. Service very friendly.  Location is convenient right by the train station.
3,Great coffee and cakes. Friendly and efficient service. Chic and stylish decor. I would definitely visit again if in town. It was also possible to eat dinner although we had other plans.
1,"I came here a few weeks ago on a Friday around 7PM with my wife. We found a seat outside and waited 30 minutes to order, then another 40 minutes for our food arrive. The burger was pretty good and really tasty, but it's such a disappointment after waiting for so long. They definitely need more servers and more organization around how you order.We've been to their old location and really anticipated something better here, but it seems like they are still working out the problems in their new location. I'll give them another try in the future, but be wary if you show up hungry."
4,"OMG Winterhude has a cosy coffee shop with wifi! Cute, not so little coffee and brekkie place with friendly service. Good coffee. And they had some teas too. Can't believe I didn't know this place all along. This place can be a good work from coffee shop place :)"
3,"This was a pleasant surprise. Even after having read the other reviews, I was not prepared for the sheet size an ingenuity of the whole thing.  Floor after floor of painstakingly detailed models, with some really funny details here an there. Especially the airport is worthwhile to spend some time admiring the lifelike planes and vehicles, including the specific sounds that each plane makes. Quite incredible!"
1,"A bit pricey but nice burgers, although you have to wait at least 30 minutes to get your order. My last visit I ordered fries with a burger, and I waited 30 minutes for a burger after that had to wait ten more minutes to get fries.Good food, slow service. Overall you can find better places in Hamburg, for less price."
3,Been here twice and the fish was great. Very fresh. Great view of the River Elbe. Service was good and prices reasonable.
3,"Copperhouse isn't bad, actually it's quite good. I really loved their lamb and halibut. This is an Asian food buffet/ teppanyaki style restaurant. It's 25 euros for all you can eat, so it's more of a come while you're starving kind of place. Most of the dishes are pretty mediocre, but the lamb and fish were delicious. Hence four stars instead of three. Some of the dishes included stir fry fried noodles, fried duck, egg rolls, fresh fruit, and fried bananas. I also had a strawberry colada which was pretty decent as well. There are some things that need improvement such as their not so good sauces and cold chocolate cake (honestly a chocolate mousse from the local supermarket would be much better than this).  Also, the sushi could use some love. I'm not sure if I would come back on my own, but if someone else suggested it I would probably come along. Oh, it's also located right on the Reeperbahn, so it's a good place to get loaded up on food before your drinking night out."
3,"Yummy burgers, good fries, nice staff OK prices. I like it here :)"
3,"Good place to go with friends if you are in Hamburg. Perhaps a little bit touristy, but it's fun! Went there twice during my stay in the city and had frankfurters and bratwursts, along with a cold Bavarian beer."
3,"A restaurant full of surprises . The food was good (altho the pork chops felt a little bit overcooked, were pretty chewable still), the environment was romantic and relaxing. We also had small house salads for free and a typical Croatian shot for each person on the house.The price was very reasonable too (35 € for 2 people).But the menus they had were only in German and Croatian , and the waiters were not too good at English, being unable to explain what each course contains . Overall it's a very good restaurant and I'd definitely go again."
0,Qrito would have been an even better if they didn't charge people a euro for ten grams of jalapeños! A pretty bad experience don't think I'll go back again. But go on I am sure the burritos won't give you much more than gas.
3,"I had the Labskaus, I think a Hamburg dish that looks like boiled beef and has the consistency of mashed potatoes. The restaurant and food are fine, but more notable is the street where it's located. My coworker tells me Deichstraße is one of the oldest streets in Hamburg, and the origin of the big fire of 1842 that burned down half the city. You can sit out front if the weather's nice, or take one of the alleyways around back for a great view of the canal and surrounding architecture after dinner."
4,"I'm from New York and was looking for a healthy place to get a salad and Daily You is by far my favorite place to eat in Hamburg. Everything is tasty, cheap, and high quality. The chili is very good. The salad bowls are all excellent. I've had both the teriyaki chicken bowl and tofu bowl and both were great. I'd recommend asking for them with lettuce if you want to skip the rice, but either way is good. The pasta bolognese is also very good and comes with an amazingly large portion of protein. The staff were extremely helpful (we only speak English) and the food came out fast. Would definitely recommend."
4,"Really cool vibe (I kind of want to live in here), friendly/attentive service, and excellent drinks and food. The waffles and poached egg with avocado on toast are standouts. To top it all off, the breakfast hours are very generous! My favorite coffee shop in Hamburg"
4,"Super cute ice cream shop ! The place is cosy, modern and full of charm.They have different and original flavours such as strawberry-rosmarin, salty caramel or coconut-strawberry. If you have allergies, it is really easy to understand how the ice creams are made of, thanks to a colours system. They also create vegan ice-creams ! You can either eat inside or take-away."
2,"So many people had recommended Herr Max to us, so I looked forward to breakfast here.We ordered two different breakfasts, two coffee and two orange juices and the girls working here totally mixed it all up and forgot half of our order. When we finally got it all it both looked and tasted really good, and the café is really charming as well. I wish that I could give the café a better ranking, but unfortunately I found the service too bad for that. The girls forgot orders, ran around looking stressed behind the counter and had no order in what they were doing. And that's just stressful to watch as a customer, even if the food/cakes are good."
2,"It seems as if most major cities have a Hofbrahaus, and it's not a bad choice in my opinion since the food and beer are at least decent. I'm not German, so I can't speak for the authenticity of the cuisine. I can, however, speak for my satisfaction.The English menu is pared down compared to the German menu, so look back and forth between the two to get a full understanding of the selection - especially the beers. I ordered the pork shank. The skin was charred to a semi-darken crisp that enveloped the layers of succulent meat and gelatinous fat inside. Its entirety was sitting upon savory but slightly sour gravy. Served alongside were pickled root vegetables and a warm potato dumpling. While the food was appetizing, it was difficult to cut the pork without having the flakey skins fly everywhere. Fortunately I was wearing my throw-away clothes, so I didn't mind spilling gravy and pulling oily flakes of pork skin off my shirt. Note that the portions are HUGE! I could only finish half my plate. If dining with friends, I would suggest splitting the dishes. Because I came in during the afternoon on a day that was between Christmas and New Years, it was relatively empty. I am sure this place gets packed and rowdy during football matches since they have large television screens broadcasting games. The interior consists primarily of large picnic bench seating - ideal for groups of 6 or more. There are some two-person table sets, but I wouldn't go here to have an intimidate date or conversation.Overall, I would recommend this place if you would like good food and beer over a casual conversation with a group of friends (think ""happy hour"" and work event type of space)"
3,"Amazing displays, super crowded, but a fun place for kids and adults. Def. book advanced tickets. There's a helpful charging stations with all kinds of cords to plug your phone in if you have exhausted its battery by taking too many pictures, lol."
4,"Great atmosphere! Food and drinks were very good as well. 4 of us sat in the front bar area. Thumbs up for the shrimp ceaser salad, focaccia bread and potato soup. Food, 2 beers, a Moscow Mule, and wine coat around 60€. A little pricey but nothing we wouldn't pay for the cool, modern atmosphere and quality of food."
4,"This Miniatur-Wunderland is the biggest model museum in the world (in the Guinness Book of Records). They have various model constructions from Germany to USA.  There is so many houses, automobiles etc that make up the areas with most of the model villages/areas with moving elements from people to automobiles. Throughout time at the museum the lights will dim to give you a glance of how the model village looks like at night as well as during the day.  The night scenes are as spectacular as of the lights that come on in the houses, etc.  I highly recommend to anyone and don't forget to press the buttons to make some of the moving elements move.  Highly recommend to anyone that loves trains and models that move and light up."
4,Even if you are not a big fan of Absinth (my case) I still recommend you visiting this place. The owner will find something (out of a 200+ different sorts) that suites you. This is a great place to go and relax after a hard day at work or maybe just talk to your friends. If you are not aniseed fan then try King of Spirits.
2,"As usual took half an hour to queue to get in here, then we were sat in the window so the queue could get then watch us eat our meal. The food is OK, the service friendly and I get the local loyalty from a Hamburg chain-done-good but each time I visit Block House I vow never again. There are a lot of much better places to eat in Hamburg."
4,I can't be better :) I love it. I had lived Sheldon cooper's dream for few hours :)
3,"Another pizza success! Came to Al Volo for a lovely Saturday lunch. We arrived right at opening time so there was only one other table occupied. The interior looked nice and new. We sat at one of the tall tables with stools. I ordered the Margherita while the Mr. ordered pizza salame. The dough was thin and chewy, just how I like it. The toppings were also very tasty; the salame had quite a bit of a kick! The size of the pizza was just enough--not too much, not to little. We washed it down with some wine. The location of the restaurant is in a nice area, so great way to have some good pizza and go for a stroll afterwards."
4,"What an amazing experience, it was made more interesting due to the language barrier for me. Friendly staff and the menu kept me guessing. Once the friendly guide knew I was Australian he made an extra effort to translate most things for me which I really appreciated. I booked online from Australia and the customer service was top notch. All my questions and queries were answered promptly. I went by myself and wouldn't recommend it unless you can speak German as unless you are lucky like I was tonight you will struggle knowing what's happening."
3,"One of the only restaurants with terrace overlooking the Elbe and the beach in one of the nicest and oldest areas of Hamburg where the old Captains' and fishermen's houses are lining a pedestrian street. The only thing missing are cobblestones. Only the walk along Oevelgoenne is worth it: the abundance of flowers, the meticulously maintained houses and the views of the Elbe and the sunlovers on the beach make you distinctly feel on holiday. The restaurant is primarily axed on fish and shellfish with soups based on lobster, shrimp cocktail and classic fish preparations as main course. Some innovative touches like dried flower petals in the soup). Nice place to linger, but it is also a popular place, so you cannot linger too long.."
3,"Ate here when the vegan restaurant Froindlich was too full and they recommended Xich Lô. There were plenty of vegan options and I loved the red curry. Another table nearby ordered something interesting with dry ice coming from the meal-- looked amazing. -1 star because the still water was not my favorite. I think it has a lot of minerals so it might be healthier, but it just tasted really bad to me. Also the dessert portion was a bit small.  Overall a wonderful spot, fast service and would recommend for vegans."
3,"Cool old fashioned bar with classic cocktails on the menu. Good music, old School and new. It's low key but in stylish and chic surroundings. A perfect cocktail bar where you can relax with a drink and have cosy conversations"
3,"Azeitona's charm comes from its rundown but cozy establishment. Great place to eat really cheap and really good food. I had the mezze for 2 and It was wonderful. My personal favorite: their hummus! The place is perfect to hang out with friends, but it's not that big...so don't plan your next birthday party over there. On the downside, staff might have been very friendly but they were rather inattentive. Also, I had a pomegranate lassi which was not nice at all. It was small and way too sweet (taste was rather artificial). If you want to drink something opt for tea. Other than that, I can't wait to try another dish. Mucho love, D."
1,"I know salt is cheap but how much you need to put into the dishes? I really can't tolerate it, way beyond my average intake. I think the food is authentic indian food, unfortunately I can't enjoy it. By the way, service is awful. When I asked for a vegetarian dish recommendation, I immediately get impatience from the waiter. I know they don't live on tips like being in America, but come on, I'm a customer and what I got right back from him to my husband is ""She's difficult""The two star is for the atmosphere"
3,"Went here recently as one of my colleagues recommended it. Everything was tasty and seemed fresh. The place was packed at lunch so many other people also seem to think the place is good. It's fairly tight seating-wise but again, if a lot of people are here, things are being prepared fresh and it's a good sign in my eyes. There is an extensive menu and the pricing is definitely fair for the area. There is also seating out front if the weather plays along. I wouldn't call this place a ""destination"" but surely a good choice if in the area."
2,The coffee and breads here are superb but coffee temperature is below mine thoughts! All staffs are friendly....Ofen I go with my friends
2,"This Mexican restaurant serves quality and authentic ingredients that deserves 5 stars. However there are some things that make the experience mediocre. For example, the dishes have unique ingredients or are prepared uniquely e.g. cactus enchiladas and chicken tamales. But, the Enchiladas are small and not ""loaded"" with cactus. Everything has too much cheese and the tamales are mostly corn meal, I could not seem to find the chicken in them. The Mojitos were too sweet. Generally Mojitos are made with soda water with dissolved sugar, not sprite with dissolved sugar. Overall food & drink quality 3 star. It took the waitress a while to come to our table (although we were one out of two groups at the restaurant). She also seemed to be more interested in cleaning the bar (which looked perfectly fine) than to serve the customers and avoided eye contact. Also, the food took a long time to come. Maybe it is because of the special preparation required, but an appetizer takes about 30-45 minutes to come before the main entree. The service in my opinion was 2.5 star quality. This place could be better, but there are some improvements that need to be made."
4,"I have been there a couple of time with friends visiting Hamburg. It's always been an incredible evening. Franco makes feel at home, but no only. The food is incredible. I cannot recommend enough this place."
4,I'm so sad we didn't take a picture but all the food we ordered were all really good. Friendly staff and delicious food. I will definitely go back next time.
4,"Neapolitan Pizza, how it is supposed to taste. :)The interior is more spacious than it seems from the outside; comfortable, but no setting for a cozy night out or so (Ottensen's 'Farina meets Mehl' is more pricey, but better in that respect).But the value for lunch is excellent here at €7 for a Margherita and a water, a little more for buffalo mozzarella. Not aware that any of the other Neapolitan places even comes close (well, Schanze's Pizza Jill is good at lunch, too).Will be back and will bring the kids."
4,Sehr coole Location !!
4,This restaurant has lots of vegan choices which are delightful and the service is always friendly! It's a restaurant I always love coming back to!
4,"I keep finding myself coming back here. Gloria is a lovely laidback cafe style bar, with tables outside, really friendly bar staff, and great pizzas. I'm always surprised at how little the bill is at the end of the night too! A great place to spend a Sunday evening..."
3,"Sofabar is one of those classic hang-out bars which every good city has. Like everyone has mentioned, this place is just one huge room with a bunch of sofas to park on while enjoying your Astra, cocktail or whatever your drink of choice is. A very laid back vibe, even if on Friday/Saturday nights it can get rather busy. Prices are fair (2.40 for an Astra). They usually spin good music, which is just loud enough to have a conversation over. The lighting adds to the atmosphere and the large glass windows makes it a good place to watch whats going on on the street from the comfort of an old couch ;). Overall one of my favorite places to have a beer in Hamburg."
4,This place is just beautiful. It's my favourite city escape. Perfect for walking your dog & Sports! I highly recommend this park! Go there & explore!
3,Some London bars should visit this place to learn about customer service!! This was my first experience of a Hamburg bar and I was impressed by the welcome I received. The manager 'Patrick' greeted me like a local and ushered me to a table whilst he fetched the drinks (no jostling for the bar mans attention required - Fantastic!!) Initially I was a bit sceptical of the music and atmosphere in the bar as loud 80's music was being belted out by the DJ and crowds of men were merrily singing along and dancing (??) however I found myself quickly getting into the swing of things and before I knew it I was joining in with my new 'friends'. (vodka induced?)Patrick then introduced me to the bars 'secret shot' and again I was impressed (not to mention shocked) as the shot was delicious and tasted of strawberries and cream!!This place made me smile - I will be back!
3,"My wife and I stopped off a Wednesday around 7PM and the tables were all full, so we grabbed seats at the bar. They had a happy hour running from 6-8PM and we grabbed some buy-one-get-one-free beer and ""atomic"" wings. They had Ratsherrn on tap, which is a local beer I really like. The atomic wings came out pretty quick and the staff was really curious about them. They are incredibly spicy, we did 3 wings each, and were nearly crying. But we like spicy, so it was good thing, but the wings are no joke. We moved on to our second and burgers. I had The Jack, medium-well, drenched with blue cheese. The fries were reasonable, just so-so, but the burger was huge and tasty. The burger buns are muffins, but it's a nice touch; they hold together pretty well, even covered in burger juice.Great place for a beer and a burger. They are really proud of their American beef and I could definitely taste the quality. The service was a little slow at times, but the staff was really friendly overall. I'd go back."
2,"This is just another Asian in the line of those which are pretty far from original Asian food. Vegetable is not cooked enough, most of the dishes are way to spicy and place is mostly empty which makes it even more unatractive. Service staff is good but that's about it."
3,"The best burger I have ever had in the Europe thus far. As an American, I'm pretty picky on my burgers - I love them, and I've only been scarred by my experiments in Europe with burgers. When visiting...Hamburg, my friend and I thought it'd be fitting to have...a hamburger, in Hamburg. An acquaintance recommended this place, and they were right - it was great. The atmosphere is like a hip Mexican hipster cantina, despite no Mexican food. There are old punk records over the bar and really friendly bartenders. We didn't have a reservation, so we had to sit at the bar, which was fine. We each had beers and I had a burger (something Texan) with an egg on it (I love eggs on anything) and my friend had a cheeseburger. The burgers themselves are HUGE, and were perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. They fell apart and were very juicy. The weirdest thing is that the burgers come on *English muffins*. I had experienced that before with a good burger in Seattle at brunch recently, but..it was a bit odd. I think the burger would have held together a bit better with a sturdier bun, but, it makes the place unique. I'll surely revisit this place when craving a burger in Hamburg again. Delicious!!"
4,Amazing experience! Really good service and even better food. Felt like an evening in Thailand - definitely value for money!
0,"Probably the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Rude, condescending and exceptionally slow."
2,"It is kind of sad that in a city like Hamburg, where so many restaurants and shops offer fish, it seems to be impossible to get some really good fish and chips.Henssler is no exception.I can not say anything about any of the dishes you can get inside the restaurant. I just wanted fish and chips to take away. And it wasn't bad. But that is all. And from a name like Henssler, one would expect a bit more.Maybe Hamburg simply isn't the place for a simple portion of fish and chips. If you really want that, wait till you get to Travemünde for example. Had fish and chips in a small and extremely simple restaurant in the port of Travemünde and was surprised by the way better quality than that of Henssler at a lower price."
4,"Most delicious tapas. Had a birthday dinner here and I have never had more mussels for 9€. We almost couldn't finish them, but we did. Totally recommend, the house wine is so easy to drink. Love this place!"
4,"Great little lunchtime venue with a superb value set menu option. Choose anything you like from the mains, plus a selection of delicious starters, and a desert for EUR7.50. Everybody finished what they ordered, and the food tasted fresh and healthy. Lots of salad, dressing... all that good stuff. On the downside - it's extremely dark in here for lunch - but then, Hamburg is quite dark at the moment, and, they didn't have the lamb because it was sold out. Probably a victim of tasting too nice. Try this place."
1,"A big Bavarian style bar with litre masses of beer, staff in Bavarian costume. the food is quite good and the place is fun with a group of people. The staff could be more friendly."
3,Very satisfying pizza. Crunchy thin crust. Many toppings to choose from including pineapple and tofu. Vegan friendly options. Nice seating at wood tables. Menu available in German and English language.
3,"Just around the corner from my flat in Hamburg, this place is brilliant with a group or just on your own. I have eaten here a few times and its my favourite local. It does great Roast Potatoes and lovely Weissbier!"
4,"BEST RESTAURANT IN HAMBURG...and maybe the world :-) I have eaten here a few times, as it is close to my place, and it is an amazing experience each and every time !!The food is always superb, and (counter-intuitively) the staff are friendly, warm, and welcoming, yes, even if you are a large party, normally dressed, and with a crying baby (what can I say, we like to push the limits). It is truly one of my favorite places to eat in the ENTIRE world, and will keep coming back even if I have to move from HBG."
2,"This Schanzenviertel brick icon is popular amongst everyone for their Hamburgers, meaning the food and also the local people, the spacious outdoor bench seating up on the hill next to the U3 and S Bahn stop, and the thick pommes (french fries)  that you dip in this flaky sea salt for flavor!  Mainly a lunch spot for me, but for dinner, it gets romantic, as there are soft candles glowing everywhere and a basic, but classy menu offering fish, meats, and pastas.  I had a wrapped baked fish once with steamed veggies and herbs that was not only healthy but had a nice wholesome flavor to it.  Portions are plentiful and prices are fair.The staff speaks limited English, because it really is more a local spot, but the chef here is famous and for such a reputation, the food is delicious and affordable. Now they have this outdoor grilling area for Kalbbratwurst or normal bratwurst and also for those tasty french fries we all love.  They make a relish mayo sauce or something with herb that gives it a slight yellow/green tone, but it tastes awesome with the fries and get some salt flakes also. It is some special sea salt that looks like light snow flakes, you can not order fries here without that!!!"
4,Can't really say enough about this place. Locally sourced carvery meat and home made potatoes and knodel. Very simple concept and reasonably priced. Very impressed with the quality and the service. A short walk from Messberg station.
3,"Thursdays and Saturdays, children get free food!Very friendly service.I like their grilled chicken."
4,"Einfach TOLL !The food is great, the prices are really correct, the place is lovely and the service is perfect !Nothing to add but GO and enjoy :) !"
3,"Top meat, a bit cold (big doors that don't isolete) and friendly service.Not seat next to the door downstairs if you don't want to freeze!"
4,"It's a small menu, but the food is consistently yummy. Service is relatively quick for Germany, and has so far always been friendly and pleasant.Cocktails are *not* strong, but they are tasty - order for the taste, not the booze content. I recommend the red sake ...thing. Can't remember what it's called, but it's a sort of pomegranate-mint concoction. The tea is nice, too; the green tea is flavourful and comes in a generous bowl. The spring and summer rolls are always delicious. Always.You can't get a bigger, cheaper, better bowl of pho in Hamburg! I've had chicken, beef, pork, and tofu soups, and haven't had a bad bowl yet.Edit: if you're not in the mood for soup, get the bun cha (or bun something else) - crispy pork on warm noodles with cold veg and sauce to pour over it. So, so good, and quite filling. Oh! And their garlic-chili condiment sauce is so good you practically want to eat it with a spoon. I just shovel that stuff into the soup.Atmosphere is very casual, and if it gets crowded you may end up sharing a bench with strangers: it really is street-kitchen style. But that's not bad - it's very convivial. When the weather's cold and rainy, the windows all steam up and everything feels warm and friendly.This is one of the best places for lunch on a cold Hamburg day. Highly recommended! But note - it's cash only!"
3,"Ach, das gute alte Meyer Lansky's- immer eine sichere Sache. Ich muss sagen, dass ich den Service hier immer durch die Bank weg erstaunlich gut finde. Die bieten dir schon einen neuen Drink an, wenn der alte noch nicht ganz aufgetrunken ist...naja, ist vielleicht manchmal gar nicht schlecht, wenn es mal ne kurze Pause zwischendurch gibt ;) Hilfsbereit, wenn man an einen anderen Tisch umziehen will und den Cocktail bekommt man noch zu Happy Hour Preisen, wenn man ihn vor dem Ende der Zeit schon mal reserviert hat. 1 A. Toiletten sind auch zu später Stunde noch völlig ok. Was ich allerdings richtig schrecklich finde, ist, dass man in dem Laden rauchen darf. Schade!"
1,"Borchers is a local bar and restaurant in Eppendorf, with a large dining room and an even bigger outdoor patio and sidewalk seating area. It's the kind of place that I can imagine has been here for years, and like a certain bar in Boston, everyone might just know your name.The atmosphere is nice, the service is friendly, and the food is edible, but none of it seems to come together into a cohesive dining experience for me.On one visit I had the Seelachs (pollack?) with potato salad, and on another visit I had the Wiener Schnitzel with white asparagus, potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. The fish was decent, but the Wiener Schnitzel was unremarkable, and the asparagus was overcooked.I suspect Borchers is a great place to sit outside and drink beer on a warm day, but the food is just not that good."
1,"After trying this place twice I can't honestly say I would go back. The food was ok, not great, but ok. It seems that kidney beans are quite expensive as I never seemed to get very many in my burritoWhat was bad is the waiting. It has both times taken a little longer than 1hour. The argument is that it takes 45 to bake them. There are faster ways that are equally good, if not better. Only go there if you don't have any appointments afterwards"
3,It was pretty amazing but you need to put hours aside to truly appreciate all the fine details.  We were only there a couple of hours and I found it interesting but did not have enough time to check out all the details.  I was pretty disappointed with their USA display but the European countries were absolutely beautiful!
4,"UPDATE 28/04/2009: Been meaning to edit my review of JB for a while, as they've hugely upped their game a year on, and now serve what I think are my fave burritos in Hamburg. Also - the staff who work here are all ace. Last night we got treated to the Vicious Viper hot sauce (see photo), which is officially the hottest sauce in the world. Probably. ***** Passable burrito action slightly sparse on the sauce side of things, which is a bit ridiculous if you're paying an extra euro for guacamole. Still, they're nice enough and the place has a bit of character, along with these weird TVs from the back seats of cars stuck to the counter playing all sorts of weird films."
3,"Really authentical. We wanted to have some good Indian food and we got it here! The food is great and people are nice. The place is not fancy but clean. If it is full you have to bring a little patience with you. The only negative point could be that at the end of the night you do not have so much choice, if the dish is over they do not do it anymore. At least you are sure that they prepare it fresh!"
3,"I really like this patisserie. The owner bakes everything himself and the pastries taste absolutely fantastic and also look good. I really like the atmosphere in this little retro café: simple but cosy :) You can also get a typical German breakfast for 6,90 euros (worth mentioning that all you can drink coffee is included in the price)! Service is friendly and they have papers you can read whilst chillaxing away. The location is quite possibly the only annoying thing because you do not usually come past this place unless you know where it is. Then again this is not necessarily a bad thing, they always have customers inside so I presume the locals know this place well and keep it a well preserved little secret"
3,We went here for the second time. It is a great experience to walk through the rooms with a guide who explains the life as a blind person. You walk through different rooms and experience the life as a blind person. At the end you can buy something at a dark bar. It is a very special museum.
3,"This is a pretty small restaurant with a bar and is only open for dinner. They serve northern german food and have day tickets posted same day, as well as a traditional menu of the same dishes offered everyday.I ordered labskaus, which is corned beef with two fried eggs, beetroot, herring, and pickles. The dish was pretty simply without complex tastes, although I really enjoyed it (this was my first time having labskaus). My family ordered veal schnitzel (served with yummy sliced potatoes and side salad) which was decent, although nothing to rave about, and pancakes, with gorgonzola cheese and tomatoes, which were thin and crepe-like. My mom was really happy with this meal as she didn't want to eat anything ""german"" or meat heavy.I enjoyed my experience and would come back here to try another simple german meal, although the meal didn't leave me ""wow'd"" and of the nature that this place deserves the extremely high 5/5 rating."
3,"Froindlichst is an all-vegan restaurant in Winterhude with a variety of foods including burgers, pizza, burritos, and salads. There's also a full coffee and tea menu, a few cakes, and an ice cream section.I had the ""Den Burger"", which is some sort of play on words that escapes my feeble German. It's a lentil patty on a bun with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, ketchup, and some kind of basil cream. It comes served with too few sweet potato fries, and an extra little plate of the basil cream. The burger itself is quite large and filling, and actually pretty tasty. The condiments seemed like too much at first, but when you realize how dense and large the patty is, you're glad to have something to dip it in. The fries are pretty fantastic, but again, there aren't enough of them.To say I was apprehensive about trying Froindlichst would be an understatement. Aside from being a vegan restaurant (a category I mostly avoid), there were a few warning signs. First, my wife had made a reservation online, but when we arrived there wasn't a table set aside for us. Fortunately, there were plenty of empty tables, but this seemed like an opportunity for disappointment. Second, the service was perfectly friendly, but when we placed our order, the sound of juicy burgers hitting the grill didn't exactly emanate from the kitchen. Laid back, they are. Fortunately, all's well that ends well, and at the end of the day, I left satisfied and pleasantly surprised."
4,"One of the coolest bars i have ever been to in my life. 3 room flat, is a 1970's house party. Well, on the surface. beneth lies a secret german fight club, i mean table football club...its kind of sureal. the beer is cheap, and the selection is plentiful. the sofas are comfy, and the people are nice. But piece of advice, the toliets are alittle unclear as to which is guys and girls...not that anyone minded...germany is a very liberal place"
4,"One of the best zoos EVER!! This is our annual tradition in Hamburg, and we would not continue if the zoo wasn't so spectacular!!! First, feeding the elephants is the most amazing thing. Second, being right in with them lemurs to the point where they jump and sit on you is craziness. The aquarium is top notch. Feeding the baboons is crazy fun for kids of all ages, and finally being face to face with the lions is an experience you can not miss. I would not miss this zoo if you are in Hamburg. Worth every penny!!!!"
3,"When you are up for a brunch with a twist, that's the place to go. And the twist is middle eastern/mediterranean, yamm! Inside and outside, as previous posters wrote, it's nothing special. Probably pretty boring bar. But believe me, exciting brunch! Honestly, I'm tired of these endless pasta salads. Not in Chakra. Along with brunch classics like cheese and sussages, omlette, salmon, there are also baked aubergine, tabouleh, hummus and other spreads. Olives, fetta cheese, all sorts of antipasti are there too. It's reasonably priced and I have no complaints about service."
4,"Great food, fantastic service... Loved the ambience"
3,"The french name and ""Cuisine Fine"" claim makes it sound like it's a fine-dining restaurant, which it actually isn't. But it doesn't matter, because the food is actually delicious and the service is friendly.We had a little bump at the beginning where it took them almost 30min to get us the drinks, but they were apologetic enough for it, even got us a drink on the house which is very rare in German restaurants where the service is usually terrible.A 3-course menu (goat cheese salad, burger with fries and creme brulée) costs 27€ which is very fair. The drinks are also good."
3,This Russian Tango-class sub is well worth a visit. bear in mind that it can get very cold in there.
3,"Good food, and the wines were priced  faily compared to retail prices (the bottles we bough at, €49 and €99, were about 2xstore prices).The young waiter from Sardinia was very attentive and coped completely with strange Danish humor;)"
2,"Quick and cheap pizza to go. The dough is great, the toppings are lame."
4,"mein erster eindruck: guenstig, frisch gesund und super lecker!!! hatte die nr. 1 (ente mit mango und minze): ein wahres (frisches) und originelles Geschmackswunder.toll, dass es dieses lokal gibt!!!"
4,"Easily one of the best authentic Korean restaurants outside of Seoul. A pure, honest delivery of everything I adore about Korean cuisine.I ate here every lunch for a week, and sampled a broad range of items and found it all good.The Kimchi Jjigae is punchy, spicy and enriched with belly pork and pork broth. Loaded with flavorful kimchi and presented with a bowl of rice and 3 banchan, this was a must have staple for me at every meal.The pork bulgolgi was tasty, spicy, and fatty--perfect for stirring into rice and more banchan.The djajiangmein was a surprisingly pleasing bowl of spring udon like noodles, earthy slightly sweet black bean paste, and little morsels of pork to give depth and rounded mouth feel.Bibimbap was accompanied by fiery Gochujang sauce and loads of banchan vegetables.Service is friendly and quick--walk all the way in to the end of the bar to place your orders for lunch. Reservations necessary at night--especially on the weekends! They are fully booked for good reason."
3,"Elegant Italian fine dining restaurant along the Hamburg riverfront. Parking is a short walk away. Delicious food plated gorgeously. Good white wine. Attentive, efficient service! Bravo!My whitefish was 2 generous filets with crispy skin. The accompanying vegetables and mashed potatoes were also yummy. My friend has a large portion of steak which he enjoyed tremendously."
4,"Imagine being the coldest you've ever been, yet happily chilling at a lovely beach bar sipping on a super delicious Pimm's cocktail and eating what appears to be one of the only 3 vegetarian items on the menu. Are you imagining this?It is amazing. Fun decor, great people, interesting bathrooms, and a really great casual vibe. Come for the drinks and the great view. Eat something so you don't get totally wasted. Drink some more and then vow to return. Rinse and repeat."
3,"Simple cuisine, friendliest waitress and great terrace to have some fresh mint tea in a sunny day!"
3,"Considering it was a miserable, rainy day with high windgusts -- This was still a gorgeous area to dine. It would have been nicer on the terrace, but the interior is very modern and nice.I couldn't forget the Sweet Curry Coconut Chicken Wok (Chicken, Mango/Coconut Curry, Tomatoes, Grapes)  if I wanted to. It was decently priced and extremely tasty. I was suprised and very pleased."
4,"The original Mo Griller and the Currywurst is the bizzomb!!  I went here four times during my one week in Hamburg.  It would have been five but I missed them by 2 minutes on my last day, so sad, haha."
2,I was a bit disappointed by the breakfast on offer but the cakes were good. Coffee not so good. Very nice mood though and lovely interiors.
4,"I visit this restaurant for over 10 years and it is a heavan of indulgence for those who go for spectacular view, impeccable service and the best food you can get in this town. Diners can choose between different set menues, parts of it and a small extra menue of dishes all pleasing the palate. The vast wine-cellar is stocked with very rare blobs but its even more fun if you entrust the sommelier to take you on a trip around his vast knowledge of wines from around the world  all served by the glass and fitting to the plates you have chosen. Don't miss the adjacent cosy Hotel Bar for the nightcap. BEWARE: the water depth of the inner Alster Lake opposite the hotel is only 6 foot, there is no possibility for drowning after the bill is cleared!"
1,"To summarize:1. Friendly but the person plays with his iPhone all the time2. Food is not good. Phó --- is not good, because the meat seems not very fresh. 3. Would still recommend for people who never had Vietnamese food. Because the environment is not bad for hanging out with a group of friends ..."
4,"**UPDATE 13/7* Music was absolutely fantastic in here last night! They really have an awesome DJ who doesn't want to bring it down till 7am, so we just couldn't go home! Plus 1 star from me, and highly recommended free venue for the 4-7 slot before you're off to the fish market! ********I really like this place, even more now I know they serve really cheap cocktails until midnight! It looks great empty, but you'll mostly see a heaving sweaty crowd of revellers. I'm not sure there are any fire regulations in Germany as I regularly see clubs/bars with more people than would be legally allowed in the UK, but, it's all good fun. Till there's a fire."
1,"Basic, average food for premium price. I ordered the seafood plate- it turned out to be boiled seafood with a watery sauce and a handful of sliced veggies no side dish, even though it costs 16€. I wouldn't recommend this place."
0,Do not reserve tables online. We arrived with a reservation and they were full. Refused us a table even though I showed the reservation on my phone. We reserved several nights in advance for our last night on our vacation and ended up with having a burger instead!

Indeed while u're visiting the zoo, u could bump into peacoaks, pelicans or goats and other cute animals. There are a lot of cute puppies that borned in zoo. This zoo has a secret..  At the entrance there a stand where some people give u a bag of vegetables. Here it's allowed visitors to tAke care of animals (surely vegeterian ones) and feed them. To take an example, u could touch elephants and give them beetroot! They love it!!"
4,"I'm now a regular patron of Mr. Kebab. It can't really be beaten. You can get a really great (and rather large) donner wrap for EUR3, or perhaps a few skewers of lamb/chicken with rice, bread and veg for EUR7. If that isn't enough there's a huge mountain of meat and salad which is EUR20 ish between two. You'll never finish it though. The toilets are also worth mentioning. It's like some crazy freaked out disco in there - what's that all about?!"
4,"First bar I went to in Hamburg and don't need to go anywhere else. It's amazing. I did my washing, drank weird Germen shots and was so drunk I had to be escorted home."
4,"Just wow... A must see and well really the only main attraction found in Hamburg. It might appear childish at first, but its far from, its a historical masterpiece. Whether you'd like to reminisce over your childhood modeling years, or your world wanderer this exhibition of tiny animated models will take you back. Outside of your personal experience, this would positively impact your child's imagination offering mechanical and historical significance. Prepare for a 3-4 hour visit, there is so much content I'd advise review it in detail. In any case you will miss something. Great for English speaking visitors, and German natives."
4,Looked for a place to eat near the Crowne Plaza and saw the Sangers was close. Went for a short five minute walk for a wonderful meal that was made and prepared with quality and care. Six of us were in the group and not only was the good worth the price the flavor was amazing.
1,"Sotiris ..... Well ...... It was quite an experience ..... A bad one, mostly.... Ok, maybe the food was let's say 'ok', and the prices were good, BUT ...a 'greek' restaurant with arabic decorations that the owner (or the manager, I wouldn't know for sure) treats a GREEK customer (that goes for the first time and very excited) like s*** ... well ... for sure I wouldn't go back .... I haven't experienced so rude behavior EVER. And even though I called from the hotel to do a reservation and told me it wasn't needed, I got there and they told me they were full booked. I waited (even though I should have left) and I sat with other 2 people I didn't know, after being asked -in greek- 'so,what do you want?' (!!!!!). They told me they'll change my seat later but didn't. Awful smell and treatment. Talk about 'greek hospitaliy' ... BS I say ... I'm guessing the participation (and publicity) from Adam Bousdoukos (Soul Kitchen movie) didn't help much, or if it did (as in my case) it won't help in the future. They need to learn some manners !!!!!"
4,"If you like great handmade pizza in 10 minutes, this is a place to check out. They have a creative weekly offering of different pizzas (even vegan and sweet options) are available. The staff is nice and the prices are fair for the central location."
2,"Good quality which doesn't go together with service. Pity. The coffee is ok, but very light. Delicious selection for breakfast"
4,"The food is very good and the price cannot be beaten! The plates are huge, so don't order a big starter. If you do, I wouldn't choose the nachos, they literally just put them on a plate and fill three different package-sauces in bowls... meh.I ordered a tiramisu after my big ""Schnitzel-Burger"" with fries and even that was huuuge! And delicious as well! ;)Crowded literally everyday at everytime! No matter if you wanna have breakfast, lunch or diner! So the sound level is really high and you have to speak loudly to your counterpart.But it's definitely worth to wait a short time to get a free seat. Reservations aren't possible, it's a typical ""Kneipe"", but a really good one!"
4,"While traveling through Europe we had the good fortune of trying the St. Georg Steakhouse. We had just arrived in Hamburg and were hungry for something substantial, so we opted for a steakhouse. We ordered the Ribeye Steak and a glass of Montepulciano. The steak was the tenderest, juiciest, most succulent piece of meat I ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The waiter spoke English and was prompt and efficient. The ambiance was quiet and enjoyable. We were able to carry on a conversation without having to compete with loud music. We loved our ribeye steak so much we went back for another on our last day in Hamburg. If I ever go back to Hamburg I will visit the St. Georg again."
4,"This place was amazing!  The place was easy to find and very cute inside.  They had an English menu; our waitress was amazing and spoke fluent English, and made great suggestions with the menu.  I had the Spätzle with cheese and bacon and my boyfriend had the special, a lemon and rosemary Spätzle - both were large portions and very delicious.  This was our first dinner in Hamburg and I would recommend it for anyone! I would recommend if you have a larger group to make a reservation ahead of time, as a good portion of the tables were reserved when we arrived.  They also have Wifi for anyone traveling."
2,"A pretty good burger here although it's more than just burgers and not really a restaurant. A bit on the pricy side but a good choice and good quality. A nice touch is them giving your order a local street name rather than a number, e.g. Jaguarstieg or Königstraße."
3,"One of the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever tried! Dishes are amazing! You can get a big bowl of fried chicken, rice and vegetables for 10€.I'm used to go there with co-workers. Please note that space is really reduced, the restaurant is usually crown around lunching hours (around 12pm - 1pm). Unfortunately, the menu is just in German on a blackboard on the wall (just pick randomly...)"
4,"An absolutely wonderful experience. I hadn't expected much and was really overwhelmed by the amount of detail in the tableaus. There really is something for all ages in the Mini Wunderland, and my whole family spent a lot of time marveling over the beautiful landscapes. I recommend booking an early time-slot; it only gets more crowded during the day. Take the guided tour and get behind the scenes. It's worth the €15!If you're head is filled up after a few hours, you can get a stamp on your hand and return later in the day. There's always more to explore!"
4,"Usually portions in Germany are pretty huge and I am not able to finish them. That was not a case in this place, but not because the portion was too small. It was just so tasty:) Also, I definitely recommend Scweinemedallions mit käse:D Also I'm a big soup fan, so that will be my next thing there to try out, as for I saw they serve it inside big piece of bread.Should be tasty. They also have vegetarian menu, pizzas, salads and what else not, so there definitely should be something for everybody.Prices are really ok, too.Other than that this place is great because of its location and its really has that vibe, that you want to spend there all those rainy Hamburg evenings."
2,"Nice Place to Drink One or two coktails and have some soulfood. If you go there Be thirsty , hungry and enjoy :)"
4,"Let me preface this by writing that normally, I am not much of a zoo person. However, I was really impressed with Hamburg's Tropen Aquarium. I was amazed at the lemur exhibitthe lemurs jump on your shoulders, leap from ledge to ledge, and scurry around the floor. The zoo keeper in charge could tell them all apart and was clearly very experienced. While the lemurs were by far my favorite part of the aquarium, I also really liked the variety of fish and reptiles they had. I even got to see a live feeding of the sharks! You don't have to be a kid to be really wow'ed by this place."
4,"I love this cafe. When I was there they played great music...David Bowie, some fifties music, some hip hop, very eclectic. They are open late on the weekends and have a full bar. St. Pauli is a nice neighborhood of Hamburg, and this cafe was super cozy. The vibe was very chill, the prices were fair, they had soy (soja) milk. I got the latte macchatio with soy cold and it was delicious. The Wifi is free, the staff is super friendly and young. The atmosphere is hip without being pretentious. I felt very comfy. They also have a lot of local events listed on the walls, and the staff spoke great English as well. Lots of cool german magazines to read. Some outdoor seating as well. And, its was fun to try the 'deathpresso'....Dont miss this spot"
4,"Absolutely delicious combinations of ingredients which left me reeling days after I had dinner there! Asparagus season is in full swing and nearly every sea food dish we had incorporated asparagus somehow, whether it be in the sauce or simply accompanying vegetables. Friendly staff there too made it a pleasant evening. It's also possible to sit outside which is nice on warmer evenings. Dessert, namely Spanish style creme caramel with strawberries, asparagus and mint salad, was absolutely scrumptious! Will definitely be recommending this place to friends and returning there myself! Reasonable prices, especially worth it due to quality of food, and all set menus are def worth a try!"
4,Really good vegan breakfast foods! I had the scrambled tofu and my girlfriend had the blueberry pancakes and it was both delicious! We had to wait a little bit to get a seat and to get our food but the tasty food makes up for it. Definitely bring some time and hunger!
2,"We went to Brauhaus Joh. Albrecht with four other guests for their last night in Hamburg and we wanted them to taste German dishes. We booked a table for 9pm. They took a while to take our order but the dishes went pretty fast. The dishes were what we expected and quite good. Then, we waited 30 minutes to order some desserts but they never came to ask, so we had to get up and ask them. After taking our order, they came back to tell us that the kitchen was closing so they couldn't serve us desserts. Hopefully, after repplied them that we waited 30 minutes for them to come and take our order, they agreed on doing it. The dishes were quite expensive regarding the service and the only thing they asked, was if we wanted to let a tip..."
4,"I go to Jim Burrito at least once a month and I've never been disappointed with the food!Now that they reorganised the restaurant the service is even quicker. The decoration and the atmosphere are great, the music is cool (often rock).Huge pro: They have 3 menus- omnivorous- vegetarian- veganI recommend the quesadillas (served with guaca, sour cream, salsa and salad) or burritos if you are reeeeeaaally hungry"
4,"Great tapas. A good blend of Spanish & Moroccan styles and a good opportunity to try many dishes. I had a small lamb tagine as one dish and it was superb - maybe the best tagine I've ever had: so many great flavours. Very friendly staff in a stylish, modern restaurant."
4,"Absolutely excellent! We sat on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant for an excellent meal. They brought us an English menu as soon as they could tell we were not German-speaking. If you're looking for the traditional German meal or something new, you'll find both. I had the traditional veal cutlet (weinerschnitzel) while my brother had a fish salad that was also fantastic. The fried potatoes with bacon were to die for. The bread and spread that they brought to start was also very good. A tad pricey, but worth it for a great meal, service, and people-watching location."
4,Hamburg is the SF of Europe. The harbor vibes with them dope coffee shops mang!!! Nord coast is one of the more classy joints with food on their menu. It overlooks the water and has a good amount of seating. Their lattes and espressos are on point. The cost wasn't overwhelming and their staff is very friendly. A great place to meet up with people.
4,I was expecting to drop by for an hour or two during my visit to Hamburg.  My wife and I ended up staying over 5 hours.  And although I felt the enterance fee of 13 euros was high before I went in after I toured the attraction I didn't feel that way at all.This is the best thing to do in Hamburg hands down.  2nd isn't even close.  I'm now a mega Minatur-Wunderland fan.
4,"The niciest coffee shop in Hamburg. Absolutely love it! It's run and decorated with so much care and taste, that it's worth just to go and check it out. And if you'll only see these freshly baked pies, tall and brown, with apples, poppy seeds, blackberries, rhubarb, plums anything you can imagine (depends on the season of course), you know there's no escape! They all stand on the table to tease your gastro-imagination, there are plates and cutlery next to it, whipped cream too, if you want. Of course, white table cloth, beautifull china, classic furniture. Let me tell you more about furniture: the whole place is like a living room of somebody's apartmet. There's wallpaper, paintings and drawings, tiffany lamps, wooden tables and chairs. It's intimate and warm, cosy and classy. It's nice and welcoming atmosphere both in the evnings and at the daytime. There's a garden for warmer parts of the year. There is variety of teas and coffees to go with these fabulous pies. They also serve food. And I heard that sunday brunch is fantastic (that's what I'm gonna check next), just make sure you are early enough!"
3,"Since I normally don't enjoy the kind of Chinese food you get served throughout Germany (keywords: heartburn or glutamate) this place here is a positive exception.Starting off with the amazing cleanliness of tablecloth and furniture: No sauce spots or spilt soy sauce like one is often used to. Besides staff here are friendly and stunningly quick. Their menu consists of different (regional) Chinese specialities, however, prepared differently. Maybe in an affectionate way - or just made with real expertise. Prawns, fish, meat and veg all just close to being perfect: veg being al dente, the meat tender, the seabream crispy and the sauces very well/naturally flavoured. The food is different from the usual Chinese stuff in 2 ways:the creative recipes and the meals' way of presentation. Beautiful! And if you are into the crazy-shaped, carved carrots that suddenly have turned into swans, a pagoda or a whatever bird then this is paradise for you. So prices are obvisouly quite a bit higher than the Chinese take-away's around the corner but it's definitely worth the way over to this spacious restaurant. Recommended!"
1,Not very interesting. The display is a bit old fashioned. And just for the ones who like me use to carry with them a purse that is not a very small one you will be firmly asked to let it at the entrance The two main interests for us were the cozy restaurant and the bookstore.
4,Great restaurant with delicious Food and services! Highly recommend it! Pho is pretty authentic Vietnamese northern region. We went there a few times when we're in Hamburg.
0,"Very poor service: disorganized and unfriendly staff that can't handle any pressure. We ordered two drinks and we've waited 25+ minutes. The staff up until now, has been unattentive and rude."
4,"Oh my gosh, I love this place so much.My husband and I are huge ramen fans, and this place never disappoints. We've been to several ramen restaurants in Düsseldorf, and Zipang may even be an inch above those. We usually get gyoza to start, which is perfectly cooked with a flavorful filling. The miso ramen is my go-to choice, and it's always perfect the way it is. I love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the broth is so tasty. Mochi is a must for dessert. They sometimes switch up the flavors which is nice. I've had chocolate, vanilla, green tea, and black sesame. It can definitely get crowded in here, but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a seat. The outdoor seating is nice in the summer, and I like the Japanese style of the indoor seating. Definitely looking forward to exploring the menu more and coming again and again!"
3,"Pretty decent little St. Pauli pub in Eimsbuttel. It gets packed when there's a game on. For the nice summer days they have a large number of benches and tables outside, allowing Urknall to double as a bier garden"
4,Great little place in Hafencity. Great food and great service. Nice place to sit outside on a sunny day with a glass of beer and watch the ships go by. Inside space is very limited.
4,"Brilliant. Very impressed with this place. Had a lovely lamb steak with a honey-mustard sauce and figs. Very reasonably priced, stylish and friendly. The place was full on a Monday evening  that says everything."
3,"I like to eat lunch here on Mondays and Fridays. Mondays, they usually have noodles, on Fridays, they have fish for today's lunch menu."
4,Walking in the door the delicious smell of brewing beer. Chicken spinach curry was today's special for 7 Euros. Messing beer also delicious and reasonable.
2,"Not bad! Ok, I had a pretty good time here. The drinks are pretty cheap and from what I can remember, the strawberry daquiri was really good! This is more of a dive bar and get shitfaced kind of place. The music was loud but not too loud thank god. I would probably come back."
4,"I can't believe I've missed this little gem for so long! Meine kleinraumdisko is a deceptively tardis-like bar/club just opposite the REAL supermarket by Feldstrasse U-bahn. Low key beats being mixed at conversational volume, cool sofas in a number of corners, trippy visuals on projected on the walls, and Augustina beer for 3 euros (which doesn't give you an Astra-style hangover of death) make it a compelling destination! I'll definitely be spending a lot more time here."
4,"If you like interior design, you'd be pretty much satisfied in this little austrian café. Fine cakes (e.g. Sacher, Frankfurter Kranz), very delicous. And in case you are not looking for typical austrian flourfood (mehlspeisen), the hearty snacks have my recommendation as well. ""Weisswurst und Brezn"" with sweet mustard, as well as beef meatballs with salad for less than 7 euro in that kind of athmosphere, marvelous. Drinks are sort of pricy, but for the location still affordable."
3,"Original Persian food, nice place, wide variety of persian foods, and also some traditional persian I've creams!"
3,"Shikara is a good Indian food place. I have only tried their lunch buffet which for a flat fee you get a full meal (an entrée, main course and desert).  They have friendly staff and a nice outdoor garden area."
4,"A good place for burrito lovers and ""alternative"" people.I'm vegetarian and burritos are one of my favourite foods, so when I found this place I was excited to see their menu is conveniently divided into meat/vegetarian/vegan selections - with more than enough choices in each category.The burritos are big and juicy, the kind you have to eat with a fork and knife, and are some of the best I've ever had. When it's busy you might find yourself waiting quite a long time for your food, but the atmosphere is nice and they specifically say that on their menu so there's no surprise. All in all, one of my favourite places to eat in Hamburg so far."
4,"Looking for organic food in Hamburg, Google found this for us. It is truly a little paradise. Our host Peter Kühn took great care of Colleen and me!"
2,I found the atmosphere to be very cool. The place was full. A friend and I from Canada have been on a mission to find awesome Asian street food. This place unfortunately did not deliver. We ordered the spring rolls to start. The filling was good but the spring was burnt. For our mains I ordered the chicken pho and I asked for extra veggies like in the veggie pho. The broth was ok. The noddles and  veggies were also over cooked. My friend ordered the crispy noodles with beef and veggies. She liked her dish  but didn't love it. I don't know if I would go back. My go to Asian street food is still Quan Do in the city! It's amazing !
4,"Have been coming here for many years - simple, excellent food.   My only complaint is that the price for the Normandy-Cider has become sort of crazy.     A small noise about a restaurant which remains high on my list.   Recommended for sure, especially for foreigners who think Flammkuchen is some variation of Pizza! (pfffffft!)"
4,Please go here to sample some excellent food and beer. A hidden gem in the centre of Hamburg.
3,"Who here shortly after the opening appears, actually always finds a place. That changes completely fast, at the latest if the conception is terminated in the nearby theatre, becomes it here very much full, then one has sometimes the impression the kitchen is something overtaxed (can last already times longer). But for a really good meal first you have tu find the place. No sign points the way to us. One must belong to the insider. The village is accommodated a wine tube, in a cellar, with a remarkably variedly bill of fare."
4,"Fabulous!!! Friendly service, terrific food, beautiful setting. They made my husband, our toddler and I feel welcomed and appreciated. Plus the lamb! The wine! We can't wait to come back!"
2,"I was quite curious after all these great reviews!Unfortunately, underwhelmed by it myself.Let's start with the good: the servers are fun, the fish is fresh and cooked well, the location is 'typical Portuguese quarter' (but note that this means a view of parked cars and being surrounded by smoking people when seated outside).But the cooking was hit and miss; e.g. Tuna with a mint pesto - excellent, fruit sauce with white fish - awkward combination, steaks - completely overcooked; the order medium rare - get medium well kind of off the mark. The house wines we were recommended were not good at all, the white still being the best of the three. The red wine was served outright warm...Be prepared that the 4-course meal, 50€ plus drinks, will be very filling; they definitely don't skimp on portion sizes here."
4,"This place is great. It's the only ""real"" bar in Hamburg where the bartendar probably knows more drinks than you. I used to tend bar so I am inclined to have a broad range in regards to drinks. The guys here blow me away with their knowledge. Great bartendars to ""chat"" with and talk alcohol. The vibe in the place is cool. Everyone is here because they know they are going to get the best drinks. Period! The fact that it's pretty classy in terms of the little details makes it that much better. I made the mistake last night of planning on going there after dinner for a drink with my girlfriend. Well, one drink became two and you know the rest of the story. Now I just need to figure out how best to get over there to go pick up my car. Tip: don't drive there for 1.) the obvious reason of thereafter not drinking and driving but, 2.) because there is no parking whatsover in the area.....it's all residential and you have to drive around quite a bit to find a ""legal"" spot for the car. In summary, if you're looking for ""hardcore"" bartending and really quality drink, this is your place. It's a bit off the beaten track but it's always ""on the way"" somehow. Do your best to visit!"
4,Delicious Turkish Kebap Meals are waiting for you.I can recommend every meal grilled on their barbeque. All Kebap Meals are Delicous **The Staff is very friendly **
2,Delicious but maybe not as hyped as everyone says. Not worth waiting 30-40min by any means.
4,"War etwas skeptisch ob der stylischen Einrichtung, ungewöhnlich für einen türkischen Imbiss, dient aber nur zum weiteren Wohlfühlen. Superlecker das Essen, frisch. Irre nett und gastfreundschaftlich der Laden. Optimales Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Da gehich bestimmt noch mehrmals hin."
4,this place is awesome for kids and adults.  Its amazing how much detail went into creating all the miniature trains and figures.  The new airport model is in a class in its own and I watched it for half an hour before my girl friend pulled me away.  This is a must see attraction in Hamburg*this place often gets full quick but you can make a time reservation so you don't have to stand in line.  The later evening times have less people and are more enjoyable.
3,I really liked this place. It was right around the corner from my hostel and right next to the Hbf. Interior is nice and gives a sailor-y vibe. Decent seafood selection which is what I was looking for. I got the fish soup and it absolutely hit the spot for lunch when I had a hangover. I tried the house beer which was a good darker beer as well. Would recommend for weary travelers looking for port food.
1,"I have been at Casa Rita for lunch with some colleagues.First of all, I'm not sure why somebody would define this bistro as ""Italian"". Yes they do have a selection of different type of pasta dishes but I would find it difficult to define any of them Italian.They have a wide selection of food to make a personalised antipasto, but I cannot judge it since I haven't tried it.The bread looked good and tasted great; I cannot say the same for the pasta (we ordered three types) which was generally overcooked and tasteless.Since I wouldn't visit it again I will give it 2 stars."
3,"That's a weird beer. I like it but in Germany it's surprising to taste one that is so much different than most others. The weizenbier here is a little sour but it is pleasant, refreshing. Still, I don't know if I want it again or not. The haxe is tasty and fresh, although not that big portion as it first seems. A bit expensive but I guess for that part of Hamburg it's ok."
2,"Sausalitos is pretty much a night club that serves food. This place is really nice for a bar/club but i wouldnt really call it a restaurant. The food is what made me drop off a star from the review. We went there with a large group of people and had a table reserved. The service was really great and fast considering the place is packed (it was a thursday during their happy hour specials). The food is your typical bar finger food. Considering they advertise themselves as a mexican restaurant i thought maybe the nachos would be good. I ordered the nachos and the cheese was extremly hard and a pain to seperate each chip. I got the guac and salsa on the side. Spoiler alert: the guac here is NOT green...it was a little grey looking and it barely tasted like guac. The waiter confirmed it was the guac i ordered. I would highly reccomend to stay away from the nachos. The food might not be great but the drinks are AMAZING! They have really fun cocktails here and awesome specials during happy hour. I got the 'flying kangaroo' and it tasted like a milkshake and you dont event feel the alcohol, but there is a ton in there. Also, the drink sizes were HUGE! The ambiance is totally a club feel, the music is WAY too loud you will find yourself screaming at your friends sitting next to you. In the basement they have the 'club' which has hip hop music, different than the 'restaurant' upstairs."
2,Beautiful view of Harbour in Hamburg however the service is incredible poor and unfortunately the cocktails are mediocre at their respective price point.Nice if you want a great view not if you're just interested in drinking
2,"Regional food from Franken (Nürnberg) - northern bavaria. The roasts are very good, bratwurst and a nice selection of beers (try meister). Roast potatoes are fried not roasted - minus one star"
4,"So we wanted to check this museum out so badly because we had read so many good reviews and heard great things about their collections.  And then vacation happened and we almost ran out of time to see it at all.  But...we had to at least go see the special Dali exhibit that they currently have there.  So glad we did!  If you are a Dali fan, you will love this one.  I wish I could say I saw lots more of their permanent collection but I didn't.  We had to browse through in about an hour and that is nowhere near enough time to see it all.  We knew we were going to miss loads so we mapped out the major pieces/exhibits that we wanted to see the most.  If I make it back to Hamburg I will have to go here first thing and give it a proper tour.  They have a really lovely building and have built an amazing collection."
4,Best weekend breakfast in town! Lovely terrace when the weather permits. Great coffee in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
4,"As an American, I eat Mexican food often! It's rare you leave North America and travel across the Atlantic to find Mexican food as good, maybe better than where you started. Jim Burrito is a great place to have yourself a Burrito or Quesadilla! Everything we tried was authentic and more importantly, DELICIOUS! Go there!"
3,"Sehr gutes Sushi, viele Sushi-Variationen, sehr nette Bedienung, frische Zutaten! Preislich etwas gehoben, kein Vergleich zu all-you-can-eat Anbietern."
3,"Happy hour EUR5 cocktails until 9pm. EUR3.50 Augustiner Brau. Cool interior, good central Altona location. It does have a bit of a problem with very awkwardly sized and positioned tables, but otherwise it's a cool bar."
4,"Probably one of the most unique things you'll see in your life. Worth seeing! The airport section is just incredible! Perfect for anyone: family, couple, friends."
4,"Great DJ, great bartenders, inexpensive drinks, friendly and fun patrons!  Did I mention the bartenders are good looking?  What more can you ask for?  Well, I guess the bathrooms could be a bit better.  If you are in Hamburg, this is definitely a cool place to come check out!"
3,"Carrywurst, beer result in philosophical reflections), matchless Ceazar salat!"
3,"A great little cafe nearby to where I live. Very designer'ish and liked. Tends to get quite full, be it during the day or in the evening. Their opening hours could be better but I'll take what I can get. Coffee is great and they have good, fresh-pressed juices. The service is always good and they have the nicest waitresses. As a side note, a bunch of people mentioned wLAN. They no longer have a T-Mobile hotspot and I couldn't connect to any open network. The one from next door at Marinehof seems to have also been disconnected. This is a major drawback for me as I can't consider this an office-away-from-the-office without connectivity. I'll still stop in though now and again when meeting people in town for a coffee."
3,"Large portions, mostly friendly staff although nearly getting into a shouting match with one of them simply because we waited about 10 seconds before telling him that we were switches tables with another group is definitely something that should never happen.It also didn't help that a friend wait first to the counter to order his things before I went simply we both didn't want to leave our valuables at the table unguarded. Ordering seems to be complicated here ;-)That being said, the good was great! I had a huge Enchilada with Mole Poblano on top of it. Not a big fan of the chocolate flavor here but that was totally my own fault for not reading the menu ;-)We also had a Burrito which looked and smelled excellent!I would definitely go there again but only when its not too crowded. If the two incidents with the staff hadn't happened, I would have given Jim Burrito 5 stars."
4,"Our favorite Chinese restaurant! Good service, delicious food, and quiet atmosphere."
4,"Think of Mc Donalds or Burger King and then think better quality. JB's is a fantastic burger bar in Barmbek. It's a bit of a walk from U S Barmbek and situated underneath Block House.JB's and Block House are tied together business wise or were. Someone told me about that but I forget the full story.The burgers are a big sized and packed full of tasty stuff ranging from fried mushrooms, bacon, cheese. All with a good dash of salad. Plus frieds or garlic bread on the side.Insider tip: Try the garlic bread!! It's the same as Block House. So incredibly tasty!The restaurant is nicely sized with kids area. It's also well kept and maintained. Staff service is also pretty good. But expect a queue around 6pm when everyone decides they can't be bothered to cook."
3,"After a visit and concert at the Elbphilharmonie we dined with a group in the private dining room. The food and service were excellent. Don't expect cutting edge food, just beautifully cooked and presented classic French cuisine, a salad starter , a slow cooked beef daube with herbed potato mash and a sublime creme caramel. Coffee was a caffeine hit short black. Wines matched well."
3,"My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner - first birthday in Hamburg! I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience here. Located in the lovely neighborhood of Eppendorf, the restaurant is situated on a street near other shops and restaurants, but it's not super bustling. The setting is great for a nice intimate dinner for two or with a few friends.You get two tasting menu options for 108€. The differences in the menus are slight, with the first course and last course being different, otherwise all dishes in between are the same. We went with Nouri's Menu (that's the chef). The courses included the following:1. Foie Gras 2. Tartar of Beef 3. Couscous with 7 vegetables4. Monkfish5. Nouri's main course - braised ox6. Almond foam with mint granité and apricot7. Roses sorbetAll courses were plated beautifully! Each course was also bursting with flavor and the flavor combinations were quite interesting. I was definitely able to detect all the Moroccan influences. In regards to the food, I wouldn't say it was the best Michelin star meal I've had, but it's near the top of my list for overall experience, especially for presentation. If you have a few extra Euros sitting around, I'd recommend an evening at Piment."
3,Better than Va Piano since I can sit and wait for the food to be served at more less the same price. Go for the pizza.
3,"What I enjoy most about this dining experience is the location. The view in the Hafencity area is lovely on a sunny afternoon and sets a nice mood in the evenings either for a relaxing or romantic dinner. Perhaps both! The service is warm and friendly, and if you would like to especially try a more authentic dish which is not represented on the menu, kindly communicate this to your host and if the ingredients are available, they are happy to accommodate. Being Thai myself, there are only a couple places in town where I feel I truly receive a taste of Thailand, particularly because of the nature of spiciness that is found in our food, as most European options are more mild.  I enjoyed the curries very much and rice noodle dishes such as the Pad See Ew.The decor has charm and provides a choice of floor seating or a table view near the window that looks out into the harbor neighborhood."
1,The bar is situated in the heart of eimsbüttel. The interior is nice and cosy with lovely vintage sofas. Unfortunately we were disappointed by the cocktails. We had a Gin Fizz which quite frankly had no fizz and a Mojito which was nothing more than ok. I do hope that the coffees served are nicer as it's a lovely little place.
3,"The place is quite neat and spacious, for such times the seating is very well spread out. Food is mostly good. Got a bunch of dimsums with jasmine tea. Had a few types of shrimp dumplings and rice-rolls, totally recommend. The xiao long bao is a let down though, no broth just the minced pork. And the egg tarts were also okay-ish. We got there at 20:15 and their kitchen closes at 21:00. The waitress was constantly on our back to order and kept reaching for our order sheet (you write your order on a notepad they give you). We had to rush eventually amd write a bunch of numbers for our order."
4,"We went to Meine Kleinraumdisko the other day after a hard night's drinking gluhwein at the DOM. A few friends were over from the UK, and one had brought a bottle of ""Pendle Witch's Brew"" as a present (see photos). Unfortunately being completely drunken the beer was lost during the course of the night... that was 5 days ago. On the off-chance that it was still there and had been saved from consumption, we turned up there last night. Amazingly they had found it and kept it! (see photos) The place itself is a cool little bar that I always think of as being on feldstrasse, but is actually on the bit that is called Neuer Kamp. Very confusing. The decor is 70s-styled wallpaper and disco lights. The music is chilled and there are loads of sofas to lounge about on. As far as I'm concerned the beer is Augustina."
4,A museum totally dedicated to chocolate! The guided tour was excellent and we sampled lots of chocolate along the way. Definitely recommend visiting when in Hamburg.
2,"Pretty good curry for a shopping centre, but it's definitely not the curry mile of Manchester. Chutney has a slightly limited choice of around 4-5 dishes, and you queue up to buy it and then sit on stools. Quick, but not really comfy. They say you have to buy a large meal if you want to eat in, but in fact, you can get a small and just sit down anyway. The curry is at least on a par with Shalimar but for loads less cash, and slightly less grand surroundings!"
2,"Have to agree with previous review, trendy enough but I was irritated by the micro-portions. A few grams of food are not going to be enough to fill you. In fairness, what food there was did taste good."
4,"Well known to hamburgers, but something of a secret for people from out of town, it's taken me 3 years to get there!Tucked away behind the exhibition halls in Lagerstrasse you go through what appears to be a Culinary Wholesaler, up an industrial staircase and enter a world of meat. Yes it's almost a palace dedicated to the consumption of flesh.Beautifully laid tables and Napiery, serious steak knives, great bread,  four types of salt, a warm greeting, promised that what would was to follow would satisfy deeply.I was just there for the meat and ordered a steak medium rare with some gratin potatoes. Delicious flavoursome meat. A very generous 250grams. I was in heaven. Hear fish is amazing too."
4,"This place was great. I kinda had a mini overload. Fun for all ages young and old. The pieces they have are of historical, modern and imaginative. I'm  from Los Angeles California, and went to Hamburg for business. On a day I had off I came across this great gem of a tourist destination. I would like to come back and see new displays they come up with."
4,"My long ambition to get onto more submarines is finally coming to fruition. I've seen 2 in a month! My fascination with these relics of the cold war stems mainly from enjoying ""The Hunt for Red October"" so much. U-434 is a Soviet vessel dating from 1976. She is a Tango-class (NATO designation) attack boat, armed with 24 torpedoes. Powered by 3x 5200 shp 6 cylinder diesels, she was, I believe, the largest non-nuclear submarine in service at the time. A German businessman thought it would be a good idea to buy her for around EUR1M in 2002, and she was transported back from Russia for a further EUR1M and now lies in Hafen City. Admission is around EUR12 with an extra EUR3 for the guided tour, which ou can have in English. I highly recommend the extra tour as you get to see areas of the boat (command room etc.) that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. Sadly, as she was still in active service as a training boat until 5 years ago, the Ruskies removed quite a bit of equipment from her before she was sold. Therefore, you won't be plotting a firing solution as the torpedo computer has gone, along with sonar and communications. For the most part though this is as authentic as it gets. One ping only."
2,"Boyfriend and I are from America visiting Hamburg - If you're looking for something fast, cheap, and decent (taste wise) then this is a good spot. The food is definitely filling. We got the chicken durum. It wasn't anything to write home about...given the fact that we didn't have time, we wanted something quick. Would I go back again? Only if I was in a time crunch and needed to eat something quick and not to mention really cheap too! Not my favorite but not bad either. Also, not sure the customs in the area, but the same person that prepared our sandwich (without gloves) also handled our money and gave us change back without cleaning hands."
4,"This was the most amazing food I tasted in months! The hejpapa-crew didn't pay me for saying this  they just surprised me with quality food, best coffee (as good as kopiba coffee) and very good service. People, you should come here.Last not least, they have free WLAN."
4,"Although I had I pretty bad flu since the week before, I couldnt resists to join this event. Even though it appeared to be my first night as the Qype City Night host. So after all I joined the group around twentyhundret-and-a-bit: a bunch of more than 25 heads, that made their way to the GOLDEN, a place being criticized in november last year by myself in a pretty harsh but discussable way. Therefore I was pretty excited how both - the restaurantsowner and the qype community - would reflect on the upcoming event. Bearing a pretty poor stomach for almost a week in mind, I decided to choose from the menu, beginning with a chinese mushroom soup with chicken. Great choise! Delicious and tasty. Then there was some Dim Sums and in the end another shark-fin-soup (what-so-ever the english equivalent may be called). Please refer to both english and german feedbacksregarding the GOLDEN. As I dont like to edit my german comment from november `06, I have to get the GOLDEN five stars and two-thumbs-up from this end. That night was awesome! Thanks to Mr. Wong."
4,The Strandperle is for lots of people living in Hamburg a kind of a famous café. They are right. It is really beautiful.It is directly situated at the Elbe and visitors have really a great view at this river. You may watch the huge ships passing by while you are having a coffee or you are enjoying your breakfast.A small beach is directly in front of the caféThe café is very special and you will find lots of young people spending their time here. Lots of people in the twenties and thirties go there to meet friends or to relax.The atmosphere is amazing. When you go there simply to have coffee and to relax it often may happen that people start a conversation without knowing you at all. This is the result of such a comfortable atmosphere. Everybody is relaxed and life is beautiful again.The service is very friendly and professional.It is really worth going there and enjoy this place.
3,"Had to wait a while as it was super busy, but once we bit into our burgers, it all made sense. The meat was the finest we've tasted in a burger, ever, period. Chips nothing to write home about."
4,"Cozy interior, outdoor seating, very nice staff and relaxed atmosphere. And most importantly - delicious food!! We've tried 4 different dishes so far and they were all really high quality and very well made!"
3,"This is a  fine restaurant. The ambience is classes and I especially love the fact that the coat hangers are right at the table. Although the owner is Turkish he managed to create a really nice environment that actually felt like it were French. My one complaint is our server. It was my grandfathers birthday and what the server did was, that he HANDED the champagne glasses. That's right, he didn't set them down on our table as it's usually done. In addition, he had no clue of what a server is supposed to do. He just stood at our table for two minutes straight before asking us what we would like to order. Anyway the food was fabulous. I had the snails and the Fillet cafe de Paris. It is quite expensive but definitely worth it."
3,"Kartoffelkeller was a great place to warm up after spending a cold day exploring Hamburg. Situated underground, there are cellar vibes that are offset with candles everywhere and cutesy decor. The menu is, unsurprisingly, potato heavy so there was plenty for a vegetarian to chose from. I ended up going either the potato soup, which was a welcome surprise because it was served in a small pot with a little candle underneath. We also went with potato pancakes as a starter. The pancakes were crispy and served with sweet jam that made them a better dessert than starter but they were great, none the less. The only reason my review is 4 stars and not 5 is that Kartoffelkeller was a bit expensive for having a potato heavy menu. Being flagged as touristy and in a tourist district that isn't too surprising but worth noting. Overall, I would certainly go again for the food and experience."
3,Price is a little steep at 9 euro but it does provide for a couple hours of an iinteresting audio guided tour of Hamburg history in your language.  Start on the middle floor and turn left after going up the first flight of stairs.   This will start you at the beginning of Hamburg and will then take you around up until around 1900.  The 20th century is on the lower floor and the period of world war 2 is somewhat hidden below that.  (That area in particular needs narration and better information on Hamburg's history during that time).
4,This is a great place to go to relax and have couple of cocktails in summer. It really shines when the weather is great and you can take of your shoes. It's a bit crowded so you may have to wait till you get a place to crash. Mojitos they make are awesome!
3,"Ate here twice.  Had the kuzu sis and left very satisfied and full.  The dish came with many sides of salad, rice, roasted peppers, sauces erc.  The lambe kenob itself came fresh and piping hot.  The counter staff remind of the soup nazi on Seinfeld but the table server was very polite and friendly.  On my second visit, I tried a donair which tasted  very clean."
4,"I love visiting the Central Park in the summer. Classified a beach club, the Central Park has just about anything you'd expect from a beach club, but without the waves. Sand, beach chairs, table tennis, grill catering, popsicles, tall glasses of Weizen and evening shows. The prices at the grill are moderately alright, they serve a good cup of coffee and an excellent Flammkuchen! The Central Park is open until 23:00 in the summer (as a matter of fact, it's open only in the summer) and is pretty full up until the last minute, especially on the hot summer weekends. My favorite time to to is on a workday evening or a Sunday afternoon. Recommended as a nice alternative to, well, everything else in the Schanze, a nice place to kick back with some friends, have a light lunch/dinner and drink some beer.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=qqjR…"
4,"The food and service were really good! We had a little problem with the extra BBQ sauce on spare ribs, they apologised and brought a new one (even we finished most of the plate)! Really nice attitude!"
2,Charming restaurant on the Shanze. I had the Trucker schnitzel (featuring two fried eggs) and just about managed to finish it - very tasty. The decor of the old Apothecary adds a nice atmosphere and its particular warm and cosy in cold weather with the hot water pipes lining the edge of the room.
4,"It was a perfect place to drink a glass of wine leaving work! The selection of wine is really good and huge,  and the location is original, with a lot of flare... I only can recommend it!"
4,"The first time I had the avocado sandwich. All I can say is ""Soooo delicious!"". Second time their house salad. And let's not forget their cakes!? Sooo good! Really friendly service, comfy atmosphere, delicious food. Will come back!"
4,"Hallo an alle dort in Zwick, insbesondere Jaqualin lol! Sie wahrscheinlich nicht an mich erinnern, ich bin Kevin verwendet, um mit Ihnen in Cafe Wintergarten Arbeit an der Rothenbaumchaussee, war ich mit Ihnen zu arbeiten als Barkeeper lol!, ich kam gerade über Zwick und Ihr Foto online, nur eine kurze Anmerkung zu sagen Hallo und Sie immer noch aussehen wie Ihr Spaß haben:) Es war schon immer ein Ort zum Feiern: ') Kevin in Liverpool"
3,"Fantastic location and view, great drinks and  friendly staff. Go here on a weekday to skip the que and have more space. Viel Spaß!"
2,"Everytime i get non-german visitors we go to schweinske.it's an institution!! they have a wide choice of food, for very reasonable prices. Their salads are good, their hambrugers are good, their steaks and wurst are good! worth a try! Guten appetit ;)"
0,"I had a ice coffee and I was very disappointed. It did not taste well. The coffee was like water with a bit of coffee taste. Also I did not feel so well afterwards. Maybe it was bad luck, but there are much nicer places."
4,"This hidden gem is--hands down--the best Chinese & Dim Sum in Hamburg. The quality rivals my favorite places back in San Francisco. If you're looking for the Real Deal, this is it.The chefs/owners make their dim sum THEMSELVES--no deep-freezer factory-made dumplings here. And one tastes the difference immediately. We tried two types of Har Gao, Shu Mai, Rice-Crepe rolls, chicken feet, and wan tan soup. Everything was fresh and fantastic. Generous sizes, too.  The extensive menu features Hong Kong and Cantonese-style dishes. The decor is fun--strands of colorful lights complement the indoor waterfalls and gardens. Relaxed but nice.Can't wait to return and eat my way through the menu! :-)"
3,"Went for lunch on an overcast Tuesday afternoon. Not too busy and we got a table right after ordering. You order with the cashier, pay, and then sit and they bring out your food. I couldn't decide what to order and ended up with the pastrami special that was right in front of my face at the cashier. I asked for the sandwich without bread and over a salad and though confused at first that's exactly what I got! I'm impressed with the customization options here and that the kitchen got it right. The big salad with pastrami and a small bottle of water was 11.60, the ""menu"" price. I was expecting to be charged for the sandwich and the salad so this was a positive. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. Salad wasn't the freshest but it was decent and with plenty of pastrami. I think I was the only person there not eating a burger and fries so I'm assuming they are good too. If I remember well it was cash only, or cash and EC card only so be prepared!"
3,"Fresh fish, fast service, nice waiters, card or cash for pay. I didn't like Tom Yam, but rolls are tasty and look good."
0,"The building and the menu led us to Wasserschloss.  Made a reservation.  They didn't have the reservation but they made room for us.  That's when it all went badly.  Our server forgot to bring us bread, forgot to bring us wine, forgot to check on us once, and was surprised that we wanted the check so soon.  Terrible service ruined what could have been a great night to remember.  Stay away unless you want ok food with bland memories."
2,"Popular for dogs and the HSV. Different paths to choose from. Dogs should be on the line, this is normally ignored, and once in a while the controllers are out and about.Near by is Lüther Park and its beautiful church. The area has cafes which I will notice for the next time"
3,"I went there for lunch and ate one of the day's specials - a plate with rice, salad and turkey meat with vegetables. The food was tasty, cooked just right and the portion was exactly big enough. The line can get huge during lunch, however, so don't plan on a quick 5 minute trip here if you're going for lunch during the week."
3,The restaurant wears a pleasant atmosphere with nice aroma everywhere. I had pasta which i think was the best i had till date.
3,"Good Ol'e Jim Block. The ugly step child of Block House. Ok maybe not ugly but they're definitely related. Anyway, put that McDonalds burger down and head over to Jim Block because for about the same price you can have some real food! Everything is made right in front of you, it's fresh, it's fast, it's real, and most importantly, it's good.The only downside here, (at least at this location) is that there never seems to be enough seating. It is a rather small location which has very few seats. The lines are usually to the door if not out. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone who had their heart set on McDonalds or Burger King."
2,On a nice sunny day its a good place to walk along the Elbe or to sit and watch the ships go by. you can also take a ferry over to Finkenwerder town on the other side of the river.
3,"I have had many a doner in many a German city, but I am putting it out there - this is the best. I was guided here by a Turkish employee at my hotel, so I had high hopes. They were fulfilled. The meat is sliced fresh, and you have multiple meat choices. The flatbread is pressed and cooked fresh, meaning it's hot and delicious. There are many other choices too, from chicken wings to lamb. The restaurant itself has some tables and is a bit beat up, but fine. I subtract a star because you come out smelling like doner for a day thanks to all of the smoke and poor ventilation in the cooking area. But, it's worth it."
4,"We went here on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. We were greeted and looked after by very friendly and knowledgeable staff from our arrival to our departure. A lovely bowl of spicy krupuk crackers was a tasty appetiser followed by a whole steamed perch (Rotbarsch) with a light orange and ginger sauce, cooked to perfection and served with boiled rice. All very reasonably priced in a stylish, modern restaurant."
3,"When I see people eating from the ""to go"" cartons it makes it look so damn good."
3,"An Argentinian Steakhouse is what they are going for here. It's a great spot with indoor and outdoor seating.For our appetizer, we went with the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp didn't seem the freshest and it was drowning in sauce so it was just ok.For our entrees, we naturally went with the steaks that came with a side of a baked potato with sour cream on it. We tried to order the steaks medium rare but the steaks were more on the rare side. That was fine by me, the flavors of the steak still came out very well. The ambiance is really nice, as its a bit darker inside and they have candles on all the tables. There seemed to be a birthday going on at a couple of tables away from us. It was really cute, they turned up the music and served the birthday boy dessert with a whole bunch of sparklers in it. Not sure if the family arranged that or if the restaurant does that usually for birthdays but it was cute.At the end of your meal, its nice that that they also offer you a little after dinner drink. We had the amaretto, which was a great end to our meal and nice to know that it was included and was not extra.I will be back whenever I have a craving for steaks soon!"
4,"Reason for this report:1. Personally, I am a railway fan and own a digital model railway in scale 1:87 constructed by Märklin of Göppingen in Germany. 2. Men and women differ much from each other's. Whereas men are mostly interested in technical stuff, women are more interested in landscapes. In this report I want to invite every visitor to Hamburg to go and see the ""Miwula"" as the Mini Wonderland call themselves. Additionally, I shall give a few tips. Owner:At the end of the 90s the Braun brothers Gerret and Freddy of Hamburg had the idea to build the world's largest model railway and to show it to the public against entrance fees. As they both seem to be ""crazy guys"", they have not only tried to be the largest, but also to amend unique highlights. Unfortunately I don't know any of them, I have seen them only on TV.Until today, their company has grown to as much as 100 employees.Site:The ""Miwula"" is located in the ""Speicherstadt"" (= storage quarter where old storage houses are located) on the 4th level of Block D on the street Kehrwieder #2. It can best be reached by public transport. The subway station ""Baumwall"" on the yellow line ""U3"" is only 10 minutes walk away from the ""Miwula"". For car fans, there are some pay parking lots available, which are quickly overcrowded on the weekend or during the holiday season. Waiting hours:Since the ""Miwula"" has opened in 2001, it has become one of the main attractions in downtown Hamburg. As it is only possible to see something if there are not more than about 100 people inside, the Miwula Management has decided not to let more than these 100 people inside. If there are more visitors, they will have to wait until other people have left again. On weekends and during the holiday season, it may happen that you wait more than an hour.VERY GOOD: as a spezial serviced the ""Miwula"" offers on ist website statistics about the waiting hours of the past and predict the visitors of the next days including waiting hours. Usually, there are more visitors around lunch time. NICE: on the homepage you can also find suggestions where to go elsewhere in Hamburg. What a pity that they have only two suggestions.Opening hours:Daily from 9.30 AM until 6.00 PM, on Tuesday until 9 PMOn the weekend from 8.30 AM until 8 PM. Especially in the evening hours the ""Miwula"" is highly flexible, also during special event like the Harbor Anniversary or the Football World Championship. Entrace fees:Adults EUR 9 (~£ 6 or $ 11.50), Children under 16y EUR 4 (~£ 2.70 or $ 5), Children smaller than 1 meter are free. They have a variety of rebates for seniors and groups and even yearly subscription cards. For a family with two kids the total entrance fee would be EUR26. I personally believe that it's worth its money. About the Traings and landscape:The ""Miwula"" only shows trains in scale 1:87 (which in Germany is called H0 = half nill), most trains go on the Märklin digital system with 16V AC power. In the US contruction part, however, the trains go on DC power system. Most visitors won't realize this fact, however this construction makes it impossible for the trains to switch between these two systems. On the other hand this is quite realistic, as you will hardly find US trains in Europe and vice versa.Every 15 minutes the lights will turn from white to red, then blue until they are switched off for a few minutes to simulate the night. Interestingly, the constructors have also achieved that the train and car traffic is reduced in volume during this time. It is a very realistic simulation of the night & day changes.Phase 1 of the construction reflects Southern and Central Germany and was constructed within eight months. On the 300 square meters there are 3 kilometers of tracks with 450 switches. 230 trains with 2,400 coaches roll over the layout. Already in Phase 1 the constructor were very successful to implement small scenes with much love for details. In one area you see prisoners escaping from jail, in another a loving couple in the forest, and yet in another some strike activities in a coal mine. As a further technical highlight, there are many model cars in the same scale driving through the many streets. It is always big fun when the fire engines get out to address a burning house or castle. Quickly after finishing the first Phase, the ""Miwula"" got quickly known and attracted many visitors. In November 2002, Phase 2 was opened showing Hamburg and the North German Coast line. You see the separate subway systems, street demonstrations, a Techno Move and many other fabulous details. One of the most important models is the making of the Hamburg Football stadium. Even the large screens in scale 1:87 work and can be illuminated in whatever direction. Ín December 2003 Phase 3 was finished: America. Here you can find Las Vegas with all its lights, models of the famous Big Boy - the largest ever built steam engine, you see temperature announcements on the highway in °F (instead of °C), and on Area 51 some"
3,"We did the English tour at 10am today, was great and very entertaining. Most was in English so it was easy to understand (a couple of things were in German but it didn't take away from the experience). There were a few laughs, a few screams and all out fun. If you don't speak German it's essential that you book in for one of the English tours.Only negative was the fun photo at the beginning didn't work and it took almost halfan hour for us to get another one taken"
4,"For authentic and traditional northern German cuisine and ambiance, Brodersen takes the cake. This place attracts more of an older crowd, but that shouldn't stop you young folk. This is definitely a restaurant that you appreciate for upholding tradition and its' sophistication. The interior design has a nautical scheme, and it creates a very intimate and romantic setting because of the dim lighting. If you want to avoid the romance and are looking for a more casual and relaxed setting, sit outside!I ordered the Schölle - Büsumer Art, which is with the Nordsee Krabben. Being a potato-maniac, the highlight of my meal was the Bratkartoffeln (roast potatoes). However, everything else was absolutely perfectly delicious. I have no complaints. Only conflict I faced at Brodersen was that I didn't know how to properly use the seafood utensils and how to de-bone my Schölle. But now, I do!Brodersen would be at the top of my list if I was visiting Hamburg. I would highly recommend taking visiting travelers and families here for dinner. It's food, atmosphere and design create a warm and lovely atmosphere. You'd want to share this experience with others!Side note: I found this place extremely comparable to a restaurant in Montecito, CA - Stella Mare. So if you're ever in town, check it out ~"
4,"Handy location, homey atmosphere and decent service! I ordered Scholle Finkenwerder Art mit Bratkartoffeln und Salat, which is whole fried plaice (""Finkenwerder style) served with roast potatoes and salad. My boyfriend ordered Labskaus, which is an old, traditional sea farer's dish made from potatoes, beef and beetroot, served with gherkin, beetroot and rollmop. (It is completely gluten free!) We had Zabaione (warm marsalacreme) as the desert. All the food are tasty and well prepared. Very nice place to go if u r searching for northern German taste/gluten free restaurant!"
1,"Nice location! The food is actually not bad. I got the hamburg special which was panfish with potatoes. It was pretty delicious. One of my friends got the currywurst and it was massive and looked pretty good. I would suggest getting the currywurst if you are ever here. We were here to watch germany play during one of the world cup games. The place was busy but the service was pretty quick. One massive complaint I have is the server gave me an attitude. They had the game on a projector and the game kept cutting off and the picture quality was just awful. I was my phone out (mind you it was my US phone and it doesn't have service in germany) I took it out to show some pictures to my friend and the server came over and singled me out and told me not to use my phone because it was interfering with the quality of the picture on the projector. I was the only person in the entire bar she told this to, even though my phone doesn't receive any service in Hamburg. Not cool!The food deserves three stars i had to remove a star because of the service."
3,"I had lunch here today and immensely enjoyed it. The quality of the seafood is excellent and they cook it very well. My Pfannfisch (which I was told was a local Hamburg dish) with pan fried potatoes and a mustard sauce was excellent. Light fluffy and flaky fish with excellent potatoes and the sauce was also quite tasty (missing a bit of intensity for a mustard sauce). My oyster entree was also great and fresh. It was a bit expensive at €21 for 6 oysters but I had to try it as I have not had any oysters since arriving in Germany :-) I think I will keep looking for good oysters but it is not easy to find.This place is certainly not cheap and lunch for two with two courses and mineral water was around €80. I think you pay for the view here which many of the restaurants in the area do not have.I would come back here for the seafood but will explore loads of other places nearby also, that serve seafood (there is a line of seafood restaurants in this area so you have plenty of choice)."
4,"AMAZING!!!pros:veganaffordableamazing servicewonderful atmospherecons:noneI ordered the Barbecue burger and I actually ended up ordering a second one because it was so deliciousit had a wonderful ""cream"" like sauce as well as a tons of barbecue sauce that was super duper yummy!!the pizza was melty, had a wonderful sauce & it really had fresh ingredients + toppings!! I can't wait to come back to Hamburg and come again!"
3,"I like that sushi/japanese place.i live just around the corner now! Since they dont have a wide choice of 'sushi menus' (a pre-selected variety of sushi/maki/sashimi), it would be wise here to order one huge dish for everyone. Whenever i am there with my friends, we try to pick a bit from everything and share the entire plate, or else each one of us would be stuck with a 6 piece roll of the same kind of sushi. And their salads are really good, i specially love the sauce! I havent tried the soup, but i have been told it is also good! I am not a saki expert, but when i had it, i liked it!i liked it even more when i got drunk.We had once ordered 2 sakis (as we were 2 persons there) and the waitress got us two 'kettles' of saki, instead of two glasses. That was A LOT for me! but i enjoyed it :) I will definitely be back there soon..."
3,"A great roof-top bar in Hamburg, in the very center of the city. The very top level is open, so absolutely fabulous during the summer. The place is a bit pricey, but it's worth going there for a beer or a cocktail. In the evening, you might need to book a table.I highly recommend this bar, it's absolutely magic!"
3,Food was good not great! However the ambience was some what comfortable. Staff was kind and prompt.
4,The restaurant has more than just Vietnamese food. We had tasty Thai style curry dishes - a welcome break from wurst. Prices are good and the waiter is attentive.
4,"I really loved this place. It is cooler than probably any bar i've ever been to in london and it was really cheap with really friendly fast service. The best bit about it is that you can play extreme table football in the back and then when you're tired head into the bedroom for a quick snooze. There's even a blanket, and no one seems to mind if you do sleep, unlike london where you can get chucked out of a club for closing your eyes. Very chilled and very nice."
2,Good to go with a friend. The cheapest Hendricks gin and Tonic I have found in Hamburg major plus! Shabby chic all the way and a really varied mix of clients.
3,Great place for a Sunday beer. In the summer at least!
0,"Bad food. We, a group of 4, tried 3 appetizers, 4 main dishes and 2 deserts. All was really bad."
0,"Just my personal opinion: Outstandingly rude security in front, truly incredible. And then once inside, nothing really worth writing home about. If it were up to me, I would go literally anywhere else!"
3,"Looks like a really cool bar, and it was really crowded after 9. I love highball here, basil and New York sour one. But I don't like they allow smoking inside, especially I am not a smoker. When I got home, my hair my clothes my everything smells like cigarettes. Minus one star for that."
2,Not the best Hard Rock experience ever. Had to wait over an hour to get a table - on a Monday night in April? This was not high tourist season and it was midweek but there seemed to be an issue with service and the speed of the staff. Eventually got a table 90 mins later but the meal was very slow in being served too. Were they caught out and were short staffed? Who knows but it was 4 hours after we arrived that we finally left. Not good enough. Food was usual Hard Rock standard and no complaints about that but the service was not what you would expect.
0,"I have been to this place today after reading so many positive reviews about it. I had to drive all the way around 40 minutes on a rainy day. To make it short: the location at Steindamm 58 isn't the best or worst either, at least it didn't bother me at all. Even though my first impression was negative right after i entered this place, I queued up like others for the pos register. I ordered a so called jumbo durum for 5.00 euros even, and a beverage for 1.75 euros. I hat to stay in the queue to receive my order. While waiting I had the chance to observe that previously prepared various meat products were unsavorily displayed to customers despite being partially spoiled. But I stayed in the line, because the durums were allegedly prepared fresh. Finally it was my turn to get my order. The meal was a huge portion of a freshly baked  thin flatbread some cut of grilled ground meat with mixture of a salads. The meat wasn't hot enough, some parts  were not evenly cooked, some other still raw. I really was hungry, but couldn't swallow the first bite and had to immediately leave that horrible fast food place! Honestly I was extremely disappointed and wouldn't waste my time again, so to speak not even under any given circumstances..."
4,"This place is so good! It's also rather popular. Ignore the queue of people waiting in the doorway and make straight for a waiter. They'll furnish you with some beers whilst you inevitably have to wait a while for a table. I went here on a Tuesday night and we drank 2 beers during the wait, so... it's busy. If you can get over this the food is served quite quickly, and the meat here is so good, it's worth it. Delicious lamb kebabs, cutlets, and minced skewers, served with great chips or rice, and zatziki. It's basic greek, but authentic, and delicious. And they show the football. I'll deinitely be coming back!"
0,"We made a reservation for 6 people at 6pm. We arrived and from the beginning, the female server had a major attitude. Everything we said she had to roll her eyes at us and shrug her shoulders. In fact, one of the people in our party asked for a dark beer and she replied: ""I don't know."" Again, my colleague asked for the darkest, heavier beer they had and rolling her eyes she said ""Pilsner"". If you know German beer, that is as light beer as it gets; so she recommended the total opposite. I lived in Germany and was letting it slide. She kept with the attitude while we order our food. Some of the members in my party have never been there and asked a few questions about the menu. She just kept acting as we were a waste of her time. When she asked me for my choice, I finally said to her: ""are you ok?"" And she, rolling her eyes one again, said: ""Ja, why?"" And I finally said, ""because since we walked in this restaurant you have had a very sarcastic and nasty attitude and you can now drop it."" She was in shock that I confronted her. After she walked away, the members of my party said: ""I thought it was me who noticed and attitude but I did not want to say anything."" But I did. And here is the deal: The server does not know that some if the members in my dinner party come to Hamburg every week, sometimes 4 to 5 times a month with different colleagues from work and we recommend to each other places to eat. In fact, I thought the food was quite mediocre and I've had much better Germany food in other locations nearby. I will definitely not recommend this restaurant to any of my colleagues any longer and personally, will never step one foot in this place again. (Better food: Restaurant Franziskaner near the lake in the center of town)."
2,"The Omas Breakfast comes with a lot of cheese (some a little weird and others like the brie a very welcome sight on my plate.)Bread rolls, Meat, Croissants, fruit, juice, a bevvy of spreads and a flute of champers also accompany the breakfast.Plenty of food but a little heavy on the stomach and no good if your not a fan of cheese and bread for breakfast.Was a little disappointed with my boiled egg being boiled much too hard... but other then that the service was quick and the price good."
4,"This was the only Italian restaurant that was open late, so we decide to give it a try, and I'm really happy we did. I forgot to post this so I don't remember all of the dood we ate, but I do remember how fantastic the grilled calamari was. Everything was absolutely delicious."
0,"Sub-par food at high prices, snobby owners more interested in joking around than dealing with the customers queuing. To me, this is another one of the many operations riding the vegan trend for maximum cash and giving the vegan movement a bad rep."
3,"Really solid coffee bar that has just about everything you would expect. It was just across the road from my hotel and I fancied a coffee so I popped in and was happy with the experience.  The only downside (missing part) of this place is they had no filter coffee at all, it was completely espresso based.  Still I went with a flat white and sat at the window and watched the world go by. There was a good view and the service was friendly. It is styled as most coffee shops are these days. Fairly minimalist in its approach with a less is more attitude to furnishings. They of course have lots of wood finishing , stone finishing , big tables and a fancy (la marazocco) traditional espresso machine.The main thing is the flat white I had tasted great, the service was good and I spent a peaceful and relaxed 15 mins people watching in a nice location."
4,"Cox was recommended by a local. That's clearly the best way. It's a beautify old building. High ceilings, glass open frontage plenty of natural light. No outdoor seating.  They don't need to be trendy, they are intimate and the food speaks for itself (in both a classic and classy way without attitude). I was brought bread with butter and a salt shaker to start. To begin I chose the cold roast beef with fried potatoes and not sure what dressing but oh wow ! Even at this stage it's clear that if I lived locally I would be a regular. This is where you bring a date to impress her (if she's a foodie) trust me it will impress! As I wait for my main I try another piece of bread yes, the salt does enhance the flavour. Also my very attentive waitress steps outside and charmingly slouches against the door frame to peruse the street for a moment before turning and coming back in. I really really like it here! I know I'm not writing a novel here but as I sip my German rose while sitting alone it's impossible not to drink in the atmosphere. The wine is delicious btw. Esp in this humid heat. My main was essentially Fish w beets but the menu listing was more eloquent.  When I was having trouble deciding on my main. When I asked her favourite the waitress said she liked this item because of its freshness. Very apt.  I'm not stopping there. (Btw I Never do 3 courses of dinner!) As I sit here enjoying my own thoughts I notice the couple in the (frosted) window table holding hands. Take note men, That's where you want to sit with your romantic dates. Dessert, well I'm not really a fan I just got carried away. The chocolate sauce and vanilla custard I think it was Accompanying were really delicious. The Tort was nice. Just not really my thing. Although I enjoyed the pastry casing in which it was served and the nutty texture. This was one of my stand out dining experiences in Germany. Highly recommended!"
4,"Sure they started a bit shaky, but after a few months of working through the kinks and finding some great cooks these guys nailed it. Perfect food, casual attitude, good service, and good location. A+"
2,It's at least interesting. Every meal is potato and something. Was an OK meal but I won't be rushing back.
2,"Interesting concept than the one where you have to take off your shoes if you want to eat! Fear not though, you don't have to do this in the entire place. As part of a group we were offered a sitting area with low tables and stools laid out on oriental carpets, only area where shoes off are indeed required! Be geared up with funky socks, as it may make the entire experience more exciting! :)I'm not a vegetarian but always enjoy the variety of food and mixed vegetables on offer. 9EUR for a falafel with chips, side salad and a glass of wine, I say pretty cheap experience for lovely & much filling food!Why the 3 stars? Although all the staff was really lovely, the service was pretty slooooow. None of us really managed to eat at the same time. One tip: don't order red wine! But again, I'm French, my expectations may be pretty high :)"
2,"Ho-Hum!! Standard fare. I experienced better...the wait staff is funny, sort of local Mafia wannabes (or maybe real...;-). If you watched the Sopranos you know what I mean...he..he...enjoy!"
4,"A great little cosy cafe auf dem Kiez to hang out on Saturday or Sunday afternoons in St. Pauli. Located in between the Reeperbahn and Millentorn-Stadion, in whats slowly becoming one of my favorite parts of town, this cafe is off the beaten path enough that there are few tourists and mostly locals hanging out in a relaxed atmosphere. Staff is friendly and after a while you feel like a regular. Prices at Mimosa are very fair, you can easily get a drink and a piece of cake for less than 5 Euros. When you consider that all the cakes are made and baked in the back (it smells quite good on days they are making jam), this is a steal- and they are delicious to boot (Im a fan of the chocolate-poppy-cherry cake). The sandwiches are also great and are a good option for a light lunch."
2,"Very friendly staff, they made us feel very welcome and we were even drinking shots together.The starter was great, the overall fish quality was very good. However, they serve the fish with very flavoured sauces which don't suit the great fish quality. We've recommended them to serve the sauce on the side rather than on top of the fish.Also a bit expensive, 2 people - 100€ for menu and bottle of wine."
4,"Went here the other day with some fellow english speaking tourists for some food and a few drinks. We really had no idea what we'd find inside, but we were in the neighborhood and hungry enough to eat almost anything at that point so we just went in. I'm so glad we did because the food was absolutely delicious! The cocktails were also really good and the service was great as well. Our waiter spoke english really well and was nice enough to recommend some great drinks and burgers to us. If you're ever in the area and up for eating some great food in relaxing atmosphere, you should try Down Under."
3,"I was near the Alster Lake on a nice Sunday afternoon and wasn't sure where to go for lunch. I found Jim Block to be right near the lake, and there was a huge crowd. I went in, and ordered my burger  meal combo which comes with a drink and fries. I must say, the burger here was simply amazing. I also took their original Mayo, which was so thick and creamy. The fries, the mayo and the burger was the perfect combo for a nice Sunday afternoon meal. They have seating both indoors and outdoors. I'd suggest sitting outdoors. The ambience is nice for a good meal.The staff are also courteous."
3,"The ambience is very nice, but the food is a bit bland, compared to other vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. But everything is very fresh and nicely served. On Saturday at lunch the place was crowded, people were even waiting outside to get a seat."
4,"Probably my favourite cafe in Hamburg. Outstanding coffee, roasted in-house and prepared with skill and love. The food is super tasty and creative. Out back there's a great view over one of the canals and the interior is very stylish. Top recommendation for specialty coffee lovers."
4,"Sehr stylischer Laden und die Pizza ist auch lecker.Die Pizza ist zum selberkonfigurieren und dann am besten draußen essen und ein bischen Menschen schaun, das ist auf St. Pauli ja immer eher unterhaltsam."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised today when I was brought in by my Qype colleagues to this asian looking little gem called the Loving Hut. Me and my 2 words of German were glad to see we were going into familiar grounds: an English name, surely an English menu, right? Yes! I ordered the Curry which was pretty nice which came with either soup or spring rolls as appetizers for a mere EUR7. I'm not vegan in any way although I like the concept. In fact I could consider myself a 'vegan-virgin' before today (I really do love my beef burgers) but the dish was really tasty, definitely filling and left me wanting to try a new one sometime soon. Judging by one of the Qypers below, we got the best spot in da' place too!! The one and only round table in the back!"
3,"This place deserves four solid stars for its unbeatable location only: Hirschpark is one of the most enjoyable and pretty parks in Hamburg. And what can be better to take a stroll after fulfilling and hearty brunch on Sunday afternoon! The brunch itself was not outstanding: you will find a standard selection of warm and cold dishes, not too much and not too little. The bread selection was a bit disappointing, with no wholemeal buns selection, to which you get used to so quick while living in Germany. On the other hand a really good selection of deserts. Interior is very old fashioned, you absolutely feel that you are in a traditional Landhaus. Therefore a lot of old customers. Prices are not cheap: you'll pay 19 eur, drinks excluded. Keep in mind that tables for brunch are booked quickly. Would I suggest this place? Yes, if you want a quiet meal, opportunity to chat and no hassle. There was my mom, my boyfriend and me brunching together - now you got the idea :)"
2,"The beer is the star here. To my palate, it's distinctive across the three brews offered, each having a very aromatic, herbal quality. The food is solid German brew house fare with a twist. There's a curry-laden Thai soup that's delicious and a German ""tapas"" plate featuring mini-schnitzels, rõsti and wurst. The canal-side setting is quite nice."
4,"Crispy duck is so good here!! I've only ever had takeout, while staying at the Park Hyatt in the same mall complex, but they are prompt and the food is delicious. I keep going back thinking I'll try something else, but seats get the same dish.For foreigners, it is cash only (no international cards)."
3,"Always busy, order and take a buzzer back to your table and wait 5 minutes. Collect your own utensils. No table service. The food is pretty good and for 6 Euros, a good deal. You could do a lot worse in the area.."
2,"I had such high hopes for Cafe Mexico but alas it was a bit of a let down. The service is ok, very nice, even though our server was slow with the drinks and spilled a whole plate of creamy enchiladas all over our coats. That was something I'll never forget, I don't think my coat will either. The menu seemed to have a lot of choices but in actuality it did not. It just a lot of repetition and white space. Mexican food is one of my favorites so I knew what to expect and I was not expecting what was put down in front of me. Once I got my food, it was extremely cold, as if they had the kitchen in another building and walked it over in the dead of winter. Even though they told me mine would take a few minutes longer because it had to cook longer it was actually one of the first dishes to come out. I might give this place another chance but I am not rushing back there anytime soon. I will just have to hang my sombrero and wait until I come across a real, authentic Mexican experience."
4,I was at this qrito last Sunday and I must say I was impressed. I have been having serious withdraws from Mexican food (I am from San Diego) I could never find a place. I ordered a carnitas burrito and filled it up with all kinds of fresh fillings. It's pretty much a Mexican subway and I like that style very much. Heading there today to get a second taste!!
3,Ordered the thämer burger with fries and 2 half pints of beers. Can't get better than that!
4,"Hello Friends, welcome welcome welcome! The place looks lovely, the handmade tables are gorgeous and so is the bar. Nice job. It's sparse of course, but you'll grow into that gigantic space soon enough. It takes time...til then: The food is really good. I love that I can have a burger medium instead of charred like back home (it's ground STEAK), I love that the emphasis is on the meat and not the bread. I love that there's a roll of paper towels right on the table for me to wrap myself in so I don't get covered in food. I love that a real someone cut each and every fry on my plate. I love love love the pickles that bossman makes himself. FINALLY DECENT PICKLES! I love a ton of ice in my cola, and big German beer.Even the NY cheesecake is alright ;) I'm so glad you're here! I am just down the street if you ever need anything, cup of sugar, directions etc..."
4,"I've been to this place when I visited Germany.I've tried couple of other Indian restaurants but shikara is no match with those..I loved the food here, it's fresh and tasty, ambience is great and service is excellent Feel free to ask chef or manager about the daily specials or what suits your taste."
3,"I've been there only once on a sunday.the place was packed, but we did manage to find a table.The waiters are friendly, but not too friendly. which is great in such places.The food is really good, and not expensive.However on sunday its VERY loud, a lot of families, children, babies, running around and shouting at the top of their lungs!"
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (4/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
3,"If you are looking for upperscale German dining, you'll probably like this. The food was a bit funky for us Americans, but the quality seemed very good. I had the pork steak. The flavors were delicious, but a bit rich and salty. However, I think it just may be cultural difference. The view is of course amazing. The staff was super friendly and spoke English well. That's a big plus in Hamburg. We were going to a concert and wanted to eat close by. Well worth it!"
2,"I wasn't really impressed with this place. I figured I had to get a burger if I was going to be in Hamburg, but the meat lacked seasoning, all the fresh ingredients were cold and the cheese wasn't melted. These are some of the most important parts about a good burger. Also, they don't accept American credit cards so make sure you have cash. (I walked around for awhile looking for an ATM, that was fine!) The truffle mayo sauce is good and the ketchup is regular ketchup. The ""large"" fizzy water was pretty small in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend. I went in on a Sunday around 8:00 and sat right away since I was by myself. Service was pretty quick."
2,"Went here in January, on a saturday. place was more packed than a can of sardines! couldn't even reach the bar, getting to the restroom was almost out of the question, and actually, now that i remember, even getting into the bar itself was a pain. people standing in the doorway smoking. lol. I'm sure its nice when its not that busy, but if you happen to go when it is too busy, just run across the street to haus 73 and get cozy there."
3,"Being an Indian on a business trip to Hamburg, my joy knew no bounds when I came across Shikara which was close to the hotel in Altona. Just because of the Indian connection, there was an instant liking to this place when I walked in the first time.The staff is extremely courteous and made food as per our request even though it was not in the menu. The taste of the food again was made for our Indian tongues and we kept going back to the same restaurant every few days!Food - 8/10Ambiance - 9/10Staff - 10/10Value for money - 7/10 (Didn't matter much to me since I was on a business trip!)My suggestion for improvement: since I am from South India, I would love to see more South Indian dishes in the menu. Apart from that tiny rant, this restaurant is one of the best Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood and certainly worth a couple of visits for sure!"
4,"After a short wait to get a table, the breakfast was simply sensational. The coffee was good, orange juice was fresh, and the granola was delicious. I then had the avocado and eggs in toast with Pesto - delicious. Would definitely come back here."
3,"2 Euro party! This photo both takes the most fantastic pics for 2 Euros! Great way to start or end a party, either way you gonna look awesome. One down side, it's a dirty place!"
4,Just discovered this place tonight. Very good Pho soups and hot ginger tea. Staff very friendly. Prices also very reasonable. Great to have such a place in the Innenstadt.
4,"Absolutely love this place!! From the outside it looks a bit run down and you may be even turned off by it but once you step inside you won't regret it. It reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in New York with its dark wood paneling, red tablecloths, and Chinese artwork. The staff is extremely friendly and next to all the artwork you will notice several new clippings with regard to China Golden. That's right, they have been published in newspapers, magazines, and much more. The huge menu has everything you could imagine and more. The prices are a bargain for what you get and what you get is a feast. The smells, the taste, and the atmosphere are to die for. I can't recommend 1 dish since I love them all as if they were my children but just trust me and stop by China Golden and see for yourself."
3,"Visit this Starbucks just to look up and out.  Beautiful location, ceiling and views.  That explains my four stars.  The service, prices and most everything else related to this, and most foreign Starbucks, are overrated.  Unless of course you are missing a taste and feeling from home (if you are US American).  Recommendation for Tourists: Go in, look, if you are willing buy a drink and go sit on the Binnenalster to enjoy people and boat watching.  If it is too cold, might as well stay inside and enjoy the ceiling.  If you have a taste for coffee, find a local place far away from Jungfernsteig. Far, far away."
4,"Great little cafe on Schanzenstr. The coffee tastes as good as the place looks from the outside, which is to say, very good."
3,"A very good place for a family meal for four. We came here early on a Saturday night and they were kind enough to find us a table as long we were were done by 8pm. So it's more or less Steak for four with ice-cream afterwards, you know what to expect and there are no real surprises. Nice location, well kept place."
3,"I like the ambiente very much, never eaten there though, only nachos and it was very average. The beer is shots are nice!"
3,"Nice coffee shop, really small place though. Dark, wood-heavy interior, friendly staff. homemade pastries, lunch menu. 1 hour free wifi via tMobile hotspot, charge your batteries, people, outlet costs .50 per hour extra! Cardamom & nutmeg shakers - you fancy, huh?"
2,"I was positively surprised by the many different dishes you can order, even though sometimes further detailed descriptions may help you figuring out what to eat. Waiters were friendly, what actually persuaded me into rating three stars is the fact that portions are a bit disappointing in terms of quantity and that people were loud, also payment with cash card is not supported, anyway i'm definitely going again! Dishes tasted really good."
4,"Probably the best pizza in Hamburg!Great lively place, crazy packed so the first challenge is to actually get a table here but if you manage to get it you're in for an experience. Great Italian menu but the pizza's are the highlights.The atmosphere is very lively dark with loud latin music mixed with communal and private tables."
3,"The museum itself is a nice museum with a lot of interesting things, but after seeing the miniature wonderland and the maritime museum, I had more than enough miniature buildings and boats. Only was able to stay 15 minutes before I couldn't take anymore of it."
2,"On the + side:- The restaurant is centrally located: Gansemarkt- Pizzas are affordable and gigantic (be ready to ask for your doggy bag)- There are daily extra dishes, which widen your options- Staff is friendly and attentive- There is a terrace, which is great on a sunny/warm day- There is a bar counter, so you could go for a drink or eat alone without feeling awkward- Good place for a bunch of friends to have a laugh or a family who wants to feed hungry kidsOn the - side:-It's one of those restaurants where the sound control is so wrong that it feels like you are in a canteen; it's ridiculously loud making a proper conversation challenging.-Ok pizzas are huge but when you really look at them, it's basically a huge crust of white flour with a bit of oil; if you put together the toppings, you realize that it's acually less than what a regular pizza would encompass...welcome to excess of starchy carbs and high glycemy...- I tried dark black pasta with seafood; pasta were overcooked (another canteen feeling) and seafood taste was covered by a way too heafty oil dressing...All in all, quite ok, I dont think I would recommand it though I wouldnt want to go back there eitherThere are better italians in town with better atmospheres"
4,"Ok, I'm not usually a Starbucks fan, but this location and place is awesome. The building and location are super, super, super. So pretty. As an American, I sometimes miss flavors from home. Sometimes it is lovely to taste a soy Chai Tea latte. Or banana bread. Or something that is loaded with chocolate and an insane amount of calories and just tastes American. What better way to enjoy those flavors than in a beautiful Altbau building right on the Alster?The barristas were--gasp!--friendly, seemed to have been well-versed in American culture.The secret is out--this is a great place to go to for a get-away from the stress of German life."
4,"If you like fine cocktails, a great variety of Whiskeys and a lot of other good beverages, this is the place for you. This bar has a touch of luxury and class, people do like to dress up when they come here. They also offer snacks, if you'd become hungry after the 3rd to 5th drink :)The staff is working in a pro-manner and is really friendly. I recommend reserving a table at the Bacardi Lounge."
3,"Food = awesome and that is my main motivation to come here. Service is hit or miss and when outside seating isn't possible, the berlin-hipster interior style isn't so much my thing. But if you're coming for the food, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a super hungry boy. You might need a starter then too, so I hear). Enjoy!"
4,"Gorgeous restaurant with a delightful staff. I had weinerschnitzel, which was two giant pieces fried perfectly along with the best german-fried potatoes I've eaten. I didn't care for the cucumber salad, but my wife's fish pot of three meats, sauce and veggies was delicious. We each got a soup, one crab one potato and they were fantastic.  Really enjoyed the meal here and would go back if we were staying longer!"
3,"Nice ambience and atmosphere; also friendly staff. Typical food selection chicken, Schnitzel, Currywurst and a bit of fish. The best place to start the night at Reperbahn having something to eat or drink. A bit more expensive than usually for this type of food, but due location it's worth it."
4,"Everything is probably ordered from oyster to Zander here, which lives in such a way in the water. In addition a spectacular view of the putting on maneuver of the England ferry comes. A beautiful interior arrangement, and evenly this view, invite to staying."
3,"Tiny little fish place. I had a mixed plate that was quite tasty. It's very ""mom and pop"" with just one lady doing all the work. Beware you will smell like fried fish if you dine in. Great for a light meal (by German standards!) and quick too, they also have takeaway options too."
0,"Confirmed yelp reservation was not accepted upon arrival.  Staff ""tried to call"", apparently absolving them from their commitment.  Argumentative rather than apologetic.  Not okay."
4,There are several of these along the S and U-Banh stations near Jungfernstieg but they are all of consistently high quality. You can't beat the value of these - particularly the jumbo curry combo. You get a whole meal for ~$4-5 USD at the current exchange rate - incredible by any measure in Europe. Service is ridiculously quick but is cash only - a problem for those of you getting by using a travel card. This place served as lunch and dinner one day when I was particularly desperate - I didn't regret it one bit.
2,We were there during the happy hour. Our sahne cocktails were very very sweet and probably had no alcohol. It was not as expected at all and that is the 3 stars. Although their ambience is quite nice & the service is fast & good!
1,I had a family brunch here on Sunday.Good thing is that they have lego and toys for children to play near the entrance.
4,"Gaaaanz lecker und preiswert!!!! Ich stimme zu was die anderen geschrieben haben. Wer Kartoffeln essen will, geh einfach ein da man viel drauf auswahlen kann :-)"
3,"Great food but a bit too crowded. The system there is really good, though: You get a streetname assigned to your order which is then called out when your food is ready to be picked up. No starbucksy name-guessing on both ends. The burgers are good, but not really spectacular. Too bad you can't upgrade the Pulled Beef burger to include more meat. Good value for the money, though. Not sure why they need plates, though. That being said, it definitely gives Jim Block definitely its own flair."
2,"If you have to kill an hour to 90 minutes because you arrive early Sunday morning and the hotel doesn't have your room ready, you can visit just so you don't sit in the lobby.  Check out the airport miniatures,  it is really cool.  Kids will love the place for sure but i wouldn't go out of my way to visit unless you just need to kill time as I previous stated."
1,"I walked past this place a number of times, I've never been bothered to go in but always had an inconscious desire of having a meal here. Maybe what my inconscious was trying to tell me wasn't something like you should try it but, at the contrary, something like leave it. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this place, for two simple reasons: food isn't particularly tasty and it's a bit too expensive (but probably not for the area). Don't really remember much about service or decorations, but honestly who cares if the food isn't good. So the recommendation would be to eat here only if you are really really, really hungry. Too hungry even for a 30 seconds walk to Grindelalle, were you can find something better and cheaper for sure."
4,"My husband and I bought combo tickets to the zoo and the aquarium (60 euros altogether), and after three hours enjoying the zoo, I wasn't sure that I had the stamina to tour the aquarium. I'm so glad that I powered through, because it was even better than the zoo! My husband does not speak or read any German, and my competency is slightly above elementary, but we found that more of the signage at the aquarium is in both English and German than the signage in the zoo. Even though the name clearly reads ""tropics/aquarium,"" I was expecting to see only water creatures. Wrong: this is where the lemurs and lizards and snakes live, too! I was expecting to see the lemurs in the zoo portion, but no, they are the first exhibit one encounters in the ""tropics/aquarium"" part. I loved the design of the space: the maze-like way one moves from exhibit to exhibit, the seemingly hand-written and hand-drawn signs, and the neat way that the environs of the smaller animals are presented in wooden cabinets as in the Renaissance cabinet of curiosities. Imagine an aquarium and zoo presented in a venue like Sir John Sloane's Museum in London, and that's very close to what one encounters here. If we had been pressed for time and could have only done one venue, I would choose here over the actual zoo, it's so good."
3,"A nice spot for lunch or dinner and will be even better once the new Elbe Philharmonic Hall opens up,.  Carl is actually several restaurants sharing the same building - casual bistro, a more formal brasserie, and a private room and bar downstairs.  Went here for a group dinner at the Brasserie, and ordered a special 3 course dinner for 39 euros.  Each of the courses was well-prepared -  a salad, followed by steak, and then creme burlee, but perhaps not the most exciting preparations.  But the service and atmosphere made for a very enjoyable evening."
4,"Just perfect! I could not decide what to eat so I tried everything -aaahhh! Don't regret on single order. All was delish!! Eggs Florentine, vegan pancake, vegan french toast and vegan chocolate cupcake. Best breakfast for dinner I have had in a long while. Kind of glad I don't live here yet. Will definitely come back.You can sit outside or inside. Service is fast and very friendly. They speak German and English. Have great 80s-90s music running in the background. Really in love with the food. Only thing they are missing is glutenfree options. Hope they will add these. I am in love!! Restaurant is close to public transportation, too. You have to come here if you love breakfasts...even for dinner or any time of the day!"
4,"Love the concept: Choose either the predefined salads, or make your own combination.All the ingredients were so fresh, and it was a huge bowl of salad - I couldn't even finish it.Please note that theres a serious rush hour around lunch, place is probably best avoided at this time. Then again - we came during lunch and still found a place to sit. People dont sit too long, so tables free up all the time.Aaaand - theres free wifi. Bonus when you are tourist!"
4,"Really amazing place. If you arrive early, you can look in the gift shop (lots of chocolate, recipe books, and chocolate related things). The auto museum is also nearby. I took the English tour and it was really great. There are a lot of chocolate tastings along the way (think every time you stop you try something) and our guide was extremely helpful in answering all questions and very interesting (and spoke very good and clear English). Making your own chocolate bar is very fun (and you can sample the add-ons). It's also really interesting to try the chocolate at all steps of its preparation. I would definitely recommend doing this if you're in Hamburg. Be aware that you have to buy tickets for the tour time you want online (no rescheduling). I've left out pictures of the samples themselves because it's more fun to be surprised by them."
4,"WOW!! What a marvellous place...little India.Simple, easy and unconventional but really great. The food is excellent.I had the most basic food...chicken tikka masala. Indian spicy. And it was very spicy! Just perfect.It's a place for great food and less candle light atmosphere.To sum up: Come around and enjoy!"
4,"How is this the first English review of Speicherstadt? Speicherstadt is basically a must-see part of Hamburg. In the past this set of islands was used as a duty-free zone for ships to unload, with customs only coming into force as you crossed one of the many bridges. Nowadays the old warehouses hold a few tourist attractions like the Hamburg Dungeon and the Miniature railway. Randomly they also hold the largest amount of persian rugs outside of Tehran! (Or so I've heard)"
4,"AMAZING! Kittles has done everyone in the Qype community a great service by finding out what the hell this bar is actually called. We don't have the concept of nameless bars in the UK, but in works well here. This place is always busy, in a good way. Sofas that would look hideous in your own living room really fit in well with the downbeat decor, think, faded grandeur with a bit of damp. Great place to meet people as you have to sit next to them. Check it out."
2,Despite its location it is actually a decent bar with pretty good food and cocktails. Opens 24 hours at weekends during summer.
3,"If you are looking for good German fair at a reasonable price, then you can't go far wrong here. Nagel is a traditional German pub, where you can drink and be merry.The food comes quickly and tasty, remember it is traditional so cash is the only way to pay for anything here."
4,Nice and tasty cakes. They also offer vegan ice-creams which are really good! Cappuccino are nice as well. The place in Sternchanze is really cozy and you will feel comfortable and welcomed.
2,"Essen und Wein super - Service fällt dagegen stark ab. Wen's nicht stört ist hier super aufgehoben, um ehrlich italienisch zu essen."
2,"Curry Wurst and Pommes!Generous portions of friesFree Ketchup and/or Mayo = something you won't get at mc do for example! Freshly prepared (to a certain extent) Slow service but at least its a good sign that the food hasn't been sitting there for hours, waiting for a customer."
2,"novel idea. but I wouldn't recommend the experience if you want sushi in all its mastery. it's more for the preis-leistung oriented folks. 25 Euros for 2.5 hours of food binging cmon. that's borderline depravity... ;) better not talk too much now. after all been there, done that. do it if you want to feel like an iPad sorcerer having slightly overworked waiters at your beck and call."
2,"Wow, I am glad I didn't pay 25.50 EUROS for this. Online prices are much cheaper. It's fun and has some local Hamburg history tied in which is cool and cruel. The fear and frightening factor is not as severe as I had expected but it's definitely well advised that kids under 10 aren't allowed (allusions to castration as a means of torture) and those 10-14 only with an adult. I saw the German show and much of its wording seemed to be directly translated from English - just didn't sound that natural in German. The acting was pretty good but I didn't like that you had to go through the entire thing with a rather large group of people. It's tight in some of the rooms and you don't have a chance to see everything because it's so crowded. Although it would be a lot more fun if you were allowed to take pictures or they would at least include the initial photo that they take in the entry price. Didn't feel like paying another 10 Euros for it."
3,A bit over priced I thought but I think that is because of the location. They are right off of the water and across the street from the Westin and the Orchestra House. Outdoor and indoor seating. There are also two parts of this place. One is the brassiere and one was the bistro. I went to the brassiere part. French cuisine and the menu was a little limited. There was steak and pasta basically. I didn't want full meal so I went with the appetizer of Beef Tartar. Nice presentation and it was pretty good. Good for the one visit but not sure if I would be back.
4,"A wonderful authentic German resturaunt. The cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and accomdating staff make for an outstanding experience. Do make a reservation!"
4,"Still the best Italian place in Hamburg, together with other Vapiano's around the city. There are so many copycats lately coming out but this place keeps the standard very well and everytime when we go there it's a special enjoyment. Everything here tastes good, pizza, pasta, salads, bread..."
3,Found this charming place (by smell) on the way to the Warehouse district. I was SO bummed that I wasn't able to snag an English tour.  Why isn't this place on the trip advisor list - it's a total must do!  Who doesn't want a chocolate tour?!!! The shop is FULL of delicious chocolates made in-house and from around the world.  Definitely pick up some decadent chocolates! The ladies at the register are darling.
1,Food is good but not the service- also charges over 2€ for a tiny glass of tap water. Does not take credit cards? What year is this?
3,"Nice cosy little pub. Service was very friendly, beer was cold. An open air market was happening in the square right next to this place. Good selection of dishes, the wurst salad was quite good.Came back for breakfast on Sunday. Three eggs, potatoes and sausage was fabulous, just the thing after a long night in St. Pauli"
3,"Very nice service. Ambiance is good as well. If you are coming in a large group, reserve a table first in advance as they can be easily filled up. We enjoyed the experience & will be coming back again soon."
4,"Stopped by for lunch to realize that the dining room was closed (didn't plan ahead) so we made dinner reservations on the spot. It was mid-week and they were pretty much booked but we snagged a spot for a late-ish dinner.While we waited for our table (we were early), we enjoyed well-prepared cocktails at the bar. Were seated after a very short wait, drinks in hand. Ordered the Entrecôte which comes with corn on the cob, a salad, and your choice of one sauce or butter. I also opted to add a side dish of Kartoffel Röstzwiebel Stampf--a warm, savory, and buttery potato and onion mash which rounded out the meal quite well. Steaks were tender and perfectly cooked, portions were fair, and service was prompt and friendly. Chimichurri sauce was a bit bland but the herb butter was lovely. The house red wine was priced modestly and complemented the steak very well. The table next to us  ordered the ""surprise"" three course meal which consisted of a salad, fish with vegetables, and ice cream dessert. It appeared tasty and they seemed to enjoy it. The space is vast and open with low backed booths and wide and comfy chairs which makes it easy to observe what's going on all around. It's a bit loud, but tables are large enough to give each party enough space. Restaurant is busy, but the bustle isn't intrusive and staff was pleasant across the board. Location is convenient and the restaurant is easy to find. Experience was overall very positive and we're glad we checked it out."
3,"This is your typical dive bar (although now that you can no longer smoke indoors in Hamburg it's much less of a dive). Nice corner place which tends to get quite full later in the evening. It's a fairly typical crowd for Ottensen and isn't as edgy as you may expect from first impressions. I stop in here every now and again as a friend live right down the street. I've never found the staff to be rude and actually realized a couple times that they remembered me, even though I really am not there often. Don't expect an major bartending creations. This is your typical go-for-a-beer place and I also wouldn't trek from other parts of town specifically for the place. At the same time, you can do much worse in the area."
3,"Another fabulous beach bar in Hamburg!Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and lots of tropical kitsch!This has more recliners than most other bars, unfortunately it also fills up quite quickly. The drinks at Del Mar are great, you have fantastic views over the harbour and can just sit back and relax and watch the ships go by. If you've never been to a beach bar or just need to relax after a long day, check out this spot!"
4,"This place is so cute and so cozy! Not to mention the food is fantastic, for vegans and non-vegans alike!The staff is also very friendly and accommodating."
3,"L'osteria is a nice and stylish restaurant opposite of the opera. The pizzas are pretty big and very tasty. The pasta dish was ok. The staff was nice but forgot some drinks and we had to wait pretty long for the drinks. A nice feature was an Italian audio played in the restroom, which taught how to make a restaurant reservation in Italian.The entrance was even with the ground."
4,"if you haven't been there, go there! the miniaturwunderland is a incredible place. suited in beautiful old warehouses of the hamburger speicherstadt two model railway freaks built the worlds biggest model railway. they started 2001 with a model of the hamburg harbour but since then the wonderland has grown continuesly year by year. the alps, norway, switzerland, usa, etc. everything is sculptured beautifully and filled with tons of details (which are the true highlights of the hole thing, because you can find millions of funny and bizarre everyday situations, which often refer to current news/events, i.e. strike of the bundsbahn 2007). and it is not only about railways, the whole thing is a computer controlled super system, which includes day and night changes every five minutes, streets full of traffic, police and fire brigade operations, boats travelling on the seas and in the harbour, etc... amazing! and it is getting bigger and bigger every day..."
4,"We went last night to Bok as I was in the mood for some asian food. I hadn't been here in years and took a look at the ratings. Was a bit worried as the Bok restaurants have been getting ""destroyed"" in the ratings because of service. WELL, they're listening. I was shocked at how nice our waiter was. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy. He asked every time he walked by whether everything was OK and whether we needed anything else. Almost American style (which pisses me off in the US but is nice to see in Germany). The food is great as everyone else writes. The menu is extensive and you'll find everything to fullfill you Asian eating wishes. The places tend to be full on Friday and Saturdays so consider reserving a table. I also can't wait until HH restaurants become all non-smoking. The place was not well ventilated and the people smoking around us kinda killed the experience and flavors of the food. This is soon remedied. In short, the service (at least at this outpost of Bok) took the bad criticism and made an effort to make us happy. Hopefully we didn't just get a good waiter and the rest suck. It will really be disappointing if I go back and service pisses me off. Then I'll never return as everyone else will simply have been right. UPDATE: We were there last night and service was horrible. We received half of our order wrong and the waitress serving us was less than interested in being good at her job. Further, both tables next to us also had mixed up orders. Finally, to top it all off, the folks behind us ordered something which was grilled at their table. Without my knowing it, my back was covered with oil which was splattering all over the place. My shirt was pretty much ruined and luckily I had my leather coat on a chair on the other side of the table. The management didn't care much about offering a solution for this problem except in hindsight saying I should switch seats....note this is after the back of my shirt was splattered with cooking oil. Finally, the food was less than stellar. The sushi was cut super thing (which was not the case the last time we were there). Additonally, I ordered a grilled beef dish which really didn't taste like much. Oh well, I wanted to like Bok but I won't be returning."
3,"I was walking around without my German friend so I had no translator. This place seemed fairly ""Americanized"" so I decided to go in in the hopes that someone here spoke English. I sat at the bar and luckily I was able to speak English to the bartender. He was nice by German standards haha. What I ordered: I got the veggie burger (Tina turner burger) and a beer. The burger was huge! And so tasty! The sauce was mayo-based (I think it was a currywurst sauce, but I'm not sure), but I enjoyed the flavor on this burger. The side was a small salad. Overall, it is not a standout place, but the quality of the food and service was good!"
4,"I've already reviewed the London MASH restaurant so what more can I add here?Well, at the time of writing, this place was only a few weeks old in Hamburg. From my experience, these guys have really hit the ground running.The restaurant located in the smart and swanky harbour area of the city. From the outside and in, it looks and feels distinctly MASH. The glass front gives you views of the harbour but also opens up the restaurant and makes it feel quite spacious. The MASH bods have effectively split the space into two areas either side of the main doors and the cloakroom. The opulent bar is in keeping with the London offering - sleek, modern and stocked with a great range of spirits (especially whiskeys) and cocktails. The restaurant is is spacious and opens out into a second dining area at the back of the restaurant. So how does MASH Hamburg fare versus MASH London? I'd have to say, on this occasion I thought it was potentially better!! The service was faultless. As soon as they realised I was English, out popped the English menu and full service in English. The menu is identical but is actually even better value given that you pay the same in Euros as you do in Sterling. The wine list is also a hugely impressive tome which has to be one of the most comprehensive in Germany. The food was sublime. I ordered my regular; 600g bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed spinach and chips. Having only dined a week previously in London I had a decent barometer but this was even better. That is some compliment. As always, I didn't have space for a dessert. I'll be back in Hamburg and when I am, I will definitely be returning."
3,I think they have great coffee and a good selection of bagels and cakes. Sometimes the bagels don't look that fresh though. The cakes are all very good! You order and pay at the counter and then wait for your order and take it to the table yourself. If they aren't that busy the girls will do that too sometimes. But usually they have a lot to do. They do to-go as well. The Café itself looks a bit rough around the edges. But it's comfy and if you get a window seat it's great to sit and watch the passers by. The back is a bit dark. When it's nice weather you can sit outside too.
4,"Great coffee, great price! The place is cozy and it knows what it's doing. Nothing more to say. Would definitely recommend to drop by!"
3,"I have been here more times then I can remember but recently came to partake in a going away celebration for a co-worker. The food is typical Southern German style and the portions are huge. There is only one thing that is larger than their schnitzel and that is there beer! After all, that is why you go to Hofbräuhaus. It is a huge location with plenty of seats, folk music, and good times. However, if you plan on going you should call ahead and make a reservation. While there you will not only enjoy the beer and food you will be immersed in the Bavarian German culture. Women in their checkered dresses, men in their Lederhosen, and big, burly men chugging pints of beer. You will not be let down!"
4,"This is a coffee roasting venture of tow sweetest Iranian brothers. Everything is self made and passion driven with love for coffee. There is many varieties of coffee you can buy there. All self roasted to perfection and packed in slickly designed ,by one of the talented brothers ,white packages. You can also try tow varieties of coffee there.  Everything around you is very stylishly designed and thoughtfully put together.  What I also love is  that nobody is asking you to sit down when you order your coffee at the counter(always a bad sign that you have to wait for your single shot of expresso for half an hour). Service is fast and quality of coffee is consistent and excellent ."
4,"Great food, large portions, reasonable prices and a quaint old world setting make Thämers the go-to restaurant in this area.What I like the most is the ambiance. It is dark and rustic. Whether with a group of friends or alone with a book, it is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. There isn't a great deal of sitting space inside, so if you are coming at prime time it is a gamble if they will be able to seat you.Favorite dishes here were the pan fish and the pork chop. Both come with a side of fried potatoes, which are very tasty. Potions on all the dishes were hearty.The staff is welcoming, and with a drink the average price is somewhere around €15 for dinner."
3,"Great food and location, amazing view. Nice bar to continue the evening after dinner."
3,"The service was not great...we got there and just stood waiting to be acknowledged for about 15 minutes. They were super busy and finally someone came to take our names down. The seating is uncomfortably close to your neighbor, hardly any personal space. The only good thing was the food."
1,"Well,used to be better. Years ago I was here regularly. But CIU changed for the worse:Drinks: still a big selection. But just not good anymore. Wrong ingredients and somehow too watery.Service: leave me alone...Atmosphere: Too noisy, you just can't talk. Empty by 1am.Conclusion: Won't come again soon. There are better alternatives in Hamburg."
4,"Luhmanns was a pleasant surprise. The tea house was very charming, it had an old world feel. They had a nice selection of teas and cakes. Top notch atmosphere and a very pleasant staff. This was a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
2,"I've had lunch here a few times and to be honest it is not my cup of tea. It is a cool place to have lunch, considering you are eating inside the Rathaus. The food is not horrible but it wasn't memorable in a good way either. I had the Currywurst last time and the sauce was horrible. The texture was like sand, it was bitter, not spicy in least, and plain just tasted bad. The fries were also a bit bland which is surprising since they are fries. I mean how hard is it to screw up fries? The other times I have been here it was for a ""party"". They cleared out the entire place and changed it into a club. They always seemed to have great DJs at those events as well. The price is not the cheapest by any means so bring your money and lots of it."
3,"Whenever i go to that place i do the smart thingI get there before 7 pm , because somehow it gets totally packed as of 7 pm. there's always a waiting line at the door. They have an All you can eat offer for 17EUR. You just sit on the sushi bar and have all those plates parade in front of you, they also have some sweets too (which are not that good FYI). the sushi is of course not the best in the world, but for a 17EUR All you can eat buffet, it's very acceptable. i have already been there a couple of times, and i most certainly will be back!"
4,"Pauli pizza is like an institution in St. Pauli. You get to be creative and do your own pizza.The small basic pizza cost 2EUR50 and the big one 3EUR50.However small is really small, and big is medium size (pizza hut standards) Toppings are between 50c and 1EUR50. Great tasting pizza, that's why it's always busy. So maybe you should pre-order your pizza on the phone then pick it up after 15 minutes, instead of waiting in the really small place, which gets full very quickly!"
4,Perfect place for perfect ice cream. I love that it is clean and modern with outside seating. The ice cream is fantastic and the flavors include transit as well as some newer trendy flavors. Prices are fair and coffee/tea drinks are also available. I will definitely be back!
0,"Came by yesterday around 7pm, really hungry and thirsty, liked the location by the water so we sat on a table outside. One waitress saw us, smiled and went away. We sat for 10 more minutes. Another waitress came and brought the menu. We decided on soup, steak, salad and beer. We waited. After 10 Minutes we had the impudence to wave a waitress who was cleaning the table next to ours, she said ""Kollegin kommt gleich."" Maybe half the tables outside were empty and we saw at least 3 waitresses acting very busy. We waited another 15 minutes, then we left, really hungry and thirsty, to enjoy the ""Beautiful Life"" elsewhere."
1,"I'm giving Wasserschloss two stars because I love the building and location, but the food was not good and the service was really bad. My partner had the vegetarian pasta, which she hated and left unfinished -- there was no sauce on the pasta, so the dish wasn't integrated.  I had the nothing special currywurst, but I'd asked for ketchup and mayo and by the time I finally got it (after asking a couple of times) the pommes frites were cold. And the bill came late after several requests.  Come here for a beer and enjoy what it offers:  ambience."
4,"Couldn't agree more with a lot of the reviews, definitely the best place to get currywurst in Hamburg. It was served in the traditional way, chopped up and with a fresh roll for mopping up all the yummy sauce. Rain or shine you can huddle round a table and awkwardly try and eat this delightful from a paper tray which pigeons swoop in around you. Not a gourmet dining experience but a must do in my opinion."
3,"Very cute Scandinavian coffee shop, restaurant and novelty store :) When you first enter, it is decorated with of course the sweet wooden red horses that I own at home which I bought in Stockholm.  The colors are also very Scandinavian to me, with pastels, lights and brights. To the right is a boutique that sells Scandy candies, treats and miscellaneous gifts or decorations.  Once can stop in for a Fika which means coffee in Swedish or even have a nice meal.  They usually have Köttbullar, but since most dishes are made fresh in the back in a limited quantity, you have to check with the waitress to see what is on the menu that day. When I came in here, I ended up ordering some Tagliatelle with mushrooms and a truffle sauce which was very filling! I had wanted to of course try a more Swedish dish or even the classic Köttbullar (Swedish Meatballs) but to my dismay, they were fresh out of meatballs that day.Hamburg is actually heavily influenced by Scandinavian culture being so far north and in their history, the Danes and Swedes settled in areas around here such as Altona for example, particularly because the Hanseatic League had some battles over shipping merchant ships and even a history with Pirates.....and Vikings! I had to learn about this history when I did an Elbe/Altona tour :)Come here for breakfast, lunch or dinner they have cute names for their breakfast menu with Scandinavian themes like: the Oslo, the Stockholm, the Kopenhagen, and even you can order the Aarus. They also have wifi here!"
0,"My partner and I thought the place was lovely - very minimalistic and tasteful. I loved the gorgeous wooden tables and floor. The service was awful though. I guess I'm the first to say it about Erste Liebe: but the waitress we had was really rude. I've never had the inclination to write and complain after receiving bad service but the waitress we had was incredibly unpleasant. She was rude from the minute she came to us. At the end of our visit, she snatched the money off of my partner's hands and stomped off without a word. It ruined the place for us, really. Unfortunate - because we enjoyed everything else about this place."
4,"Located on the ""high street"" of Barmbek on the Fuhlsbüttler strasse small thai/chinese restaurant. In my opinion they make the best peking soup ever! Cheap but very good quality! Highly recommended!"
4,One of the best doner durums I've eaten. And 3.5 Euro is a good price.
1,I went into the meatery last night after have a few cocktails on the roof top of the hotel. I didn't feel like having steak so I opted for a burger. I got the classic burger which was a disappointment.  The burger was cold and not cooked to my liking. I got the brioche bun which was flat and not what I am used to a brioche bun being like.  The fries were good and piping hot . Overall I was disappointed I would never order there burger again.
0,"The W O R S T fish I've had in Hamburg so far!I'll keep it simple stupid:1. The place reeks. 2. The quality of the fish is horrendous as it is frozen and flavourless. 3. Even the sides are not fresh and every bit of nutrition cooked out of them. They only got one star because the staff was friendly. However, I don't go to restaurants because the staff is friendly."
2,"Got much better since they cleared the view of the ships.Really, the main reason to be here is that next-door classic Strandperle is too crowded, again.Food is a little bit cheaper, but also less good. But that's not why you are down here.It's the view, the beer, the sun, the beach.Feels a tiny bit less professional than Strandperle, and that's a good thing too."
3,"Had steak menus here, twice, yummy! Nice service and a great atmosphere!"
2,"This HB location in Hamburg is not as good as the Haufbrauhaus in Munich, Berlin or Las Vegas. The food is all the same great quality however the atmosphere is not as festive as the others. We came in on a Thursday evening at about 6:45pm. We were met at the front door by two muscle bound ape security guards that seemed to intimidate customers by their presence. We, however were seated right away even though we did not have reservations. The service was good and prompt, however there was no live Bavarian music after 7pm like the others, just the football game on tv. The food and beer was good as expected, but not much fun after that."
4,"Finally some fresh, delicious and with love prepared food! We loved the place! Definitely a must for foodies!"
2,"Update: Last time I was here the service was rude and so slow that we had to threaten to leave before we finally got given our tapas. My old score was 5/5. ================== This place is excellent. Best tapas I've had in Hamburg, and I've previously had some pretty good tapas. More food than we could eat + beers for five guys and the bill only came to EUR47(!) Things to definitely order:-the spicy potatoes (10 or 12 on the menu, I forget)-the chorizo (it comes flaming!)-the honey-mustard chicken-the fried cheese & ham thingys (I will learn the name) I'll definitely be back."
4,"People had been telling me that this place does the best Turkish food in Hamburg for years  basically ever since I lived in Hamburg. Last Friday I finally remembered to check it out, and boy was I glad that I did! Two of us arrived at about 8pm on a Friday. There were already about 10 people waiting for tables, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The service was pleasant and quick, but it's worth noting that they do not serve any alcohol here. What they do serve is meat! Basically everything on the menu and everything that I saw being delivered to tables looked amazing. The kebab plate that I ordered (I forget the name, sadly) was huge and very tasty, but my companion's lamb kebab was even better. I will be back to try more of the menu, and I'll be bringing more friends!"
4,When in Hamburg- must try this Italian gem ;) the creamy pasta with truffles is the most delicious dish I've had! You can share small dinner portion with the veal fillet ... OUT OF THIS WORLD. The waiters are all very nice and helpful- Bon App!
3,"This is a new breakfast favorite. Have been coming here for some time and never wrote a review. We like sitting outside on the upstairs balcony. Great people watching as well as a great breakfast. When it's too cold we prefer sitting at the bar upstairs and eating there. The service is super nice and breakfast is pretty varied and always tasty. One argument I have is that the place tends to be a bit smoke filled if too many smokers are around. Somehow the place doesn't air out well and if there are a bunch of smoker around, we turn around and head elsewhere. Otherwise, a great place that's very central and comfortable. Great place to hit for breakfast followed by shopping in town. If you come, make sure to sit upstairs....downstairs is kinda boring and if it's nice outside, you can sit out front or upstairs on the balcony. Don't forget though that the balcony fills up real quick. They also have heating towers outside and blankets so even on colder days, the outdoor option is one to consider."
4,another treasure in the industrial West side on the way to the football stadium. great north German fare. try the rotbarsch filet. the bratkartoffeln is a bit too oily for my taste. also the fish soup! lots of chunky fish pieces and shrimps. wholesome food for the soul. lecker!
4,"Love the ambience, nice n clean for local fine dining! Great food n wonderful service!"
0,"The food might be ok, but the waitress / unbelievable unfriendly and rude. We had to go to the front to get the menu and clear our own table. Horrible!"
4,"Amazing Breton style buckwheat crepes. I had the Nordique, which comes with smoked salmon and sour cream. The atmosphere was pleasant and nautical and my table shared a bottle of the house white wine which went perfectly with the meal. Ask for an English menu, there is one available."
4,"The best spätzle in town, the place is really cozy and the people very friendly. If you are looking for german food, this is the best place to have a wonderful experience."
2,"Can't claim to be from SoCal, but I know a good Burrito when I taste one and this steak burrito almost ticked the boxes. I was looking for taste and chilli zing and I got everything I was looking for. Would have liked to have seen some authentic sauces to add to the heat, but they use that Chinese Sriracha stuff, you know with the yellow stopper. No matter, it did the job well. Later discovered some Lol Tun Habanero sauce which I applied liberally.Thrash Metal on the stereo which didn't make for a restful experience, but hey, the Schanze is not made for rest even at 1pm! But the other mainly younger crowd seemed to be grooving to it! The guys who run this place are obviously big metal fans, one wall is covered with pics of men in gimp masks. Either that, or along with the hard seating, it's an effective device to keep the customers moving and discourage lingerers.If I was to be critical, I would highlight their steak cooking process, which seemed not be via a grill, more like  steamed steak! Were I to return, I'd choose another filling and perhaps take some earplugs along.Sorry but it has to be three stars."
2,"This review is for the Tattoo Exhibit only. Went to the museum today excited to see what would be portrayed about Tattoo history etc. Basically, it was a lot of photographs of modern day tattoo wearers talking about their tattoos. A few old machines in a display box, a ton of tattoo books on a table, and displayed pigments.  The exhibit seemed super touristy in a sense that it was very basic, and maybe curated by someone fascinated by the culture, and not actually a part of it.I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the historic Skin Samples on display. That saved the exhibit. Everything else you can see in the same fashion on the internet. Pictures of pictures etc."
4,"Beside its small room, the coffee here is good, the staff is nice and there is wifi. I can comfortably seat on a sofa with my computer, take the WiFi (probably not from there but it works nicely), and spend hours. Their cappuccinos are big!"
4,"Hard to believe, but Altona and Hamburg were two rivals. Now Altona is part of Hamburg (a nice, charismatic part), but I guess there still was a need to have its own museum. And I must say, well done guys! Small, but very informative museum, revolving around Elbe and everything which comes with it: shipbuilding, whaling(thank God it's in the past), fishery, sea trade, port and so on. A message is clear: the river is a key to regions past and the future. There's a beautiful collection of figureheads occupying the whole room. Also a hall dedicated to Schleswig-Holstein, Helgoland island in particular. This museum is very similar to  surprise Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (Hamburg Museum), but smaller. It has a few things, which its bigger brother doesn't have: the whole interactive section dedicated to kids - Kinderolymp and a restaurant, Vierländer Kater, a house in the house, replicating typical Northen German tavern of 18th century. The restaurant itself worth visiting, great concept!"
4,"Hands down the best falafel in Hamburg. Freshly made, unlike par for the course at most Döner places, who just microwave something that resembles warm wet cardboard. Not only are the falafel fresh, but also perfectly made, crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. All the vegetarian salads and sides like tabbouleh and hummus are also good. If you dine-in- try either the Falafel or Mixed plate (5 Euros), served with a plate full of side dishes. If youre on the run, get the falafel in bread (2.50, ""spezial"" for 3 Euros with your choice of extra like eggplant)."
3,"This is a newly opened Indian restaurant in the Hallerstrasse. It's nicely decorated and the staff is very attentive. They also have a large selection of vegetarian dishes at good prices. My Tarka Dal was delicious and at a reasonable price. Only the service was not particularly fast, so make sure you have some time when you visit."
2,"Of all the cities in Germany I've been to, the Hamburg Rathaus was probably the most structurally appealing that I've seen.Really just like any other city center though... lots of shops, stores, restaurants, busy area of town."
1,"Had a quick diner here with some colleagues during a work visit to Hamburg. It was on a Saturday and very early (before 19:00) so not at all busy though several table had already been reserved. I had the veal Wiener schnitzel. As schnitzels go a Wiener Veal is my absolute favourite. I didn't like the one the served me that evening. It was way to thin and very dry. For all I know it could have been last night's left over, that's how bad it tasted. Also didn't like the fact that they charge extra for the Preiselbeeren. If ever I would visit this place again I would not have the Wiener Veal Schnitzel again!"
4,Very good food and incredibly nice staff. The restaurant has a cosy atmosphere. Mango lassi was also tasty.
4,"Astra Stube is one cool little bar! It's basically a tiny little gig venue located under the S-Bahn tracks in the north-west of the schanze. It's a bit out of the way, but if you're into your local independent rock and indie music, then you'll definitely want to put this on you list of must-visit places. The only real drawback is that the place is just too small, so it gets very sweaty very fast. Oh well, you can't have everything :)Since writing the above review two years ago a few things have happened. 1) The bar was going to be closed (along with many nearby businesses) due to work on the above railway bridge2) There was a large outcry; notably the Jan Delay album ""Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Soul"" features a photo of the bar as it's front cover; The work was put back a few years3) The popular Hamburg-based film ""Soul Kitchen"" featured a scene in the bar, somehow managing to make the bar look something other than tiny."
2,"This tourist spot has its ""cool factor"" being one of the biggest miniature displays of its kind in the world, but the crowded Disneyland long lines of pushing and shoving while walking around inside of this destination, steals away from the magic of the Wonderland, because you wonder if you will ever get to see something up close, because there are so many cute kids running around pointing and cheering in awe.  You feel kinda like a jerk if you do not offer your spot to one of these sweet faced angels to get a closer peek before you.  If and when it is not overly crowded, which is hardly the case as this is a very popular tourist spot for not just kids but also adults, the displays are really fascinating. They have an airplane runway where you actually see model planes from most international carriers, I mean, I am Thai and I even saw a Thai Airways plane!  You get to watch them slowly pull out onto the runway like a real plane then take off into the sky complete with sounds of the engines!Most of the displays are European and being an American, it is cool to see, but hard to identify with the land markings as much as a European child or adult would recognize the details better.  They have the Alps, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavian countries, and even the USA, particularly the Vegas display interested me.  There is a mixture of switching from day to night scenes in the rooms, and also an entire water display  going into the Northern Scandinavian countries. My favorite miniature area was Hamburg, because I live here and it was cool to recognize the layout of the city, see the Hafencity, the churches, the super cool HSV football stadium complete with HSV fans in the seats,  etc..... Miniature displays are also more identifiable with people if they personally know the thing or place well that is being miniaturized because we all like to check for accuracy and are amazed at the details and intricate work that goes into these ornate displays.Tip: Try to either go really early in the day when it opens or really later in the day before it is about to close, otherwise, it is often too crowded to see anything and you feel rushed to look at move on so you are not blocking the way for others to see."
4,"After reading about this place in the New York Times' 36 Hours in Hamburg, I went to Hamburg just to see this place and I was not disappointed.We spent 3 hours(2.5 hours looking and 30 minutes in the cafeteria where they have several types of beer and free wifi)  there and still felt that we had missed things. The scope was amazing as was the detail.The only reservation that they had online was at 6:30 pm on the day we wanted to go (which was a holiday weekend in Germany). This was a great time to go as there were no lines and very few people.We ate in the cafeteria at 8:30 pm (they stop serving food at 9 pm) but they were still replenishing the food and it was pretty good (3 Radlers and 2 wurst and frites dinners for 17 Euros).They have a coat and baggage check. They also have charging lockers for digital camera batteries. You need a 1 Euro coin to start the charging, but you get it back when you retrieve your charged battery. They know that people take a lot of pictures here and they run down their batteries."
3,"Restaurant Engel is always a nice place to stay! With a beautiful view on the river Elbe, you can watch the container ships passing by while having a nice dinner."
4,"Whenever in Germany, I always make an effort to visit the Hofbräu house.I've been to the other location here in Hamburg, but this location on Esplanade has a more authentic vibe based on the original Hofbräu Haus in Munich.Came here this time with a large group from work (in Germany for an Expo), and everyone was pleased and enjoyed the evening.Most of us ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which is my favorite.You simply must make an effort to dine here."
3,So a place called Mr. Kebab is not exactly what you would think of as great for a pesqutarian. This though was one of my favorite meals in Hamburg. There were a whole bunch of vegetarian options and the one I got was absolutely delicious. My mouth waters thinking of this restaurant. Great place to visit!
4,"I don't really do reviews, this is more of a personal bookmark, so to meet the minimum word count I'll just say it is definitely a chinese restaurant, located in Hamburg."
4,"Fantastisch und wirklich kaiserlich. Sehr geschmackvoll und mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet. Die Speisen sind authentisch schmackhaft und die Besitzerin (eine echte Österreicherin) sowie die zauberhaften Mitarbeiter/innen im Service sind bemerkenswert aufmerksam und sehr kompetent. Dieses Kleinod mit herrlicher Sonnenterrasse in der Hafencity habe ich für mich entdeckt und empfehle es allen, die den Standard satt haben und das Besondere unserer Tage suchen."
3,"Popped in here the other day when my staple in the area was unexpectedly closed. The Roosen is a cute lil' place - the sofas are well comfortable, service is very friendly (albeit a tad hover-ey), drinks are well prepared and the price is right (4.50 for a caipirinha sounds like my cup of caipirinha!). Would love to come back here - a really nice place to kick back early and drink yourself through the evening on a weeknight with some good company. One star off for the kind of toilets you don't want to visit when you're a tad tipsy - the trip down will send you into a spin!"
2,"This coffee shop has been hyped as one of the best places in Hamburg for a coffee. For me personally, to test the coffee quality in an outlet specializing in coffee the gold standard is to order an Espresso. What shall I say? Their Espresso is a far cry from a decent Espresso... it looks like a bland blackish puddle produced by a fully automated machine and tastes also like it. No crema, very watery. The only plus is a very fruity and light taste to the coffee, reminding me of a spring flower bouquet. So, coffee quality fairly ok, preparation a no-go. Service is definitely not this spot's strength with both counter attendants minding their own business with an air of utter indifference toward the customer. Maybe this experience is a one-off and I would see a very different atmosphere some other time around. Yet, there won't be another time."
1,"Meh. Food was ok at best. Find it weird they roll their burritos all in the morning, my friend tried to order one without chili sauce and because of said rolling, this wasn't possible. Overhyped. They try to give off this whole ""oh you didn't reserve vibe, well we are too good for you."" Kinda vibe. Blah I'll deal with said nuances of food is amazing, but again, is nothing to go nuts about."
3,"Huge dishes - we went for traditional lamb & duck, the steak tartare looked a bit overwhelming (neighbouring table ordered it).  Very cool basement setting with high arched ceilings between old columns"
3,"On a spur, we checked out this restaurant near the Altona Sbahn. I'm a vegetarian and was super pleased with the options. The food was quite tasty and the service was good too. I enjoyed it!"
1,"Tiefenthal is a cafe/bar/restaurant. Unlike the places at Schanze, this one is really ""higher"" class. It's crowded and unfortunately pretty expensive (but hey, you are in Hamburg - so it's not like you are already not used to it). We didn't go for food, just drinks and the cocktails were pretty good. The Tiefenthal is one of those places you can take your parents for a drink, or yuppie-kinda people (no offense). But if there would be alternatives in Eppendorf, I'd rather go there. As far as I can tell, there are none though."
4,"This restaurant is a true gem! It's been in business and family run since the 1970s, so expect some brilliant traditional Italian cooking. I try to go every time I'm in Hamburg."
0,There really are NO DISGUSTING words that I could possibly muster to perfectly describe what a horrible place this was! From the get go the waiter was such crabby old man- I asked for hoisin sauce he looked at me like I was asking for marinara sauce! Later to give it time I asked for some ice to cool the €9 euro bottle of water that was room temperature & he literally rolled his eyes at me- Seriously? Ok whatever- just bring the dim sum out and be done with it- a few plates of mediocre fare later he brings out what should have been the highlight- Sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf- we carefully unwrapped the steamy hot item only to find what looked like a massive dung with no discernible rice grains to speak of- just a big brown turd of mush- still I dissected it as supposedly it contained chicken- which at the very center was a dried up tasteless chicken wing- bone in and just GROSS! I called the crabby old man over and lied that while we enjoyed the other items that this was just inedible- thank you please retire it from the table- which he did- I felt bad for having returned something so I asked for another small plate of dim sum to make up for it- but when the bill came to my surprise he had charged me for the lotus wrapped pile of ... and so I said to him- I'm sorry but you forgot to remove this from my bill- and he insisted that he would not take it off my bill that I HAD TO PAY!  I was indignant at how utterly preposterous this was- I have rarely returned anything and when I have the service has been apologetic and settled quickly- the crab would not let up and the scene he was making in the restaurant had me on pins and needles- there's a price for dignity and it was obvious his was €6 euros! NEVER EAT HERE if you're in Hamburg! Try the Dim Sum Haus literally around the corner! Bon Appetit! Just NOT at the Mei Moon-
3,"The food was good, we ordered the schanke and the steak. Both was really good. We ordered the apfelstrudeln as dessert and this we can recommend. The reason for the 4 star is that we had to wait for 45min for the main dishes. That was a long wait for the relatively simple dishes. This is of course disputable, but that's how we felt. The strudeln came after 15min too. The check? Guess what, it came in with a minute."
3,"The place is small and luckily we had a reservation, because it was very full (friday evening). In the end they even sent people away because there was no more food. However, the burgers were big and delicious. I had a vegan Burger with sweetpotatoe fries, both very good. We didn't have to wait long for the food and even though there was a lot going on, the waitress was really kind and not stressed. We felt very comfortable. Last but not least, prices are absolute appropriate!"
3,"Good Italian food for my birthday! Italian restaurant with candlelight ambience. Had awesome tomato and pesto bruschetta. My husband had Italian meat bruschetta and he just loved it. That was our starter. The main courses that we ordered were half vegetariana pizza and half salami pizza plus asparagus cheesy risotto. They were so good. The staff was friendly as well. Overall, had a good tasty dinner!"
3,"Keep coming back for the fried noodles and of course Vietnamese Ice Coffee! The restaurant can be very packed during lunch time or dinner time. I don't know if what they serve is authentic, but I'm pretty sure it's tasty!"
4,Best Ethiopian restaurant in Hamburg hands down. I am Ethiopian and I haven't had quality Ethiopian food in Germany. My girlfriend also liked it. The place is small and intimate. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to have a good Ethiopian food in Hamburg. P.S. you'd need to get a reservation in advance.
2,"Been here a bunch of times at this point. I always get the Döner Teller to go but most of my colleagues get the regular Durum Döner. One way or another, the fresh bread in this place is super tasty. The meat is also usually quite good. Unfortunately, the service here is extremely hectic and not at all customer friendly. Actually super annoying is the process of ordering. You pay, get a ticket and wait. No one really makes much of an effort to find out what you want and if full at lunch, it's chaotic. Further, the place is a dive. Each of the many guys behind the counter is covered in grease stains and sweat. Hand washing seems to be a non-issue and I am concerned about these guys touching my food. Finally, the restaurant itself is filthy. It's not inviting from the outside and the interior is quite repulsive. In summary, the food is actually tasty and the bread is the best part. Unfortunately, you have to risk food poisoning when eating here. I do admit at times I say f""§k it and just go for broke. You only live once! :-)"
4,"The chocolate tour was very interesting. Learned a lot about chocolate, where it comes from and how it's made.  Enjoy tastes from every step of the process and make your own chocolate bar. Super fun time ad great quality chocolate!"
4,"A cozy, tasteful room tucked into a pretty corner of Hamburg. We went for the 9-course ""classic"" menu with wine pairings. A truly wonderful journey through food and wine, punctuated with a main course of Ibérico pork, unbelievably tender and layered with flavors. On each plate, the juxtaposition of varied elements allows multiple facets o taste - every dish having a multitude of flavor complementary profiles. A world-class experience."
3,"The name Mr. Kabob gave me with the expectation of a quick fast food counter. While the food is quick, it's actually a comfy and cozy cafe with take away or table service/eat in options. Large windows let in sunlight and pillows line the bench. They also have several small tables outside along the cafe. The other surprise was the size of the Donner kabob I ordered. They have bread and rolled options, I went with the bread and it was huge. The bread was soft, slightly toasted and warm. The chicken inside was really good as was the sauce, my only real complaint was wanting more sauce, more evenly distributed. They also use a cabbage mix for the veggies, while my personnel presence is just lettuce along with the tomato and cucumber.Good price, good food, friendly staff."
4,Super cute and fantastic coffee. The bagel sandwiches were delicious and the staff is so friendly. I love this place.
4,"This place is an oasis of human interaction and peace. I really loved it! It was one of the most or I could say most heartwarming experiences visiting a place can offer. You get to know not only how it is - to see nothing and spend time in dark - but whats more important is that you learn to trust the person guiding you, not even seeing them. Just buy touch. When it ended I wished that peace and trust could last longer. Have to apply well in advance to get a tour, but it is so worth it. Also don't forget to put a few Euros in pocket(have to leave stuff in locker) to get to buy some drink, I had chocolate milk, and it tasted amazing! Great experience, would go again!"
1,"Great atmosphere, and they're very accommodating.   I ordered Nackensteak, and it was terrible, all tough and mostly gristle.  Not much to eat out of eat, but it was my first time eating Nackensteak, so maybe it's supposed to be like that.  I went with a large group and they were able to accommodate us all sitting together.  The salad I had was good."
3,"Relatively pricey, but excellent food - we had steak tartare (mediterranean + oriental style), ribeye on the bone and new york cut, topped off with a lemongrass sorbet with vodka. All awesome, though steak was not the best I've ever had (reserved, for now, for the Hix Oyster and Chop House in London!). Only downside was a degree of pretentiousness and mild obnoxiousness of other clientele - not really the restaurant/bar's problem (apart from the high volume of the mediocre techno dj) - all of the waiting/bar staff were excellent and appropriately attentive."
4,Was very impressed with this stylish and cool restaurant which used to be an old warehouse. It is very different to any restaurant I've been to. The food was also very tasty and the staff were very pleasant.
4,"Food is great, taste good, but not authentic. The service puts it over the top, you can't find good service like this anywhere outside of the US. The service here is even better than the US Vietnamese restaurants."
3,"went with a Groupon Gutschein, great food and live pan on the table!!"
4,Great experience and great food. Would recommend. Get the tasting menu! Reasonable compared to other places. Not pretentious.
2,"I stumbled in here on the end of a girls night out already one too many vino's... there was an entrance fee but we just pushed through anyways so I actually am unsure how much it was?! It was an 80""s night with all your favorite ""love-to-hate-but-secretly-i'm-a-80's-fan-too"" tracks ! People were in costume which added to the trashyness of it and there were plenty of lounges to park myself down on and take it all in. Fun!!"
4,"Absolutely amazing. If you are in Hamburg for a few days, I would say this is a nice little visit. Theres a lot of detail to see and easily miss. I felt like one hour was good there but if you are in to this sort of thing, you could definitely stay longer. There were multiple levels and lots of interaction. I think its great for families."
4,"This is exactly what a neighbourhood Italian restaurant should be. On a quiet street you enter down short steps into a small bustling eating area. We turned up unannounced lateish on a Tuesday evening. The Trattoria was full but we were all made welcome with glasses of prosecco while we waited. And it was worth the wait. Deciding to go with tradition, I had the Ossobucco, which was just as rich and flavoursome as I had hoped. Other traditional dishes taken included Linguine Vongole etc - all apparently also fully enjoyed. Highly recommended for small groups, friends and romantic meals."
2,"The German language reviews of Noah's by some of Hamburg's expert Qypers are extremely positive about this small Greek restaurant, but though i found it perfectly acceptable, it was nothing special. On the upside the service was friendly (we were the only people there) and the beer cold and large! There was also decent dip with warm bread to start, but the (chicken) souvlaki seemed dry and without enough grilled vegetables to assist it. And given the emptiness of the place, there was none of the atmosphere one hopes for from Greek restaurants. The lunchtime set menu looks good value and maybe it fills up then."
4,"Original koreanisches essen, wirklich sehr gut! Auch das sushi ist zu empfehlen. Also nicht von der betagten Einrichtung abschrecken lassen, das essen ist klasse."
4,"Nice café just near the Elbphilharmonie. It looks like an old parisian bookstore with its wooden furniture. Really cool style. The other rooms are more commun, I would recommend (if possible) to go to the one which has its door just in front of the Elbphilharmonie."
4,"Incredible food, great wine selection, service was excellent, and ooo the deserts were to die for. A must try while in Hamburg."
3,"Super location across from Abaton Kino in the University quarter of Hamburg, this Turkish restaurant is a favorite of students and movie enthusiasts. I have enjoyed lunches and dinners here for close to ten years and throughout that time quality and service have varied but during the FilmFest Hamburg, both were exceptional. A big bonus is the non-smoking section in the front of the restaurant, actually away from all the smokers. My spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo dough served with a green salad was hot, fresh and mouthwateringly delicious. Not only that, but when I flashed my press pass and said I was in a hurry, I had the best fast food ever. Many appetizers are enough for a good value meal, but as with most places, prices have gone up so it is not the bargain it used to be, particularly when it comes to drinks. The atmosphere depends on the customers as the place itself is unremarkable and at garden level (meaning limited daylight) but outside tables on a sunny day can be quite the treat. Open seven days a week from 9:00am until 3:00am with breakfast and special lunch menu."
3,I am not normally a fan of places like this but I have to say that my fist visit to Sausalitos was more than pleasant! It seems to be a great after work place that has become adept at making sure groups of friends can enjoy an after work cocktail (half price until 8pm) and some tasty mexican food. The atmosphere is buzzy and the music cranks up a bit later in the evening (maybe that was the strange looking blue cocktail I had?) The service is swift and friendly an nothing seemed to be too much trouble. I will be going back soon to try the extra stron Chilli!
4,"The light show is really beautiful. I wasn't going to go, but changed my mind at the last minute. I quickly taxied over from my hotel and got out and ran to the park. I was able to make it there by 10:15 (it starts at 10:00) and the show lasted until 10:30. I sat on the side of the lake opposite the large tower on a cement block. It put me the closest to the fountains of anyone, but this also meant I got pretty wet. If you don't mind getting wet, I would also recommend going for that seat."
4,"Alright I'm gonna be honest here: I got into this place purely by accident. I was particularly hungry, tired, and I couldn't be bothered walking any further. I saw the light, I saw the Italian sign and I just decided 'right, that will do!"":)I was seated within less than 10mn by another lonely chap at the nearby table and greeted cheerfully by the staff. It felt really cosy and the place has a really homy atmosphere, with a mix of locals, business customers as well as a few tourists like me.I was provided with the menu but as I probably know 2 words of German, the waiter nicely gave me an overview of what was on offer and made some suggestions. A glass of red wine, truffle Carpaccio and a perfectly cooked filet later, I was full and content :). The food was lovely and the thing that then came to mind at that stage was that it was probably going to cost me an armbut gosh, this was ex-cel-lent italian food!44EUR later:)  No regret here though. This was a lovely Italian restaurant with well cooked and selected food, excellent customer service and I'll certainly recommend it in the future. I really don't have a problem spending money when the whole experience is top notch from start to finish. Plus, let's be honest, I already know the hotel menu off by heart now so a bit of adventure was needed anyway!"
3,"I tried the palak paneer combo that was available at lunch. Overall, I was satisfied with the meal and had a nice siesta. The combo comes with yoghurt, black lentils, spinach paneer, zeera rice, salad and naan. What I did not like was that the portions for yoghurt and lentils were pathetic. So I find it funny that the black lentils was either too bland or too small a portion to even get a proper taste. Restaurant itself is, obviously, too small and may not appear too hygienic to certain folks. Based on my conversations with the locals including Indians, the place offers authentic Indian food and sweets are also a specialty here."
4,"If you want to drink a glass of wine with a wonderful panoramic view, don't hesitate to go up to this bar restaurant. You will have access to the rooftop where you can chill on the comfortable benches or armchairs. The waiters are kind and they know their products so they can advise you for your order. The only thing is that it's a bit expensive but you will forget the price once you taste their tasty wines."
1,"This is a low-quality Indian shop in the food court of the Europa Passage. None of the entrees that I've tried taste more than just okay. It's priced accordingly to actual Indian places in Hamburg, and as the food isn't very tasty, you should avoid going here unless you're specifically in the Europa passage and don't want to walk anywhere else to get food. It's fine for Europa Passage terms. I usually eat here or the falafel place when I'm lazy and in the mall."
3,Cute restaurant with a great ambiance. Feels like it is lit by candles making it warm and welcoming. Get the potato pancakes!
3,"Delicious food, quick service. Nice selection of soups and salads. Great lunch spot, although you might find it hard to get a seat, takeaway is fine with a nice spot by the river to eat nearby.Always busy, with queues out the door."
3,It's all decorated with Mexican wrestling accouterments and the burritos may not be California (or Texas?) worthy but they're better than anything you'll find in New York City.
0,"been to this place too many times (10 times at least). Everything is perfect until tonight when I paid for a drink at the bar and then didn't get anything after 5 mins. I asked the waitress that I paid for my drink but she pretended that I didn't pay her! She is a blondish girl (not a real blond) in the corner of the bar when you get in. SHE IS A LIAR! be careful of bartenders there! I mean this girl is cheaper than a prostitue she claimed I didn't pay her for a beer that costed 3.5€, come on even a prostitute is worth more! poor girl ..."
3,"I had seen this place a couple times when at cafes or restaurants nearby but always passed as it was so full. This is obviously a good sign. We weren't disappointed. Came for breakfast on a Sunday and sat outside. Service is great and very attentive. The younger girl was super nice and the lady who was in the kitchen (and came out here and then to bring dishes) was also very pleasant. The food was great. We had a mix of breakfast options plus a piece of cheesecake at the tail end plus coffee and fresh mint teas. Everything was prepared with care and tasted really good. What I didn't like is that basically everything was reserved, even at an early hour and basically, a lot of tables sat empty for quite a while unused. Later on though, it was packed and I had noticed that some people would of have liked to take a seat but didn't as all tables were supposedly taken. One can't avoid this with such a small space but it could be managed a bit better in my opinion. Otherwise, we'll definitely be back (with a reservation) and will do our best to enjoy their front terrace area as when the weather is nice, this is the best option."
4,"Love this place!!! Amazing Turkish coffee and fantastic selection of Turkish sweets , baked goods and puddings. Yum!!"
1,"I'm sure this is a nice place to grab a coffee or sandwich - at least it looks nice - but for me, it was one great disappointment.- The people working pretented to not understand a single word of my English and if they did, they answered in German. They also didn't look at me when talking to me and I basically didn't feel welcome at all.- The breakfast plate I had been so extremely looking forward to ever since I saw the photos both here on Yelp and on Instagram wasn't mentioned on the menu, and when I asked for it I was told that that's only for special occassions or special people (!).+ The caffè latte and little yoghurt bowl with granola I ended up with tasted very good.So Hej papa deserves more than one star because of the food, the location and the cute name ;), but I would never ever go there again. Although, if they'd offer me that breakfast plate.........."
2,"The 20 UP is located in a Hotel in the St Pauli district. It is of course known for its breathtaking views of the city. However that is about it. The service is horrible, the drinks are watered down, and it is rather small. And because it has become even more popular with tourist so it is filled to the brim with them.In my opinion, go there once, keep your coat on, walk over to the window, take a few pictures and enjoy the view and then get the hell out of there. You'll thank me later."
3,"Awesome old-school hip-hop! I came here last night (a Monday). Though it was a bit empty, the Dj was awesome and the drinks, tasty.  Their drink menu is, impressively, extensive. Was not a fan of the cigarette smoke, but it Is Germany, so I guess it comes w/ the territory.  Very friendly bartender and ladies bathroom! If you want a chill, relaxed environment w/ great 90s music, this is your place!"
3,"I was surprised to see a concept like green lovers here in Hamburg. It reminded me of Mixt Greens in San Francisco.The menu includes suggested salads, a make-your-own salad option, soups, and panini. All of the salads are made fresh when you order. I went with the falafel veggie salad special they had advertised on the counter with the green lovers dressing (herbs, lemon, olive oil). It had a great balance of ingredients and a nice hummus on top. Definitely a fan.Service was also surprisingly friendly despite the lunch rush. Again, other than that whole ordering in German part, I felt like I had just walked through a portal to Mixt Greens in downtown SF.The only downside is that the space is a little tight and is pretty much packed by 12:30pm. If you'd like a place to sit and don't mind getting bumped into every so often, I'd aim for right before noon and stick to parties of 2. The line always moves fast and they offer takeout, so that could be a good plan B if you happen to arrive after half of Hamburg's workforce has."
4,"Fantastic cafe in St. Pauli for sunny days. There's a little ledge outside you can enjoy your coffee on, and it catches the morning sun perfectly. Delicious bread, eggs, meat, cheese and salad. And nice people. Recommend."
4,"A great new Irish pub in Deichstrasse. A great selection of beer and whiskey as the name would suggest. Live music, karaoke and live sports on tv add to the atmosphere. Definitely a great place to meet up and only a short walk from Rodingsmarkt U-Bahn station. Richard and the team give you a warm welcome and I look forward to going back many times."
3,Cool and stylish with prices to match. Always a relaxed atmosphere - a decent place to catch up with friends.
4,Wir waren erneut zum Frühstück unter der Woche dort. Sehr hochwertige Speisen auf wirklich schön angerichteten Tellern  und ausreichend war es auch. Wir kommen wieder.
4,"Nice informal atmosphere, simple but cracking menu, country potatoes are the absolute best in Hamburg."
1,"It looks stylish inside but there are far better Italian places to eat - service was friendly however and it sounds like the pizza might be ""ok"".  The brown butter sage on cheese ravioli was sad, to say the least.  The ravioli tasted like average, pre cooked heated up ravioli.  The sauce was NOT brown butter sauce how it should be.  I was not worth €9,00.  I make this simple butter sauce at home and it's easy to make correctly.  What was served was not proper Browned butter but rather some kind of premade melted butter (probably with the typical shot of German sahne in the mix).  There were only 3 little sage leaves on the pasta making the flavor distribution a disappointment.  Wouldn't waste my money here... Especially in a city/country where eating out is not cheap."
4,"This is the best place Hamburg has to offer.Come here as long as it's not raining too much; enjoy the river, the view, the ships, your beers. Relax about speedy service, this is not why you are here, just be glad you have a chair.And if it's too crowded, just get your basics from the counter and sit on the rocks or the sand.Don't expect any delicacies - some beers or Weinschorle, some fish rolls or so ... all not bad but certainly not great ... and some serious shipping on view. Kids playing in the sand between the tables.This is Hamburg."
4,What a lovely find. Great fish and daily specials all reasonably priced. Also very good mussels when they're in season. It's nice to sit outside in summer but the Glühwein stand in winter is pretty good too.
3,"Reservations are suggested but they were still able to seat our party of 4 when we walked in. The menu is in German. We enjoyed fricassee of chicken, white asparagus (seasonal item here) with ham, and German beer and wine. You pay for water which is served in a glass bottle (natural or still means without carbonated bubbles). We appreciated that they notified us that they were out of certain menu items and had substitutes to offer (i.e. alternate beef and fish entrees)."
4,"I came here for lunch around midday and there was plenty of space to sit as a group. Ordering through the tablets built into the table was novel but not perfect; I wanted the chili burger without cheese but the software didn't give me the option to take the cheese off. No big deal, I went with the Burgerlich burger instead. It was pretty good, although the brioche bun was a little sweet for me. I got a side of fries as well, which came with an excellent BBQ sauce (word of warning: the menu calls it 'Bullseye Sauce'. No idea why; maybe because it hits the spot?). The whole meal cost just under €8 and they gave out free apples on the way out, which was a nice touch.Good lunch spot and burger joint. I'll be back.Side note: if you're from the UK, this place is very similar to Byron."
4,"I haven't been here in a while (as I don't work in the area any longer) but I LOVED this place! GREAT food, nice service, good value and when the weather is nice you can sit outside. I must get back there.Delicious!"
1,"Well, where to start?? The company I work for had their traditional team lunch and I suggested the Hard Rock Cafe. Big mistake! I should have known to have waited a few months before going so that the staff learns what is needed and everyone there is comfortable. It opened at 12pm however we got there about 2 minutes before and waited behind the red rope. They didn't actually open the doors till about 12:05pm and even when they did that they were very slow with letting people in.We did ask ahead of time for a reservation but were told they do not take any at this time but in a few weeks. Our party of 18 got to the door and was offered to come into the bar area and wait for a few minutes till they arrange some tables for us. We had requested to sit outside on the roof but were told it was not open this day. Strange considering they push the fact they have this great roof deck and it was a really great summer day!!Finally after about 5 minutes of waiting inside we were seated upstairs in the Jimmy room. It was quite hot and this could have something to do with the fact it is located near the kitchen?? Our party of 18 was separated into 2 tables, each having their own server.We ordered our drinks promptly and received them a few minutes later. As soon as we received our drinks we ordered our meals. The server was obviously not familiar with the menu yet and we had to constantly point to the menu for her to read even though we spoke German to her.After about 1.5 hrs the food started to come out. However, it was coming out in spurts. A couple plates, waiting a few minutes, then a couple more. It then came down to the last 2 plates, (mine and another persons). After another 10 minutes his plate came and I was told mine was coming. In fact I had 3 different people come over and tell me it was coming. I was then given a plate of cold fries to keep me satisfied till it arrived.When it finally came, everyone else had already finished. I then asked for a box so I could just take it with me and was told it was not possible as they do not have take away boxes but she would ask anyway. While she was away I noticed the food on my plate was not resembling what I had ordered. I looked around and then asked for a menu and sure enough it was not what I ordered. I showed this to the server and instead of telling me she was sorry she just told me it was correct. I told her to please take it back and we would take the check.Another fact, we never got an apology from anyone. They did take off the cost of my food but that was it. Clearly this location is not yet fully up and running as it should be.I have been to many and the service and food is excellent. It should also be noted that the prices of the menu seem to be higher then the other locations as well. Everything seemed to be between 10 and 20€ and drinks between 6 and 10€.I will wait a couple months before going back and maybe then I will edit this review."
3,"I was hanging out with my freinds and suddenly saw this coffee shop in the another side of the street .The impression of me about it is the concept , which is minimal , bright and cute xD. As i went in , the smells of coffee beans rushed in my noé, so delightfully ! No complaint about the staffs , very gentle and friendly."
4,"This is my local Starbucks, practically across the street from my office. Starbucks...you know it. What should I write? If you like it, great. If not, go find something else. There's plenty of better cafes (in regards to taste of coffee) in Hamburg. At the same time, I get my wLAN here and can work well from the location. Plus it's definately one of the nicer Starbucks when it comes to interior. Don't forget to look up when ordering."
4,"Mr. Kebab is a turkish restaurant with an really accelent service. You can't compare it to the common opinion of turkish food, like Dönerbuden. Like I said, the service is brilliant and the food too. Yummie, really a lot and you can pay it. My advice: The Grillteller for two (it's enought for 3 easily even for 3 men) And: Got to the toilette there. It's an experience ;)"
4,"It is difficult when you traveling to Europe for business trip-this place is very, very good and so perfect."
4,"Spell binding and stunning, Hamburg's Art Museum (Kunsthalle) has all the golden greats, plus plenty of modern allsorts.Placed between the lake, the old town and the Station, it's easy to reach and suitably priced and really is a must see during any visit to Hamburg."
4,"Really liked the vibe, the service was fast. Sushi - amazing, great choices and varieties. The only not so good thing for me was the tempura, it wasnt hot and really greasy. Otherwise- definitely a great place to come on a Friday night!"
4,"Ah, vegetarian friends. Who'd have them? Not me for one! But on occasion I do have few visiting couchsurfers with an aversion to meat. For these moments, Azietona is a little gem, which is fortuitously located next to sofabar!"
4,Look on yelp to find restaurant near hotel crown plaza this was beyond my expectations service food presentation all 5 stars  the  hostess was so nice spoke English perfect (which I had hard x finding people who spoke English in Hamburg) husband and wife team !!!she hostess he chef great team We ate they 2 of the 3 days we were in Hamburg this is the kind of place that I hope to find in big city so if u r in Hamburg try it I know u will not be disappointed I had fish sea bass so so goodAlso dorado best in long x serve  with vegetable & salad Husband have schnitzel both night one pork one veal fried potatoes  and salad happy manAnd the price for a perfect meal was very reasonable
3,"Qrito: Original Californian Cuisine. They have burritos, quesadilla and tacos which you can fill with a wide choice of meat.Either with minced meat, finely chopped meat, orange/lime chicken, chocolate/nuts beef, and of course pork meet. Rice is also added, either lime or spanish, and a variety of vegetables and a sauce of your choice. It's a nice place, with an original idea.The Burrito and Quesadilla are HUGE. you need to be really hungry to eat it up!"
3,"Honestly some of the best Pho Soup and Noodles I have had outside the United States.  The restaurant, though very well located in the innerStadt, was small and very crowded for lunch.  Being a very cold March day in Hamburg having the door open and close at our backs was a bit uncomfortable, but the hot soups and tea mostly made up for it. One can tell that this is a family restaurant.  The service was very nice and fast.  If you are looking for a warm quick lunch this would be my #2 suggestion for Hamburg.  Guess I will have to make a new list!We ordered two green teas, which got cold rather quickly because they are served in bowls, but by the time they were too cold the soup and noodles were there.  I ordered #15, which was viggies in noodles, always one of my favorites. My friend ordered Pho with Shrimp.  We shared the spring rolls which I could tell were made and fried fresh, not frozen.Looking forward to a follow up lunch at Quan do!"
0,"I have been a regular customer for the last 2 years of this winebar somehow pleased by the cosy atmosphere of this place and the fact that is located close to where I leave. Friday 30th of July around 8:00 pm me and my gf have decided spontaneously to have a dinner again without booking a table.When we approached the queue a ""very kind"" girl at the entrance gently invited us to seat on a table in front of the entrance.Due to the fact that outside was very windy and cold and the front door was open to allow the people to enter we kindly denied to seat on that table (for the above reasons) asking to sit at the bar to have 1 or 2 drinks (as allowed to the couple in front of us in the queue) while waiting to have another table later on in the evening.Suddenly the girl clearly annoyed by our request has decided to show all the empathy skills acquired in this industry over the years and claimed that if we did not want to sit on that table we should have left the restaurant as they do not like to move people around tables...!!Coming from this business many years and having worked as a waiter during my studies in a multitude of restaurants in different countries it is shocking how you can people can even call this behaviour ""service"".My only request was to have 2 drinks at my expense while waiting for a table to be free later on in the same evening.I used to come to this place once a month with an average expense of 40 euro per person when in 2 and more when with other friends.This is the treatment you can get at the Vineyard in Hamburg even if you are a regular customer and horrifying it is actually a compliment.This is my first bad review I have ever left on Yelps but it is crucial that everybody have a clear picture of the venue you are visiting before deciding to spend the evening and your money.From my side they will never see me again!"
4,"I try to visit HH at least once a year and Mo-Grill is always one of my first stops after I get to the city. Of course, we all know from reading ""The Invention of Curried Sausage"" novella by Uwe Timm that Currywurst was first created in Hamburg and the claims by Berlin are quatsch. The food at Mo-Grill is great -- served fast and hot by friendly folks and their expansion has not affected the quality. There's also a peculiar Hamburg ambiance with everyone standing around small tables eating with lots of people walking past. Nothing like it anywhere else!"
0,"So after five months in Hamburg, I was finally overcome by my desire for a decent burger. Where would I go? I decided to go to The Bird after studying reviews on Tripadvisor and on other fora. In the end it all comes down to the meat, the bun, the cheese, the fries. They're a friendly, well intentioned bunch, but the vast lump of churned meat at the core of The Bird just does come up to standard when it comes to taste or texture. There is no 'bite', it's almost as if the meat has been reduced to the texture and feel of sausage meat. Perhaps they are catering to local tastes. Perhaps there are constrained by local produce. I don't know the reason. I would love to have been able to give them a good review. I would have loved to have had a reliable burger on my new doorstep. But I am afraid that the guys down at The Bird, friendly though they are, just do not know how to make a burger, their core product. Sorry."
3,"Cool bar on Bartelsstraße in the Schanze district of Hamburg. It's quite dark, with semi-comfy leather seating around the edges of the room, and inoffensive beats. The main attraction on a Tuesday night is the happy hour cocktails until 2200. I have to stress that happy hour in Germany is not the same as the UK - they are not half price. You're talking around EUR 4.50 for a caprhina and slightly more for a mojito - but they are very very good cocktails. You can order at the bar and then get them brought over to you, so you are free to enjoy the trippy electronic fish tank! This is the centrepiece of the bar, and has shallow water in which you can put your fingers and get the fish to chase you! I've never seen anything like it..."
2,"What I like about this place:1) they give you unagi sauce and mayo with the soy sauce which both taste great! 2) The sushi are Creative and pretty overwhelming in taste. What I dislike:1) The Service and staff is absolutely ridiculous. I understand you guys got some fame now though online ratings but the staff truly doesn't give a shit about you. First time we came we asked if the kitchen is still open if we come in 20 minutes. They said yes, we arrived in 15 minutes to find out their kitchen closed. No apology, just a ""well you've to come earlier"" (but I just talked to you on the phone). Second time we came 2 orders were taken incorrectly and they made us feel guilty about not telling them right away when we got the sushi (well, it all looks the same to us) 2) The sushi quality is middle class. Don't go with the nigiri you'll be disappointed. It's not worth the price. Conclusion: if you like fancy special rolls, you love it when it's saucy - this place is worth to check out. The taste of the special rolls are great! If you care about having a good experience or authentic or quality sushi. Skip this place. Note that parking is a catastrophe! What we ordered and liked ranked from most favorite to least favorite:1) Unique Lady roll (was good!) 2) Crazy Man Roll (nice Sauce that tastes a bit like Marmelade) 3) Hot Strong Tempura roll (would skip) 4) Crispy dream roll (definitely skip)"
3,"Vegetarian, but surprisingly not bad! The Eggs Benedict was great with potatoes and fruit cup. The entire staff was all female which was really cool. They were working very, very hard. Service was kind of slow, but that may be a German thing. Not much seating. I had ice water, which they didn't try to sell me a pricey bottle...nice. Freshly squeezed OJ and hand-spun shakes. This is a local favorite restaurant. The neighborhood is kind of suspect, but definitely OK during the day when w went. This was truly home cooking. I would go here again, bring a guest and recommend to a friend (but prepare them all with a description of the place)"
3,I have heard repeatedly from my internal monologue as I walk past cafe May that they do good cocktails of an evening.  I have yet to experience them.  10/10 review. Would read again.
1,"This place is a trendy hipster coffee and brunch place. The coffee is very good, the food as well. The decor and look of the place is great. I've been there twice now and the issue is the feel. I felt treated by the hostess not like a customer that should be treated friendly and be welcomed but rather like someone who is lucky to even make it into the door. We got there a few minutes before opening time (10 am for a breakfast place -- weird by itself) and stood in line. She let in about a dozen people. When it was our (my daughter and I) turn she assigned us ""the couch"". Folks that came after us still got tables.  We went to the couch which is an old style leather couch with an old suitcase as table. Very uncomfortable. As we sat there uncomfortably, tables got served first. In addition there were at least 4-5 tables unused. So I went back to her and asked why we were sent to ""the couch"" whereas folks that came right after us got a table. Begrudgingly she said that we could take a table but that they all were reserved, some starting at 11 am, some much later. It was 10:15 am! We didn't plan on spending an hour there so took the table. We noticed several of the other unused tables had ""reserved"" on them with the time of reservation up to 12:30 pm!! Crazy! Anyway, we had our coffee and food (avocado toast which was tasty) and were out of there by 10:50 am. It's poorly managed in terms of seating, with a super snooty attitude from the hostess. Unwelcoming. A few suggestions: drop the attitude and treat people nicely. Get rid of the couch and add more tables. Get rid of the reservation deal for 2-4 people. Early bird gets the worm, especially in a breakfast place! Reservations should only be used for big groups (6 or more) with plenty of walk-in slots."
0,"Terrible! Probably the worst T-Bone steak I've ever had. It shouldn't even be called T-Bone steak. The staff is weird as well. Avoid this place -- definitely not worth your money. Block House, Meatery and Schlachterbörse may cost a bit more, but are totally worth the money. FAIL!"
4,One of my favourite places! Always get he chicken tikka and samosas!  Nice food for a cheap price! It can be really crowded and a bit of a wait when you go at a busy hour but at the right time it's great!
2,"It's right around the corner from where i live.It's a cozy small place. I've been there only a couple of times, but i walk past it very often.Not much is happening in there, its barely ever full, usually has 2 or 3 guests.However the food tastes ok.I've had the Naschmarkt Salat for 8,50 EURIt has avocado and turkey. It's really really good. Its not the place to be, but if you are bored from the same restaurants, why not try Jolie for a change!"
2,It was good to try German traditional type of foods. I liked the restaurant itself and so on. But the fish was very salty for me maybe it's because I'm not German
3,"Near the Hbf in Hamburg and it's worth a short walk for a 4 euro meal, and 5 if you get an Ayran! Durum is like a giant burrito with chicken and beef, assorted veg and sauce. Ask for ""scharf"" or spicy and it has a nice little kick. Is it a 4 star meal? Not even close, but for a fast and filling meal before hopping on a train or after a stadtrundfahrt this is a deal. You could even split a durum and it would fill up two people and save even more money! I'm not on a budget, but I liked what I found here. Enjoy!"
3,"Not accurately Mexican food, but very tasty and very inspired by it nonetheless. Tasty sauces with great tortilla chips, spicy burritos.We love to order from here.If your aren't lookin for authentic tacos, you are good here. They do not have any tacos unfortunately."
4,Perfekt und sehr lecker!
4,"Absolute professional and lovely, remembers most customers favourite orders, makes good jokes and even has some books for kids."
4,Savage spot with great food/service and good Guinness and i know a good Guinness.
3,"It'sbeen ages since I was at Panter last time. To my satisfaction my visityesterday confirmed that: a) this place is as cool as it was before b) cosy, unpretentious, good quality c) friendly service d) unfortunately limitedchoice of drinks, i.e. wine This place will suite you if you are looking for a nice & cosy place to have a coffee and chat. It's not spectacular, just good."
3,"PRICEY but it's 20upThis bar is inside of the Riverside Hotel at the highes floor of this buidling. It's worth your time, especially at night while sipping at your 13€ cocktail and enjoying this wonderful panorama view of Hamburgs waterfront through the large windows starting on the ground and going all the way up to the ceiling.Visiting this place is a mix of:Relaxing, spending time with friends, dressed business casual, seeing Hamburg from a different angle, enjoying the drinks and emptying your wallet.No need for reservation, just wait in line.(Only 4 Stars because I don't like to empty my wallet.)"
3,Pretty good Pho which is perfect for Hamburg's normal overcast weather. I too love their spring rolls!
2,their pasta and pizza of the day with Apple soda during lunch time is a good deal (around 6 to 7 eur).
4,"Went to Das Dorf yesterday to have my BDay dinner. it was GREAT! I even got my Wunderkerze plus the obligatory service team cuddle (check out my pic). had Hamburg's traditional Labskaus (google it by yourself he..he..he..) and it turned out to be my BEST Labskaus so far. Highly recommended. as for the atmosphere: very cozy with dimmed lights, antique furniture and silver"
0,"Burgers are ok. Cheesecake is good.Gave it a second chance to make up for the 1st time... But...Service is still HORRIBLE. 30 minutes in between even seeing a server. Bartenders running food. No method to the madness. This place is understaffed, over sat and mismanaged. 2.5 full hours from seating till payment of check for a BURGER. that's insanity.I won't be back to endure another waste of an evening"
4,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a couple months back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have the like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Now that it's getting warmer out, I'm glad they have the tables outside. It's usually packed at noon so the outdoor seating allows things to overflow to the outdoors a bit. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Today for example had the coconut mild and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
2,Very simple Asian imbis with afordable prices. You can eat and drink well for under 7EUR. Staff is quite friendly but if you are one of those people who can't stand spicy food than this place is not reccomendable. Almost everything there is made of chilli.
0,"Really bad cappuccino. We got a quiche each which was served with salad. In my opinion it was overpriced and not tasty.We went there because of the excellent reviews this place got, but i really dont see why this is ranked as one of the best brunch places in Hamburg. Not recommended"
4,"Kardelen must be doing something right to have a line out the door at lunch every day of the week. And I think it's a great place for casual Turkish food, too, but I have to admit that I'm a little puzzled about why it's so popular. The menu is incredibly long. This is mostly because they serve a handful of foods (Döner meat, falafel, veggies, various casseroles) in various formats (plates, wraps, sandwiches), and every single permutation is on the menu.The food itself is really good, and everything is prepared at the moment you order it, so you can customize as you like with sauces and other special requests. I usually get a Döner in bread or in a wrap (durum), but the other dishes look great, too. As mentioned, there is always a huge line. However, they are good at moving orders quickly, and even getting a seat in the packed dining room isn't all that hard. I do wish they were less popular and had more space/capacity, but that's just part of the Kardelen experience."
0,"I went here for food last night. I'd been before but only for drinks so was looking forward to trying the food. The place was busy enough for a Sunday evening. Sat down at the table at 5:45 and ordered food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly enough but then it went downhill. At 7:00 we still had no food. Our waitress noticed this and went to find out about our food and came back to tell us they forgot our order! As our hunger levels were high and we were in such a bad mood with the service we asked for the bill for the drinks so we could go somewhere else. The waitress apologised and didn't charge us for the drinks. In fairness, I don't think it was all her fault. There wasn't enough staff working for the amount of people in the place. All the staff that were working looked stressed out and were running all over the place serving people. This might have had something to do with their rudeness! If they had more staff working things would probably run more smoothly. I've family and friends visiting Hamburg next month and wanted to take them here but I'm not going to now. It's a shame because the place is really nice and the food that I did see on other tables looked really good."
4,"A small ""fast-food"" restaurant with a great flair and delicious Burritos (also very spicy if you want though)! I can only recommend to go there, but be careful : you have to pick a good moment because it is really often full and you will have to wait a little bit..."
3,"Really good dim sum. Some of the best I've had in Hamburg. In truth I regret not getting more of the main dishes here. I had a few with aubergines that were actually really good and would have liked to order more.But what can I say about the dim sum here? Chicken feet, rice rolls and dumplings oh my! Well worth a 20-min U-bahn to get here and enjoy this places specialties."
4,"Excellent food, service, and ambiance. The price went up to 6.50 EUR, but the generous portions and quality of food is still the same. I hope the restaurant realizes that students and tourists on a tight budget rely on this place to continue offering great service and delicious meals for a reasonable price."
3,"Great place for American breakfast: pancakes with maple syrup, eggs&bacon, coffee. Very casual and cool atmosphere. Americana-mania reached Hamburg! A bit too loud and not cheap. Definitely worth going once in a while, but not the healthiest choice for regular consumption."
4,"Theres something very dark and mysterious about this place that captures the imagingation. The selection of absinthe is remarkable, and the ordering process adds to the feel of mystery. The bar tender is fantastic, offering advice to the novice drinker (me) on what to have, which will aptly suit my pallette. Just brilliant...a unique experience and one which will definately be enjoyed again"
2,"Nice food and great service, wasn't a fan of one of their dishes but that's just personal choice (I ordered two dishes just in case). Service was quick, friendly staff and the pizza sizes are massive."
3,"Came here with my wife on a Wednesday night, and we were surprised by the 20 minute queue.  From the smells going around, we can understand why.It's a small space that is stylishly designed reminding of Ramen houses we've been to in Vancouver, BC.  We ordered the katsu don which was a little greasy and on the large side, but it was still crispy.  My wife had the special shio ramen, and I had the special miso ramen.  The shio ramen stock was much lighter than we were used to, but it was good after cracking the tamago and mixing around the yolk.  The miso ramen was fantastic.  Great creamy broth and a little spicy. Is it the best ramen restaurant I've been to?  I would say no, since we've been to ones in London, Seattle, and Vancouver.  For having this place in Hamburg, it's the most authentic thing I've had in a long time.  Big plus that the servers speak Japanese.  We're adding this to our monthly rotation of restaurants for sure."
4,"Don't really understand the bad reviews, cause I  really liked this bar! They play really good music and have an underground disco section. If you don't want wait behind the crowd to get your drinks by the main bar, you can go underground to get your drinks there as it was way less busy.Prices are decent and staff is friendly.  If I visited Hamburg again I'd probably return!"
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this place considering how long I've regularly been coming here. This is my favorite breakfast place in Hamburg. My favorite seats are in back, upstairs. This place has been a staple for me almost 10 years now. Used always come here when visiting Hamburg and before moving here. Awesome breakfasts, super nice staff, easy location, and great atmosphere. I've only been here for breakfast and can't say much about the rest of the day, but I have yet to be disappointed here."
4,A good quick overview of Indian food and taste in the center of Hamburg. Super cheap small 4.90 and large portion 6.90. Totally recommend this place if you are a tourist and would want a quick food. Very crowded
4,mr t burger changed my life! chipotle chilli sauce is digusting but every taste is different. the portion of sweet potatoe fries is too small for 4 EUR. overall its one of the best burger i had so far. thanks mates!
4,"YAAASSSS!!!! It can be hard to find this place that's hidden away in a shady-looking building, but do yourself a favor and go! Have some almond coffee, a slice of cheese cake and feel the atmosphere of cool northern Germany. This is hipster in the best way possible and a pleasure to visit. Discreet place, but bursting with atmosphere."
3,"Had a great dinner here last night. I'm going to go ahead and give them 4 stars even though I do have two things to quib about. Were these resolved they easily get 5 stars. One is the fact that they have a ventilation system which is necessary to keep the place from stinking like the kitchen. At the same time, this creates a draft on half the seats which really isn't something you want. We had to change seats in the hope of not waking up the next day with sore necks. Luckily we received a table upstairs and had the whole level to ourselves which was very much to our liking. Second complaint is the wine pricing. By the glass, you only get 0,1 servings at prices which are usually for 0,2 size servings. Not a major big deal but still kind of high for the rest of the menu's very positive notes. There is also a 0,25 size serving but for two people this is also poor sizing. Anyway, these were very minor complaints on my end. On a very positive note service here is great. Super nice waitress who was more than attentive the whole evening and very helpful in making choices off the menu. We both had the pasta with truffles which was really good. Further, and I usually wouldn't comment on this, the bread served was amazing. Super tasty and warm which when eaten with the high quality olive oil rounded out our meal nicely. We also had dessert and were very impressed. We ordered the pistachio tarte and the chocolate tart which were both filled with creamy fillings. Dessert was the highlight of the meal. The interior is still, after being open a year, like new. I really like the mix of styling and it's a very comfortable atmosphere (outside of the draft). We'll definitely be back soon as this could easily become a favorite Italian place in the Innenstadt. I am making a point of coming back and trying it out for lunch when I have business appointments."
3,Good: Strong modern vietnamese dishes. Tasty and unique.Not so good: Portions ran on the medium-smaller side. We just had to order more.
3,"I wouldn't normally go to a restaurant this close to the Reeperbahn, but a colleague assured me that this place was worth it, and boy was he right! I can't remember the exact name of the dish, but it was pasta with meatballs or perhaps sausage meat and it was amazing. Probably the best pasta I've had in Hamburg. The location is a bit odd (you have to dodge the local prostitutes to get there), but once inside it's nicely decorated and they even have a small outdoor area out the back for those warm summertime evenings. The food is a bit more pricey than most Italian restaurants in Hamburg. A pasta dish will set you back about EUR10 and a meat or fish dish will be more like EUR20. Overall: great food, odd location."
1,"I must say that I am disappointed. I saw a few cakes that looked great on the pictures on yelp so we decided to have a break there and try two of these. But when we arrived in the store, none of these cakes were here, and actually none of the cakes present that day seemed interesting to us. We ended up taking one slice for two because we both couldn't find something that looked very appealing to us. We ended up with a hazelnut cake with a cassis icing on it. Unfortunately the cake itself was dry and the cassis icing wasn't really good either... We both didn't like it much (and trust me my boyfriend is a sweet-addict, it's pretty hard for him not to like anything sweet..)"
0,"Absolutely disappointing.Burgers barely have any substance, the homemade ice tea was terrible and there is no service"
3,"Swedish restaurants are pretty rare, so I guess this one goes all in on being Swedish. First of all its logo is some kind of a Dala horse, a symbol of Sweden. And inside you have Lilla Åland chairs (well, fake replicas most likely), probably the most popular chair design from Sweden. So the atmosphere and interior makes me feel like I'm at home.I have only tried the meatballs here, and I like them. If you want a heavy meal and like potatoes, I think you'll like this place and its food too."
4,High ball drinks bring back the good old times!!
3,"A good zoo. This place has been run idependantly by the Hagenbeck family for over 100 years and still has a nice, family run feel to it despite its size. They now also have a Troparium with more tropical animals including aligators and sharks. probably best to do the two parts of the park on different visits due to the cost. U2 line or various buses to Hagenbeck's."
3,"Cozy coffeehouse near points of interest in Hamburg! The atmosphere was warm and bright, and the caramel macchiato was well worth the long wait.That was our only complaint; the shortage of servers made our wait very long, first to put in our order, and then even longer to get our drinks. At least it was a respite from the gray, rainy Saturday outside, and I would get another large caramel macchiato from them anytime! (Well, anytime that I have plenty of time to wait;).)"
4,"If you are in Hamburg, and you don't eat lunch or dinner here, I'm gonna be mad at you.Totally perfect. Don't miss it. Great food, great English speaking staff! I had the Maultauchen app and it was awesome, a dumpling filled with meat and spinach. Outstanding flavor. I then moved on to the meatloaf and Spätzle, which was the best I've had in years. The sauce over it all was to die for! I might come back for dinner tonight!"
4,"All this time I thought the bratwurst I had back home was delicious...not even close to what I had here in Germany. The real stuff is amazing! They don't serve it like a hot dog either, just a roll on the side and it is juicy and tasty. I'm gonna need another one before I leave. Soooooooo good!"
3,"This is a great place in Hamburg to sit and eat with friends. It's pretty packed, but if you hang around it long enough, you can get a place to sit.  I'd say this place is more north Vietnamese than southern, which means the dishes are presented and named differently, but it's so slight most people won't even notice/care. The pho here is different than most other Vietnamese restaurants: you don't get a side dish of bean sprouts, lime, chilis and herbs to add to you soup.This isn't a downside in my opinion, because the soup gets there fast and is beautifully satisfying.Since all the pho is 6.50 (a freaking steal if you ask me), I got pho tôm, which was pretty damn good. My friends all had Bún (pork, beef & tofu). I tried the tofu bún and it was truly amazing. I will probably get it the next time I'm here. The drinks were all good, both the lemonades and the red sake mojito are freshly made.All in all (tl;dr), it's a nice casual place to go and sit with friends and eat, drink & talk. I'm sure it's even nicer in the summer months with outdoor seating and slower tempo. The only downside was the waitress, she was a bit curt and heavy-handed, but I'm sure she'd had a long day. In the end we didn't mind it because the food was good and the service was fast."
4,"DaCaio is my favorite place to eat when I travel to Hamburg.  There is a dish called ""Del Boss"" that is consistently mind blowing and I think about it longingly when I'm far from Hamburg.  Check it out, you don't be disappointed.  Also had the tagliatelle for the first time today at lunch and it too was incredible!  Love it!"
4,"Great location, tasty and cheap burgers, long queues, not enough seats. But there is always an option to get food takeaway and sit next to Alster!"
2,We went here due to the yelp reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as expected. The food was only ok and the waitress didn't speak German or English. With a lot of pointing at the menu we got the food we wanted. I guess that during the week there is more staff and the food is better.
4,"I went for the breakfast there... Very very happy about it! It is a buffet, cheap, with a lot of choice (even for vegetarians). I can only recommend it!"
3,"We decided to give this place a try. It was located almost right in front of our hotel. There were only ten dishes on their menu, which was a good sign.We were there rather late. There were no customers, so we were served right away by the waiter. He offered us ""today's special"" which was crispy duck in sweet and sour sauce (predictable) and chicken in yellow curry sauce.The chicken dish was delicious, simply because the type of the yellow curry they use was not like the Thai yellow curry.It was more like the Indonesian's yellow curry, pretty light, tasted almost like the dish called ""Gulai nangka."" I was quite surprised of how similar the taste was. The choices of the vegetarian that they used for the dish was perfect. Carrot, zucchini, eggplants, baby corn, and yardlong bean, oh... and slices of chilies (d(-_^)good!!)I wasn't wild about the other dish, but I have already guessed it, since I usually don't like both the taste and consistency, of sweet and sour sauce. While we were waiting for our orders, the waiter told us a rather sad history.It was about, how hard was the reality 20 years ago, when he first migrated to German.He sailed with a big ship, together with thousand other illegal immigrants, from Vietnam. Many did not survive the long journey."
4,"We have a 1 year old that's constantly moving, so lately we've been getting a lot of meals to go. We went in on Sunday, a little after 9 am. Oma's staff was super nice when we asked for the food to go and also got us coffee while we waited. I've not been impressed with some of the  coffee I've tried so far in the neighborhood, but this was wonderful. I really liked the restaurant itself. Just laid back and cozy. Would've loved to actually stay and eat there if not for the toddler. I'm sure it would've been fine if we had stayed, but it's just not fun for us to eat and chase him at the same time. The food itself was great. Pancakes/maple syrup and Breakfast 1. Exactly what we wanted on a Sunday morning."
2,"We ate here at lunch time. It was busy but as we arrived early we were served speedily. I enjoyed my meal and the waiter was friendly. Ok its not the best Italian restaurant I have visited but if you are nearby and want something pleasant to eat , it will fit the bill"
2,"This restaurant was my saving grace while I was in Hamburg, and while it wasn't exactly American fare, it got the job done.I was staying in the hotel right next to here, so on cold nights, it was such a relief to finish up my training and duck into Jim Block's to grab a carry out burger. The first night I went, I made the mistake of getting a BBQ burger. The BBQ sauce was less than pleasant and I welcome all Germans to swing over to the US sometime to try a taste of our BBQ, because you won't want to go back ;-). The fries I had were tasty and I appreciated that they offered mayo and ketchup in easy little plastic packs. The 2nd night, having learned my lesson, I got an ordinary cheeseburger which was quite good. I also go a baked potato instead of fries and that was outstanding. Hot, salty, soft, and served with an ample side of sour cream, this really hit the spot on a cold night!I would definitely come back to Jim Block again for dinner in Hamburg!"
4,"If you plan to visit Takumi, you should definitely come 15 - 20 minutes before its opening hours. The tables are arranged for 2-4 persons. We have been 8 people and the staff let us rearrange the tables so we can all sit together. The waiters were very considerate of the customers, so we didn't really habe to wait for one to take our orders. Even though we have been a big group, the food arrived very fast and everyone got their ramen at the same time. I ordered  'Karaage' and the 'Yuzu Shio Ramen' with soybean sprouts and an egg. The karaage was a decent portion for an entree. I was pretty amazed by the ramen. The soup base and the noodles were very delicious! I wasn't a big fan of the egg though because it was pretty cold. To sum it up, I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for some delicious ramen to pay Takumi a visit!"
4,Very cool place. Entrance is 10 euros (less for children). It was very interesting seeing all the cars (and the progression of the car through history). I would definitely recommend doing this. The staff was also very helpful and were able to speak English.There is also a small café and gift shop.
3,"I liked this bar, a quiet (ish) place to meet and chat to friends whilst enjoying a drink on the many sofas. Cool mix of all types of people, with the bar staff being friendly and proffessional (one having the nicest haircut my girlfriend had ever seen - what this has to do with a review I have no idea). Good cheap drinks and the only place I have found that has the perfect music levels. You can still talk without shouting, listen to the music, without it being overbearing and relax and enjoy yourself. However, like Laurisija said, its not THE reason to go out, but its a nice place to meet before heading off somewhere else, or just to chat to friends during the week."
3,"Little surprised to see this place get only 3.5 stars, since I think pretty much everything about it is great. (""Yay! I'm a fan,"" even.)Ambience: trendy, modern - great lighting.Food: well-prepared, nicely presented. The fruit with muesli for breakfast is a choice way to start the day; the half-salad/half-soup lunch combo was fantastic the day I had it.Coffee: Does the job! They also have a pretty full range of espresso drinks."
2,The english breakfast was suitable and quick. Other than the waitress who seemed to hate life this place was satisfactory.
3,"It seems kinda weird that I'm writing the first (English) review of the main Hamburg beach. But I guess there's not all that much to say: It's a sandy beach on the banks of the Elbe in Hamburg. A few notes:- A nice way to get here is to take the ferry from Landungsbrucken.- Be careful when you're near the water's edge. See that container ship going past in the distance? It moves a lot of water, and can cause some surprising waves- There are permanent barbeques on the beach.- There are public toilets- There are restaurants nearby"
3,"The fried spring rolls had crispy perforated wrappers and a solid meat and vegetable filling. The sweet Thai chili sauce accompanying it was straight out of the bottle, but tasted better when tweaked with the house pickled chili and garlic on the table. The Summer rolls were tight and served sushi style. The peanut sauce that came with it was good.The Pho Bo (beef) broth was actually really good. Noodle texture and thin sliced beef were all excellent. And the shredded herbs added a balance and interest to the flavors. The fried dough stick was a lovely authentic homage to how Pho is served in Vietnam, and a fun dipping companion for the broth.Caphe s'ua da (iced coffee) was fragrant, espresso strong and served unmixed so you can see the seductive dark brown hue. But evaporated milk was used--refined, but I much prefer the sweetened condensed milk versions."
4,"This was my go-to coffee spot in Hamburg. Missing it to this day.Great location, really nice staff and the coffee is just amazing. I still dream of the perfect double-shot Americanos I got from here.This plus a few other places alone would make Hamburg worth a trip."
3,"Very pleasant deli cum bistro overlooking the new concert hall in Hafencity. When building is complete, this will be a great location. Right now, as with many of the places in hafencity you sit partially in the midst of a building site. Not dirty, but certainly noisy. But with tasty salads, expertly cooked pasta (and the not tried but good looking flammkuchen and tartines) this is still a really good lunch spot. And watching Hafencity go up around you is perhaps part of the charm!"
0,Walked in with 2 friends and was seated in a good seat by the window.  3 minutes later another waiter came up and demanded we move to another table same size but in the back by the busy kitchen and bathroom stairs.  He was rude about it and could have just taken one of the chairs we had if he needed it for other people.  Who cares about the food when the atmosphere starts with a rude slap in the face.
3,"The perfect place in Hamburg to sit and have a coffee/wine/beer and soak in the scene. Please forgive my American-ness but this joint is quintessential European. I felt like I was in a movie every time I walked by/sat for a drink. Fantastic people watching, clean bathrooms, speedy & courteous service. Babies, old people, young people, hipster parents, men that wear red pants, you can find them all here."
3,"One of my favorite restaurants in Hamburg, and especially for fish! Great selection of fish (grilled or with a light sauce) for reasonable prices. Sides are pretty plain, but I've enjoyed the fish whenever I've been there (I haven't tried much else). Nice Spanish/Portuguese flair with cozy deco and atmosphere!! Service is usually a bit slow, but it's a nice place to go out for the evening."
4,"After having eaten at Thai Cowboys in the Sternschanze area of Hamburg, I decided to try out this one and see if it was up to the same high standard. The staff were friendly, and when they could see that I couldn't find what I wanted on the menu board, I was asked what I was looking for. When I told them I wanted something with squid, I was told that they didn't do anything with squid, but if I really wanted it, they would be happy to fulfil my wish. The result was absolutely delicious, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending you try this. It's an ""imbiss"" rather than a restaurant, so don't be expecting silver service. If all you want is top-notch Thai at a ""gunstig"" price, then you've found the place."
4,"Classy, great seafood. Really good restaurant serving some fish specialities from Hamburg."
4,"We have been here several times and really like it for grabbing a quick bite on the way out to do something or when coming home and wanting to grab something quick.I usually have the number eleven chicken wrap and like to get a couple of pieces of haloumi  chucked in, this is a tasty combo.We also really rate the falafel teller, all the flavours and textures on it really go well together.There is coffee and cold drinks (most importantly Spezi)There is seating inside and out, and a customer toilet.  The guy running the place is also very pleasant."
4,"I know it says it's the biggest miniature train exhibit, but it's so much more than that! It's the worlds largest miniature model, yes there are trains, but there is also a fully functioning miniature airport with planes taking off and landing, taxying to their gates and later taking off again. There are waterways with miniature ships going around. And so much built around the trains that they actually become more of a background and the main selling point. This place is stunning in its love to detail and the plethora of jokes and social commentary you can find throughout the miniature structures. Knuffingen, the made-up name of a city that's a large part of the exhibit, and Knuffingen Airport are only the beginning, there are also Austrian, Scandinavian, Swiss and American themed exhibits as well as a large Hamburg model. They are also currently building an Italian and a France themed area. This place keeps continually growing.If you look closely, you'll find so many amazing little details that are just so much fun to find. Keep a lookout for all the little cows hidden in every single exhibit! The American landscapes also have quite a few aliens populating their own little town.Many places throughout the exhibits feature buttons you can press to trigger some action, there's a joust, an outdoor festival, a Christmas market and so much more. Definitely take your time when you go here.Between the various areas, there are smaller exhibition pieces as well as information on the technical aspect. Every spare space in the Miniature Wunderland is used to perfection.The models are also updated according to current events, whether it's all of Hamburg celebrating Germany winning the World Cup or the train station being occupied by striking train drivers, the models keep on changing and it's wonderful.Always worth a visit, whether you're a local or a tourist! Also, they have Mario and Princess Peach on their restroom doors, so yeah, they're just really really awesome!"
1,Too bad. I was not impressed. I had the Rotbarsch Filet. It was greatly disappointing. Absolutely no flavor. The portion was meager. There was a lot more Kartoffelsalat than fish on the plate. Definitely will not go again.
3,Best lunch place in the area. The Pizza is delicious and the price is unbeatable... For just 4€ you get the classics like Salami etc.At night time the place is usually packed and you have to expect some waiting time. Even with a reservation which gets you wondering why they bother to take them in the first place. With the check comes a complementary bottle (!) of Sambuca... which not too bad (except for the morning afterwards).The focus on the menu really are the pizzas. Just once tried some pasta and it was average at best. So don't even think about anything else.
3,"Young, fresh, cozy as well as dynamic place.Very good and friendly service.We had poached eggs with avo, pesto, spinach on bread. Delicious!Waffle, other bread and dishes look perfect as well.Coffee (espresso and cappuccino) were excellent.The home made maracuja lemonade was just refreshing WOW!One star reduction, as we wait for 30 minutes (ok, I didn't know before). Reservation online only and no table free the next two weeks.In general perfect for the business. However not for spontaneous brunch people."
3,I visited this Italian restaurant on my first trip to Germany. Our seat was right in front of the brick oven which was great to see and also the man making the pizza was most entertaining with his singing.  I had a large beer and a tomato and mozzarella appetizer. Let's not forget the main dish a large pizza pie with all the works. If you are not a big eater remember to share. If you have been longing to devour a large pizza pie on your own. Order and dive right in. I will be back on my next trip to Germany with my family.
3,"great food for a reasonable price, also pretty handy as it is situated next to the university."
3,Nice amusement if you want to kill some time on a rainy day. Very fair ticket prices.
4,"Dank stinking grungy hole of a bar. Which I like. We saw a pretty intense gig on Saturday night (experi-mental rock), hooked up with some randoms and crashed a house party afterwards. If you don't like overheated, overcrowed hellholes... stay away!"
4,This is definitely my best Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Fresh seafood served right at the table. Much better than some sushi places in the town.
3,Good food and good shots. Be prepared because you can end up drunk just before starting with the free shots the friendly waiters pour for you!
4,"Great Burger. I went to a place called Peter Pane my first day in Hamburg and this place blows it out the water. Fresh Ingedients, Fresh Beef, Great combinations, very good burger. The only thing I didnt care for was the long wait for our food, but the place was crowded and understandably so. I recommend this place if you want a Hamburger in Hamburg!"
2,"The massive Hofbräuhaus on Esplanade seem to aim towards a traditional Bavarian experience. The entire eatery looks to be extremely traditional in terms of interior design and service, the menu selection is mainly Bavarian (with a few other European dishes thrown in for good measure). We were a group of about 10 at lunchtime and had no trouble getting a large table. Service was prompt and the food arrived quickly. The food was satisfying and affordable (some of us had a large schnitzel with fries for 5eu). Very nice, traditional, home-style cooking and all-around a good comfortable place to have lunch in groups of all sizes. Highly recommended! EDIT:It looks like I'm going to have to bring the rating down for this place. During our last visit, service was non-existent despite the restaurant being relatively empty, and the waiter refused to serve me tap water. Refusing to serve tap water is actually against German law, and in general a big no-no - shame on you, Hofbräuhaus."
4,"As a big fan of all things Middle Eastern, I can appreciate good falafel. The food served at Falafel Haus is simply great; nothing chewy or dry, like in those drunk-food döner places. The falafel is freshly fried, their hummus is delicious, the prices more than fair, and the service is friendly and quick.I would highly recommend it as the best falafel I've had in Europe!"
3,"I like that cafe. They have good food, the service is nice, you can sit outside and the prices are decent. They also have a good breakfast with huge rolls. The last time we came here we had the panino turkey arugula and the chicken with mashed potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and loads of hollandaise sauce. So good!:) Both. Also the neighborhood is great, alternative, cool stores... Love the 'Schanze'."
2,Convenient and easy but the döner meat isn't the best... there are better places in town. The service is okay. The other snacks are okay. The seating is. Good.
3,"A really nice place for Sunday brunch in Hamburg.Considering its position just a stone's throw from the Rathausmarkt and Neuer Wall, it could easily use the same tactic as nearby places such as Alex at the Alsterpavillon or Mio on Jungfernstieg where the sheer number of tourists mean that they can ramp up prices and largely ignore good service.However at Melange this doesn't seem to be the case. For the equivalent of EUR10 per person for a hungry family of four we enjoyed a large range of breads, tea, hot chocolate, meats, cheeses, scrambled egg, croissants, Schwartzbrot, a glass of prosecco. Delicious!So you can sit in one of four places; either outside alongside the water (ask for blankets if you are cold), inside on the ground floor, but recommended especially on a cold day is the inside upper floor where there is a nice buzz and friendly crowd of tourists and locals plus it has a smaller outdoor balcony too. It's actually open from 9am on Sundays (earlier than many places) and from 10.30 gets really busy so expect a slight wait after this time.On the whole the staff are friendly and efficient, speak English and were very kind to our children."
4,"Love this bar! Great vibe, surprisingly awesome food, some really good craft beer on tap and it's in a cute area."
4,"I went here last night with my family and we all absolutely loved this place! I got the spätzle with pesto,rocket and cherry tomatoes. The spätzle was perfectly flavored and had just the right amount of cheesiness. The cheese spätzle was also delicious. 5 stars, no doubts."
4,"Do not let the cheap prices misguide you. You'll be getting premium stakes here !!!I ordere rib-eye 300 he and my god what a beauty. The searing and crust was great, the seasoning was really good and the meat had a nice marbleIng too. The side dishes were also nice but honestly I was here for a good steak and I got one."
4,"Good reviews, although surrounded by soulless chain options down in the belly of the former state bank's mall: obviously had to try this!A very friendly greeting, and you sense immediately that this is an authentic, handmade place. Competitive prices: a mix of 3 different tacos plus a drink (do go for the sugar free homemade lemonade) will be 10€, the daily lunch option just 7€ with drink. But you will also want the freshly made (fresh as in: they make it right in front of you) guacamole.The tacos are excellent - not sophisticated excellent, but Mexico taco stall excellent. The lemonade tastes like the model every lemonade everywhere should taste like. And the guacamole, well, could just be more of it!The location in a food court is as pedestrian as they come, but if you sit inside, with the back to the court, it actually feels like the hand built taco stall it is, with colorful chairs, great music, and thick stone bowls for that guacamole.Please also add some Baja-style fish taco to your menu!!Will absolutely be back, don't go away."
4,"Ti Breizh is one of the first places I attempted going out to eat after being diagnosed with celiac. Since all their savory galettes are 100% buckwheat, I thought it would be a fairly reasonable choice, with many things I could still eat. Although the waiter seemed a bit unsure about the meaning of celiac, he listened to my explanation, and passed it on to the kitchen, who he said scrubbed down the cooking plates several times before making my galette (as they are also used for sweet crepes with wheat). The waiter was also very patient with me, even bringing a bottle of the buckwheat beer they had to the table so I could check if it was gluten free (it's not :(). They also let me have any of the sweet crêpe types with a buckwheat base! So, I felt they were very sensitive to my condition, and I felt relatively safe eating there.The galettes and sweet crêpes are also very tasty--maybe not *quite* on par with my favorite crêperie in Paris, but it will certainly do!"
4,Excellent gyros and other Greek specialities from very friendly people who know their food. Also a great take-away selection.
4,Loved the hipster vibe + the awesome coffee. Friendly staff and generally great atmosphere. Would have come back for more if only I had stayed longer in town!
3,"If you are looking for a nice little Italian restaurant in hamburg then you should go there. They serve a really good pizza and also the pasta is good. The atmosphere is quite nice if you don't look at all the Italian kitsch around you. It's very small, so be there on time or reserve a table."
2,"Bei derriesigen Auswahl an asiatischen Essensmöglichkeiten bietet dieser BOK imUnterscheid zu vielen anderen, auch derselben Kette, doch wirklich ein gutesNiveau. Essen und Preis stehen im korrekten Verhältnis, verstehe auch nichtdiesen Hype, dass in Deutschland immer alles so heiß gegessen werden muss.Gemüse ist frisch, Tofu hat Geschmack, und ich mag die Atmosphäre."
1,"It was not tasty.The menu on the card is nice, but the kumpir itself.. is small and less tasty. For this price you could find more tasty potatoes everywhere else.Compared with other Kumpir in Berlin or Istanbul, this is the worst.The salad and sauce was kind of interesting and it looked almost fresh. The shop itself looks clean."
2,"If you want a ridiculously over-the-top ice cream, then this could be the place for you. Banana-splits, spagetti-ice cream (it looks like spagetti), milkshakes, etc. they have quite a range. It isn't cheap though. EUR4 for a milkshake and EUR6 for an ice cream dessert. Mostly everything had too much goudi colour for my tastes though. I eventually decided on a vanilla milkshake, which while it was very good, was deceptively small. I finished it almost immediately."
4,Very good food with cheap price especially for Arab people because you can fond traditional Arabic food. You can get all you can eat option with 7.5 euros. They have also good tea.
4,"We fully enjoyed delicious, creamy pistachio ice cream in home made waffle. A ball of ice cream was surprisingly large, which makes this place very affordable. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. Last, but not least, a special feature for kids - there is a swing outside!"
3,Weekly menu with a handful of different dishes plus a selection of wines. The prices are fair and the food was good. You definitely have to reserve a table for dinner times. They also offer outdoor seating with extra heaters.
4,"YAY- After being to this bar countless times now already with friends or just on my own and constantly raving about how much i enjoy this place I finally decided today that along with my Latte Macchiato I'd ask the name of the bar as for the longest time now have been calling it Sofabar for obvious reasons. With a salon lounge filled with pre-loved sofas, some definitely from another era... this is undoubtedly Hamburgs most comfortable bar. This place is always at least half full even during the day and on some nights you may even have to wait to score a couch of your own, but with over twenty sofas to sink into and table service, this is an ideal place to come chillout, listen to some tunes, sit back and have drinks with friends. Not only is this a great bar with reasonably priced beers and drinks.... the coffee is worth coming for too! The great all rounder..."
2,"this place deserves a lot of praise for the styles of the arts.the historical attributes of the arts are very impressive. in case you are it is your first time, it would nice to get in company with peoplehow know the place well. this will help you to explore a lot. the only thing that could make the place better is having staffs who really know what to look for with arts. in all this is a good place to spend time with visitors."
3,"My friends constantly referred to this place as the best Turkish restaurant in Hamburg, so we finally went there on Saturday at 2 AM. I was not disappointed! I only tried the Doner Teller, which was of decent size, and good taste. It was a bit cold, but nothing too serious.The service was great, even though the restaurant was full at 2 AM! Will definitely come by next time I am around the area"
4,"What a great little bar. Easy going, great music, live music, poetry, nice staff. Now hidden behind the new road."
3,The cakes are a delight for the eyesI ve tried only a tiny one filled with nuts and chocolate and it reached my bliss pointI will definitely try other pastriesOn the -side:the neighborhood is not exactly engaging and I wouldnt necessarily want to seat because I dont think i fit in but definitely worth a visit for a take away cake
3,"Stopped off for brunch on Saturday. My wife and I showed up around noon and found only a few seats available. Reservations seem really popular for breakfast here; I would definitely call ahead! Brunch runs from 8AM - 2PM and focuses on the classics: meat, cheese, eggs, eggs with bacon bits, OJ, and salad. I think it was just the right amount of food and selection for 8 Euro.Drinks, coffee and alcohol are available at the front counter. Everything seems to be self serve and pay afterwards. It's a pretty chill atmosphere, maybe a bit loud though when all the rooms are full. I'll probably be heading back."
4,"The best location - combine the industrial-habour-romantic with a Caribbean island atmosphere and you got it... It is a unique location and a unique concept - you can't help getting happy, despite the food is pretty flat ( but take the burger with rocket and parmesan it's special but nice) and the crew seems like people getting the same pay as you would expect on a far Caribbean island.... But they serve massive cocktails that will make your mule kick. A must do in Hamburg at summer."
3,"Nice local Greek place with decent food and big serving sizes. The staff is very attentive and nice, although very loud in conversations. It's pretty dark inside, but there are also some tables outdoor. The menu is quite diverse and most of the food options are meat. Not five stars yet, but definitely recommendable."
4,Came in here not particularly hungry but after seeing the size of the portions ended up eating quite a bit! Meat was so tender and tasty and I especially liked the freshness of the salad and the bread was just lovely.
4,"This is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant! As we walked in we were already so glad to be there. The interior design is so pleasing - both calm and hip. It would be a great place to bring a big group to. Clean lines mostly white, accented with dark wood tables and yellow cushioned benches gave it an snappy touch. There are only about 10 main dishes on the menu which is in my opinion a good sign. Everything tastes fresh. My friend and I ordered two different things and shared. The veggies were crisp and the meat perfectly prepared - the beef was tender and the chicken and pork were crisply grilled. I thought the offer was cleverly assembled, offering a variety in just one dish. For example: the grilled combination of pork, shrimp and egg roll on vermiccelli. It is located about 10 min. walking distance from Central Station or directly at U-Lohmuehlenstrasse. The price per plate is around 6-8 Euros. I suggest trying the Vietnamese beer, Saigon, made from rice. It was really good - kind of like Sake. They offer cocktails as well and of course tea."
4,Fantastic and classy bar. Excellent whisky selection and not too crowded. Staff are very professional.
0,"Food was ok, but my husband spent a portion of the evening chained to the big white chair...Avoid."
4,Incredible restaurant! We had our wedding party here and the employees went above and beyond to help us make it special. Not to mention the food was incredibly delicious! I had the salted sea bass. Yum!!!!!! We will definitely return for more excellent food soon again.
3,This is a pretty decent place close to the Qype HQ. They offer various pasta and antipasti. I had pasta with spinach cream sauce and that was tasty! Order right at the counter when you walk into this place.
4,"Kartoffel Keller! I loved everything about this restaurant. At first glance, Kartoffel Keller looks like any other restaurant from the front. That is, until you realize that it's actually in the basement! Open the old door and be greeted with plenty of old world deco. They use waxy candles that melt over a wine bottle and by the look at the wax, they only use candle light. The ambiance is a bit dark but it's fitting. On to the food! I love potatoes. I love everything about potatoes and this restaurant specializes in potatoes! The translation of Kartoffel Keller is Potato Cellar. I went straight to the potato salads because I love German potatoes salads back home. There were types I have never seen nor heard of before so I went for the one that was that sounded the most unique. Potato salad with young herring, onions, beet root and apple slices. Everything in the salad was excellent. The sauce was a bit more watery then you'd find back home but it helped coat all the pieces nicely. The onions added a nice spicy bite. The potatoes were a little bitey which is exactly how I like them. I ordered the potato stew with sausage for the main course. It was very filling. It's served in a pot hanging over a tea light candle to keep it warm. The stew consistency was a little thin for what I would call stew, but the taste was there. There was some ground sausage in it with some cased sausage as well. Both were excellent. Since it was almost Christmas, I had to order the Gluhwein. It was very well done as well. The spices weren't over powering and it was just sweet enough to overcome the winey vapor you get from hot wine. Combine the ambiance with the food and the price, this place is a winner in my book. Next time I'm in Hamburg, you know where to find me. :)"
4,"pannfisch is essentially the hamburg's take on fish and chips and yes it's way better. i think they use three kinds of fried fishes. i have to admit that they taste a little funny like every time i have a fish dish in germany. it all tastes funny. lake fish. sea fish. so i guess it is its own taste, but i can grow into that. it comes with senfsauce which is a mustard sauce. good idea. packed with flavor as opposed to your usual tartar suace. and bratkartoffel always wins my heart. and don't forget to get your beer.this place is a one-man operation place. you go to the counter to order and to pay. they are not used to foreign tourists around here. i ordered in german, so i am not sure if they speak english. the bathroom is in the icecream shop next door, which also provides a seamless transition to dessert. 1 euro icecream = yes please. when your CEO works at yelp and he said he liked it, i have to believe it right?"
3,"After an aborted attempt to visit another restaurant on our first evening in Hamburg we found this delightful little pub. Tucked in a pretty, quieter part of Hamburg near the Hummel statue, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the servers (not all spoke English, but were more than happy to get their coworkers who did, and English menus were available) were friendly and even attentive - not terribly common in Germany! You don't have only one server - the whole team is ready to help you. We were excited to try a craft Pils rather than something from the big breweries, so we ordered a few glasses. After a few inquiries we made our selections from the menu. I wanted to try a dish more local to Hamburg and our server helpfully pointed them out to me - all different herring dishes. I asked which she would recommend and she very helpfully told me that the Eingelegte Bratheringe (a fried herring dish) had started marinating that day, so it wouldn't really taste the way it should until it had marinated overnight and therefore suggested the Heringstopf - a dish with marinated herring fillets in a housemade cream with onions and apples. It came with Bratkartoffeln (fried potatoes) and salad. It was delicious but extremely rich. I couldn't finish it because we had ordered an appetizer (a very tasty goose terrine). The boy had pork schnitzel which came with a nice cucumber and cream salad that we didn't have in any other parts of Germany. Bottom line: The meal was reasonably priced, the service was friendly and efficient, there were Hamburg specialties on the menu, the ambiance was great, the area was pretty and the beer selection was good. Wholeheartedly recommend it."
1,"Overrated Italian restaurant, expensive, laud and busy. My chair was in the middle of the corridor and every time the waiters were hitting on me. The risotto was quite a strange one, couldn't finished it. And the pasta of the day looked like the pasta of last week. Not al dente but overcooked, without personality and taste I was expecting in a family Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Not a place to come back."
4,"The best quality espresso bar in Hamburg. I used to live upstairs, so I was a regular. They have a very cute Instagram account, too! The layout is minimalistic and I love their blue espresso bar!"
4,"This is the equivalent of street food in Hamburg.  In the downtown area there are two right across the street from each other.  No place to sit, just stand and eat your sausages. I had the grilled krakauer sausage not the Curry Wurst.  They were awesome."
4,a great taste of home with american style breakfast complete with excellent veggie sausage. good pancakes too!
3,"Wow, talk about cheap and plentiful food. I came close to the end of lunch time when most of the food was sold out! I ordered the fish of the day. They were out of potatoes and asked if pasta was OK. I was given a HEAPING plate of fish and spaghetti (like the entire box).  The fish was covered in a delicious, savory yellow sauce (the color of hollandaise but tasted different - better). There is no English menu but the host and chef were very sweet and accommodating. There is limited seating inside but plenty of outside seating. Highly highly recommend! My second best meal in Hamburg."
4,"Good atmosphere, great breakfast.We took 1 large breakfast which was indeed large with mix of breads, yogurt, hard cheese, fruits and salad. In addition, we also took eggs and salad which was good but nothing out of the ordinary.Lovely opener for the day."
3,"A pleasent small caffe, ideal for quick coffee, tea and snack. Service is very much in portugese style, welcomy. Same as other portugese caffe in Lange Reihe, Caravela, they offer warm toasted sandwiches which is not easy to find in this town."
3,Excellent cheap Indian food as evidenced by how crazy busy they were this Wednesday night. Got the veggie thali and okra curry for 6euros each. Very busy around 7:15 on a weekday- ended up waiting more than 30 mins for our food. (Thus minus one star). Otherwise very flavorful and the mango lassi was perfect on a summer day.
4,"Tiny and cramped Indian restaurant with self service in the middle of Hamburg. The food is excellent at such a cheap price point, it's unbelievable. Definelty check it out if you love authentic Indian cuisine. Many vegetarian options available as well and their Mango Lassi is amazing."
2,"This has been on our list to try based on the reviews. Sadly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the sushi. My hubby and I ordered the echtasien Mix II, so we can try a variety of rolls. The platter comes with 2 maki, 2 special rolls, 4 nigiri, 6 sashimi and 2 shrimp tempura. It sounds like a lot but the rolls are rather small and we didn't leave dinner too full, i.e. I could've eaten more. There weren't many choices for the special rolls since they had to be under 9€ for the mix platter. The food came out fast, which was awesome. The quality of fish seemed good, but the rolls fell apart really easily.Our waiter was really nice, the restaurant itself felt warm and cozy even though it is quite big, and it's located in a nice area. It would be a nice place for a date night. The quality and pricing of food was not comparatively better than other sushi restaurants we've been to, though. Perhaps the non-sushi dishes are good, but I don't think I would come back here just for the sushi."
4,"What a nice little cafe! only 20 minutes walk from my house in Grindel, this cafe-bar-brunch-cake-snack place serves nice omelets and yummy Tazza d'Oro coffee. I was surprised at how friendly the service was here and the prices were well decent - a breakfast and two cups of coffee for 8eu is more than a fair deal. This cafe (and Karolinenviertel in general) reminds me of Berlin. I really don't come to the area as often as I should."
1,"Very nice location and the food is good (if they still serve it). Having said this, the service is just not able to keep up with the demand which shows the lack of concept: Only some service personal is allowed to take orders/payments whereas others only serve as ""food/drink carriers"". Thus, getting attention of one of the few ""higher ranked waiters"" to order or pay is just nearly impossible. Due to bad attention to the tables people stand in line right at the kitchen door to order or pay. This results in the other guests receiving even less attention. Furthermore, they stopped serving breakfast at 11am on a Sunday due to the kitchen not being able to keep up with the amount of orders. Final conclusion: Nice location but due to the incapable personal only recommended if you have a lot of time and a high level of frustration tolerance."
4,"Probably the best vegetarian restaurant in Hamburg! Went there on recommendation by a local and was not disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious and the menu offers a big variety of creative dishes and drinks. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere nice and cosy. Highly recommendable, even for those who are usually meat eaters. If you're coming with a bigger group or around weekend, making a reservation would be advisable as it's highly frequented."
4,"I just like this place the beer is always cold, the music (Indie/Alternative) is always brilliant, the people around are always friendly & easy-going and the barstaff are always genuine folks. The bar itself is retro-style (orange / brown) decorated with some glamorous wallpaper :)They also got a couple of smaller rooms next to the main one equipped with loads of comfy cairs, sofas and stools. All rooms are dimly lit and so make you feel at home easily. Yet it's a smoker-friendly bar which is a disadvantage for me personally but what the heck :) As a plus you could get the chance to bump into the odd rockstar coming from Knust or Schanze. Mutter is said to be one of their fave hangouts after the show."
4,"I loved this place! The staff is very friendly and fast! However, in case you don't like waiting for others to finish eating, I suggest you to book a table in advance :)"
3,"This restaurant was a short walk from our hotel, so we stopped in for dinner.  The place was crowded, but we were seated upstairs right away.  We were also very happy that both the hostess and waiter spoke English exceedingly well.I got the schweinshaxe (roast pork knuckle) and my friend got a fish dish.  The potato dumpling served with the pork was probably the best I'd had in Germany, but the pork at the Schneider (Weisses) Brauhaus was much better.Prices were reasonable, the establishment is roomy, and we sat at a table for two (which is rare in some places).  Overall, a good dining experience."
0,"Barca is a shame for the leisure and tourism industry in Hamburg!On a sunny day in September we decided to take a pedalo boat trip in the evening and called Barca. Unfortunately they only have one mobile phone and no one picks up the phone. I tried it several times during 3 hours and I wrote an email. We needed to go to Barca without any information as the website does not provide a lot of general info on the pedalos. This left us unsatisfied at the counter at 7 p.m., because a boat rental was not possible anymore. They told us it is to late as sunset is in an hour and they frankly speaking do never pick up the phone. The pedalos looked nice and the landing stage was packed with people chatting and enjoying the fresh breeze.In the end this is the worst customer service I have expected in years. No one ever picked up the phone, nobody responded to my mail so far and the website does not provide basic information on the rental times."
4,This is our regular as well as special Sushi place in Hamburg. Always an-above-average quality and never tiring variety of sushi :)
0,"DON'T GO TO SCHWEINSKE, DON'T GO TO ANY OF SCHWEINSKE'S RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!WHY?It's not that I've experienced bad service or had a fight with some waiter, it's just bad because the food is horrible.Why would someone pay 20 times more then you could buy the same food in supermarkets and heat it up in the microwave? Well that's is actually what Schwinske does.NOTHING IS FRESH. N O T H I N G.And I think someone who ownes such a chain and serve such bad food for that price, that person must be evil haha. I'm serious.IT'S A RIP OFF.I saw many times how they prepare the food. They just take it out form cans and/or defrost something.And the breakfast offer is just  H O R R I B L E. Haha Do yourself a favor, be a little classy and spend a little more time, but the same money for some better restaurants to eat. Heeeyyyy that's why we have YELP :D"
3,Greek food for the soul ;)im not Greek but i really liked the food and appetizer here.the owner is supper friendly and gave us very good tips on selecting different dishes. :)
3,"Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot.Whenever we meet you're usually grumpy. People say you're lovely but to me, you're just grumpy.This crisp Winter morning though you smile. You manage to brighten up my day. And for the first time I can see why people speak so fondly of you.A narrow city beach. Blue skies. Large container ships passing by and merging with the dockyards' silhouettes for a moment. A beach bar, a hot drink. People chilling, sunbathing, walking their dogs. Or kids.Hamburg, you showed me your pretty side. I can stay here for a while."
4,"The food was outstanding as was the setting and ambiance. However, sadly one member of staff was very rude - we had asked what the people next to us were having and then went onto order two separate dishes. We were then given three dishes and when we said we did not order the waffle, we just  asked what it was she was extremely rude - this continued when we paid the bill. This was a tad disappointing after a fabulous brunch."
1,"I used to love this place! Unfortunately the guy at the front desk has changed and I find him very unfriendly. I have had multiple disappointing exchanges with him in the few times I have been back this year already. The food has also taken a turn for the worse. Once when an item on the menu said cashews or raisins, it actually came with them. Now you are lucky if you get more than two of each. The vegetable portion of the meals now consists mainly of just onions (loads of them) and peppers. What happened to the healthy portion of broccoli, bamboo, coriander? Come on guys! Where is the love?! The restaurant needs real glasses, not plastic cups for our drinks. Lastly, the use of salt in all meals is excessive. I was a long time fan of bok but recently have only had disappointments there. I won't be returning any time soon unfortunately."
4,A lovely little wine bar with a tranquil ambience. Nice selection of wines even though the menu is only in German. Lovely appetizer available to accompany the wide selection of wines. The service is nothing great but nothing to really complain about. This place also doubles up as a Wine shop. Recommended for Dates or couples evenings.
4,"We ordered Nouko Ramen, Gyoza, fried chicken, they all taste good, but I can't really tell whether it's because the food or because I'm too hungry, we waited 40min to get the table.Anyway, I will come again. Now, time for ice cream \o/"
4,"This was a truly fantastic meal, possibly the best we have had on our trip in Germany.I got the filets of 3 fish in dijon sauce, and my partner ordered the schnitzel.  The fish was out of this world, some of the best I have ever had, and the sides it came with were amazing as well.  To drink I had the peppermint and ginger tea which they make themselves, and the waitress/owner offered refills of hot water for the tea, and brought tap water to drink (a rare pleasure for Canadians who are used to always having free tap water at restaurants).  The tea was really an unexpected bonus to the meal, as I was expecting dried tea, instead of fresh leaves and ginger.  Even the sugar to add to the tea was crystal rock sugar instead of plain ground white sugar.I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the fish or the local fare, however you should make a reservation or be prepared to sit outside / wait, as it is very popular!"
3,"Despite being really close to the office, I hadn't yet been to Brook - maybe because it is a little bit more expensive than our usual quick lunch places! However, I thoroughly recommend it as lunchtime business venue or evening romantic spot. Situated on the busy Bei den Muhren, overlooking the water, we were able to watch the usual Hamburg weather (bright sunshine then aggressive winds and then torrential rain) rush past in the space of a relaxing 1.5 hours The restaurant itself is large and spacious with an open and modern design. Window tables such as we had I think will be much more pleasant than the inner tables. The 3 course daily lunch menu was excellent and very decent value for this quality of food: A lovely and delicate / frothy asparagus soup, tuna steak on a tomato risotto and a delicate fruit tart with ice-cream. Only minor quibble would be the speed of service - fine for a leisurely evening meal, but perhaps a little slow for a lunchtime off the set menu. But overall a really good discovery. I will be back."
3,If you order the Bio-Wuchtbrumme mit Grillgold you will receive a piece of organic meat soaked in a reddish curry dip served with french fries. - Go for it!
1,"The food was amazing. And it's such a cosy venue.The service, however, was pretty bad. Our waitress tried very hard, and was very friendly. But:- Apparently the person showing guests the tables was new, and she sent everyone to tables serviced by the same waitress.- As a result, every time we wanted to order drinks or food, it took ages to order, and even longer to arrive.- After waiting an hour for our food, it turned out the kitchen lost our order (and of the table next to us), and we had to wait ages again for our food. Not sure the good food outweighted the huge wait."
3,"Had a good lunch at ROK during their quiet opening. The procedure is to take a pager at the front, order and scan in the back, they page you, and then you pay with the pager. A little complicated, to say the least. Had the special pizza of the day, which was pretty tasty (see photo caption). Prices were a little higher than normal, but the atmosphere is nice, and food is good. Will be back."
3,"The Kornhauskeller is a nice, small restaurant with very friendly staff. The lunch menu is rather small, and they offer some German and some Syrian dishes. I had Falafel for lunch, which was truly delicious and cost me only 6,40EUR."
4,"It's like have your personal chef. If you are in Hamburg this is the place. Excellent service, excellent food!"
4,"I've now breakfasted twice at Moraba, and have both times stayed after I finished to study. The best part of this place is their fresh juices  incredible. The breakfasts are also simple, but tasty. As for the local, it is very cozy, has functional Internet, and the service is always very friendly and attentive. Prices are also good for student life. I'm always very pleased when I come, and will continue to go there."
1,"This place has mediocre food at best. Been here twice now, hoping the second time it would be better. Oh well, not the case. Service is slow and fairly uninterested. Had to more often than once get up to get the attention of the waitress. Further, I find the ambiance to be pretty boring and not even that authentic. Finally, the food is average at best. I really couldn't say I found it tasty at all. It wasn't bad I guess but I simply expect a lot more from Greek food. It's not that hard to get right, especially the grill plates. They used poor quality meat as well which was really disappointing. Won't be coming back here again."
0,"Walked in without a reservation expecting to have to wait a long time and instead got a death stare and a NO!  Hey, how about so sorry but please come back when you  have a reservation, but no we got the dirtiest look. How dare we try to eat there!"
1,"If you speak English or not that much German and have any needs that you want to communicate, this might not be the place. The staff did not understand what we asked for when saying ""keine Milch"", which should be pretty self explanatory.. They also forgot to give us our drinks. Food (when we finally managed to make an order) was good, though."
4,"Amazing Italian food.  If you go, you must try the fresh tagliatelle mixed in a Parmesan wheel with white truffles.  Absolutely divine!Make reservations and go early...as they run out of dishes (especially fish dishes) around 8-9PM.Honestly, you have to love a restaurant that buys their main ingredients fresh every morning and sells out at some point in the night.   You know you are getting the best possible ingredients you can get.You must try at least once!"
4,"What a lovely place. Feels like ""Little Italy"" in Hamburg.Coffee, sandwiches, baguetts and other small things makes the time there timeless.Fantastic place to relax, enjoy and chill Clear recommendation!!"
4,"And so I did check it out! Pauli Pizza is definitely my new fave take-out pizza place! The menu is only DIY, and I was very overwhelmed by the choice. Fortunately the creative pizza genius of Lea was on hand to produce a pizza to savour. Two eggs? Yes please! Highly recommended for pizza, beer and chat."
2,"I was recommended Gazi Antep by friends, but I can't say that I was impressed. Far from it in fact, it seemed like a pretty standard kebab shop with nothing to make it stand out as particularly good. I can't totally remember what I had, but I think it was some kind of doner plate."
3,This place is a lot smaller than expected but the food was so tasty. I recently converted to vegetarianism and needed to find a place that catered to such. I was craving Mexican food and this was the first place that popped up on my search. This is not a fast food place so don't expect to get your order within 5 minutes of ordering. There weren't any free tables so my bf and I sat at the bar sipping on our Fritz-Kolas as we waited ~25min for our food.I ordered the spinach quesadilla with 3 sides of salsa dip. It was so goodddd!!! I think it's enough to hold you over until dinner time.
4,I came here as a guest at a group party with a fixed menu. So I can comment on the regular menu. We were a party of 30. The service and food were excellent. As an american I have a discriminating taste for good beef. Frankly my opinion of burgers and steaks here on the continent hasn't been good. I rarely order them because I have been disappointed so many times. But I had a wonderful steak here. Char grilled and obviously a very nice piece of beef to begin with. Juicy and properly cooked medium rare. The sides served family style were hot and a nice variety. The assorted desert plate was a nice surprise as well. Prompt service with plenty of attentive staff.
2,"This restaurant exists since forever. The first time I came here I was still a kid. Since back then nothing has changed.The food is still the same, the seats and tables are the same. It's auhtentic chinese food and Dim Sum.I don't give it 4 stars, because yelp tells me ""I'm a fan."" which I'm not. I don't think any normal person would be a fan of a restaurant.I don't give it 5 stars, because it isn't as good as it gets.BUT I still highly recommend this place. It's good ;) And a lot of chinese eat here. The prove of quality."
3,"This place is a standout for us and almost comfort food when we are in town.  This location is near the University and has diverse clientele. The bathrooms are clean and most of the staff speak English to some degree. Additionally, there are two possibilities for ordering: the normal sit down meal with cloth napkins on one side or the takeout/less posh tables on the side with the corner door.  We usually opt for the latter option unless it is a special occasion as it is 15-25% cheaper. Great place for a date or an informal business dinner. WELL behaved puppies are welcome as long as they sit under the table. The food is great and they have a Pakistani twist on some of you favorite ""Indian"" dishes."
4,"Best little falafel place on the 'schanze. Friendly staff, great value, and most importantly really tasty authentic falafel. Their Kimo Falafel is my own tip. Can get crowded in the smallish seating area but never feels uncomfortable."
2,"Was waiting for my bus from Hamburg to Berlin and had some time to kill so I wanted a sit down to eat place instead of a form of takeout, I walked around the haubenhauf and found a string of restaurants and after looking at all the posted menus I decided I'd check out Nagel which is a German pub/restaurant, there is plenty of outdoor seating but I opted to sit inside which had plenty of tables and a good ambiance, they had a few different beers and liquors on the menu but I wasn't actually in the mood to have a drink so I opted for a water, for food I have their house salad which was good and had a dressing already on there, I ordered a schnitzel yet again which came with sliced roasted potatoes almost like potato du jour, the schnitzel I ordered came with horseradish sauce I decided to give it a shot and have a dish I really like prepped a little differently, it wasn't bad but I definitely prefer it with the sweeter sauce, overall this is a decent spot that's close to both hamburg's central station and also close to the bus station as well, I think I'd try another spot before trying this one again, not because it was bad but just because it wasn't too memorable to be honest"
4,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, definitely one of my favourite bars in Hamburg. The sofas look as if time traveled from last century, and you'd probably not want to look at them during daylight, but they're so comfy and worn down, they practically engulf you when sitting on them. Drinks here are decent, but not great, but you'd probably come here for the atmosphere and the people anyways."
4,"twice I have eaten here and I have to add, the best Falafel I have eaten. The staff is really friendly, which is a plus when the place is full. I totally recommend it!"
4,"Went here for breakfast and literally cannot fault the place. Sat outside on the cushioned windowsill in lovely nostalgic autumnal sunlight and drank coffees and heard fog horns from the river. We then sat inside for our food - sharing the one table in the place with a couple of other people. Beautiful platter of meat and cheese and perfectly cooked boiled eggs. Wonderful milchkaffee and the friendliest people run the place. Very relaxed, brilliant. Deserves some points for x-factor."
3,Trendy & HotYoung & creative crowdDelicious & cheapGut & Günstig Perfect for friends gathering and burger sharing. Healthy salads for ladies are adding a good asset of choice
4,"If you can make ice cream out of it, you'll find it here. They sell ice cream flavours I would never have dreamt of, and I have to say this is quite probably THE best ice cream shop in Hamburg - if not Europe. The size of the queues all year round will prove me right. Delicious!"
4,"Very good meat, very good pieced together burgers in general. Very comparable to an american chain called BurgerFI. I'll be back on my next visit, thank you."
0,Location is great! On the beach with a stunning view of the harbor!Food and service is ok. But they only accept cash!!! In this day and age not acceptable.
4,"It is delicious,,,not so expensive and absolutely clean...Best Asia Imbiss in Hamburg..."
4,Really cosy place where you can enjoy a good coffee or hot chocolate in a very friendly atmosphere. :)
4,"Amazing mostly-vegetarian food, in a elegant yet comfortable setting.  Basically, my ideal dinner party.I had the risotto with Provence herbs and veggies (zucchini was the most memorable); creamy and cheesy, but still firm and not overcooked.  Feels like they might have a copy of the Moosewood cookbook, or something similar.I picked up the peanut and pepper soup and bread as a side --- again, immediately reminded me of the Moosewood.  The soup was savory, and the bread was fluffy but still hearty.The owner wasn't impressed by my first guess at a wine, and steered me towards a grechetto which better matched the risotto; I'm fine taking advice from someone who knows wine better, but there was definitely some steering.For dessert, I got the crème catalan --- a cinnamon version of a crème brûlée.  Tasty, but a bit puddinglike for my taste, and I would have been happy with half a serving.Many of the other reviews describe it as a vegetarian restaurant, but it does serve a few meat specialties like jamón serrano.Piccolo Paradiso serves the food I cook for myself --- and they do it better than I do."
4,"This place is amazing! Such great food! Decent price and great service, what more could you ask for?I came in on a slow night and the waiter gave me a free shot on the house. Not to mention the food was out of this world!"
2,"""Otto's'"" seem to be the only place in Hamburg currently serving ""Beyond Meat"" (The Impossible Burger, a competitor, isn't being served anywhere), vegetarian patties supposedly closely resembling meat texture and flavor.This is why I came here.Didn't enjoy Otto's ambiance too much: flickering neon lights, cold tiles, carefully run-down walls, bathrooms in a dark cellar ... all horror flick style. Most seats are hard and don't have backrests. Not cheap either (although, Germany take note, water ... is free and proactively offered.)- Drum roll -  my verdict on the Beyond Meat burger.The pessimist's take:This is, clearly, not beef. Too soft, and I can tell that this is not meat. If Beyond Meat is at version 1, wait for version 5.Mind you, I knew I was not having meat.So the optimist's take:I think that 95% of people would *not* have complained had they thought they'd be served a super-tender special-seasoning beef burger. Given that the burger's sauces and other flavors overlay much else, it would work. And it was not bad, better than any vegetarian burger I ever had.I am a carnivore, but hope that one day food like this can replace much of the cruelty of today's food chain. What a sad irony that this plant burger alternative currently costs 50% more than conventional beef.(Note: the 3*** rating isn't for this rather peculiar burger, but for place, ambiance, and its price-experience ratio in general.)"
4,It's exactly what I needed. Pancakes with a lot of syrup. It was everything I could have wished for this morning.
3,I came in on first opening day. Staff is very friendly and food was very good. This restaurant is now on my regular weekly lunch break list. I give one star less because kitchen is rather slow but I give this to quite busy conditions in first days when we were waiting 10-15 minutes just for seats. Will see how things will look after few months. Hope the spirit will stay and food quality will not drop.
4,"I great place to chill out in Niendorf. Whether you need to walk your dog, run, cycle or just sit on a bench this place is perfect. Lots of shaded paths make it nice and cool in summer. There's a playground for kids, barbeque areas and even a deer sanctuary. Waldcafe Corell is a really good place to stop off and get a snack too.I'm lucky enough to live 5 mins walk away from this place and I'm going to make sure I take advantage of it more in the future."
2,"De vraies crepes, incroyable!++* Food: the only reason you want to go there is to eat those dark buckwheat flour 'galettes', which are much healthier and filling than than their crepes counterparts (served for dessert). The latter can be found in any street corner/mall, etc...The chocolate flambee one is a show by itself!* Atmosphere: you want to go there with a bunch of friends to enjoy a bottle of cider. Decoration is refreshing ! The ""Bretagne"" feeling is definitely there. Waiters wear those marine stripped shirts, Jean Paul Gaultier? I don't think so, they have a connected shop within the restaurant where you can buy those shirts. Sweet anyway...* Location: Deichstrasse is one of the few streets Hamburg which doesn't make my eyes bleed. There are other restaurants I'll visit soon or later.Staff: quite friendly & many French, good signs? Locals tend to think so ;)--The place probably lives on its glory time, now that it is quite famous in town it can afford to be less flexible. Case in point: I had an egg galette which came literally with 1 egg on top (really people !?) but then it ""only"" costs 4,1eur. The chicken one is prepared in mustard instead of having the chicken prepared and get the mustard extra/aside... I only see a trick here to keep unsold meat for an extra day in the fridge ( pretty wrong in my opinion)The only place in town for a true galette so go for the refreshing experience!However when everything comes in sugar, cheese or covered in questionable dressing and there is almost no room to adjust the toppings, I doubt that I'll be a regularThey need a serious competitor to wake them up, anyone ?"
1,"Maybe it was because I was set on having an authentic California burrito experience that I was left so unsatisfied. I ordered the chicken burrito and knew what to expect in terms of presentation based on all the pictures on Yelp--wrapped in paper instead of foil and grilled. That's different, but no biggie. I was, for some reason, expecting to pick up the burrito and eat it like normal with my hands, but alas it was too overstuffed and soggy to do so. The mixture of the lettuce, rice, beans, and salsa tasted good, but the chicken lacked flavor. My hubby ordered the enchilada, which was a burrito smothered in mole sauce. The mole sauce was way too chocolatey, like milk chocolate was used in the sauce chocolatey.Yes, I know we live in Hamburg now and I shouldn't expect the same flavorful, meat and rice cooked in lard wrapped neatly in a heavenly package of greasy goodness...The place was quite crowded when we arrived but we were able to grab a booth in the corner. There is high turn over here, so you may only need to wait a little bit  for a free table. I did enjoy the luchadora theme decor. I don't think I'd come back any time soon, but if a hankering for a burrito or Mexican food  manages to overpower me, I'd give Jim Burrito another try."
4,"Had some excellent Königsberger Klöpse (meatballs) here at lunchtime with great mash potato and sauce. EUR5,90 for a small portion which was very filling. Quick, hot and very impressive. It gets pretty full in here at lunchtime so you may have to share a table."
1,"Had dinner here with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. Tasted good, but messed up our plumbing. Won't be coming here anymore! Unless you're ok with a tummy ache after. Good luck!"
0,"Terrible service for less than mediocre sushi. For that kind of food, it's better to do a take out from an Imbiss."
2,"Es ist ok, overall. I'm from California and have consumed countless burritos in the States...from the States that really matter when it comes to Mexican cuisine. (I've also been to Mexico a few times.)How does the food here compare? It's not too bad...really. The flavors were ok...maybe just lacking that delicious and dirty pig-fat flavoring from the grill. I enjoyed the burrito much more than the ""enchilada"" as the burrito was prepared much more like how they should be.Service was very friendly and the decor and atmosphere actually felt very SoCal-ish...think La Lucha Libre in SD, but less pink and gaudy and more punk."
4,"We stumbled upon this place after doing a free walking tour, and I'm so glad we did! Everyone was so nice, and were really willing to help us out by explaining things in English. and the food was so delicious! I had a sandwich and my wife had the risotto with a salad. We both absolutely loved it. Great place for a great lunch!"
3,"If you want yummy pierogis, vodka and a great location in north St. Pauli, this is the place to go."
3,"I've now been here three times and can say I think the food is stupidly good for the price (~6€ per meal). I've ordered the palak paneer thali the last two times and would highly recommend this dish (spinach with cheese cubes).This is a pretty small place with authentic Indian food served on metal trays. You order at the counter, get a buzzer, then pickup your food, which is divided into entree, rice, yogurt, side salad, side chickpeas, and naan. Everything is really fresh tasting and delicious, besides the small salad which is really boring (but whatever, ignore it). I could easily recommend this place if you want some authentic Indian food."
4,"Really nice Café: I love to sit outside, drinking excellent Cappuccino or Latte! Far to much of good cakes for me...One of my favorite Cafés in Hamburg !"
3,"Yum! Quick, easy, and filling. I got the first lamb dish on the menu and it was great. They don't have enough seating for their demand, so people come and wait around looking for seats all the time. It's a little bit fast-food like, actually. But the food is simple and tasty. Comes with naan and rice and yogurt (+ salad and a soup kinda thing) for a great price."
1,"We had the Lachs Waffel with the beetroot dip. It sounded good on the menu, but when it was served it was actually just a big waffel with a few pieces of smoked Lachs lying on top of it. Also the taste of the waffel was odd and the whole thing just didn't taste good. In addition, 6-7 euros is quite pricey for this type of dish. Overall the food was pretty disappointing, so I wouldn't recommend going there."
3,"The food here was pretty good, the service was decent, and the building itself was pretty cool to look at. The salmon was pretty good. It wasn't amazing, but it was one of the better ones I've had in Hamburg. The meatball was tender and juicy. Very good. The side salads were also very good, as was the sweet mustard that came with both the salmon and the meatball. The starter we got (a traditional German dish of ground of herring - I can't remember the name) I didn't find particularly good, but the person I was with enjoyed it."
3,"I ate here a few nights ago (on a Saturday) we were lucky to be able to reserve a table - booking is highly recommended. We visited for the traditional Bavarian experience, we weren't disappointed. Drinking litre beers from steins and feeding on schnitzels (huge) the evening ended watching the traditional Bavarian band and sinking a few shots of Jagermeister. Great way of experiencing the Munich beer houses in Hamburg."
3,"Good after works, happy hours & some random students. Quite a nice location in city center, venue itself is trying to be cool and modern. Food is not my highest choice, but drinks are definitely 8out of 10! So for Thursday evening after work drink - big yes!"
3,"I'm shoooory? That's what the waitress kept saying when my friend and I asked her questions about the items on the menu. She's super cute and my friend was totally hitting on her. We were in search of some pho to kick start our day after a night of drinking. It's the perfect cure for a hangover (see previous reviews of my Eurotrip). After a short amount of deliberations, Yelp brought us to Quán dò. The restaurant is conveniently located around the corner from the HBF and easy to find. We didn't spend much time studying the menu because it was in German. However, there was Vietnamese writing (no English?) next to the German item. It's not hard to find ""Bò tái - Rindfleisch ,medium'"" on the menu, especially seeing it on hundreds of other menus. I also ordered the Lychee lemonade to wash it down. Water is not free in Germany. You'll have to fork over some euros for stillwater. I was absolutely amazed to see water in glass bottles. They're pretty rare in America.The Bò tái was served Northern style for sure. The broth was very savory and the soup came with a Chinese fried dough. That's how they do it in Vietnam and it was great eating something authentic in a foreign place. If you are used to a plate of bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil, you are in the wrong place. That's Southern style.  Hamburg is certainly diverse enough to have a large population of Asians. Still we were missing some critical items to make our broth perfect. We asked for some red chilies because it lacked the spice we needed. The waitress gave us a bowl of chopped red chilies. The lychee lemonade was very refreshing.The price was under €10 and very affordable. I would definitely come back again."
3,"Just went to Kardelen with a bunch of people from the office. I was told that no-one had reviewed it because no-one could ever remember it's name. Well it wasn't even listed in Qype! As it happens I also forgot the name, but clever me took a photo ;) Anyway I had a chicken doner plate (it came with rice and salad and sauce). It cost EUR5.50 and also came with free bread and tea! It was pretty huge (see photos) but I was pretty hungry and so polished it off... I'd definitely go back again."
2,"Cute small coffee shop in EimsbuettelThe Speisekammer is a cute place to enjoy breakfast in the morning or a slice of cake in the afternoon.During nice weather you can watch pedestrians from their small patio or if it is too cold or rainy relax behind their large window front or upstairs where they also have a small kids corner.The cake is fantastic, the service a little slow. However, if you are not in a rush it is a good coffee shop to spend some time.+ delicious cake+ good coffee - slow service (bring some time and patience)Credit cards accepted."
3,"Three things here are unquestionably cool. The name: A day bar, which is called ""first love"", cannot be completely bad. Then the free view through the enormous windowpanes. And (last but not least) the WLAN (uncool: it's npt free). What else? The usual menu card with pasta & snacks as well as the obligatory selection on coffee from latte to espresso and various cakes (home-made?). A popular meeting place also in the summer, where one can sit outside at beer garden tables. Also a good after worx hangout. The beautiful large heavy sturdy wood tables are used often also for project meetings. Meals, drinks, work, chat, hanging out in an area with bar. It's nice to be here."
4,"Brilliant chinese restaurant and easily the best I've been to in Hamburg. Golden seem to concentrate more on traditional Chinese dishes instead of the carbon-copy stuff we're all used to seeing on the menu in other Chinese establishments. So, what's on the menu? Well, what isn't? Asparagus in chopped scampi, cold glass-noodle salad, green onion soup, various rice, noodle, beef, fish and chicken dishes, Golden really has it all, and most of it will be very new to you - so try it out! Very highly recommended!"
3,"The one time I have been here, I ordered the chicken schnitzel with Spätzle and it was very delicious! I had one of their alsterwassers but this time decided to try out the dark version of it and it was even more yummy than the regular one. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
3,"The Stadtpark is a great place to relax and lie in the sun, have a walk, go running or make barbecue. There is a special area for the barbecue with containers for the charcoal. Highlights of the Stadtpark are the Planetarium and the pool."
1,"I'm mean really guys- 4 beers two burgers and some Nachos = €75 or something - really...?Burger were OK - Buns were a disgrace , Nachos - Good!- Staff had to be reminded three times of the empty beer glasses and a new order  !-but they were friendly!I'm travelling world wide - always end up in some hard rock cafe, since all the folks find it sooo cool - LAME!Hey, they played German Electro beats at the Hardrock cafe Hamburg - That has NOTHING to do with Hard Rock - play Rock - or actually Hard Rock, hence the name-Only tourists - not one person from HH in there.Just a big corporation trying to sell some shirts for € 20-40 a pop- Nothing to see here , move on!"
3,"Very good brunch with homemade marmalade, pesto and tiny pieces of delicious cheesecake! The staff is very friendly. I went there on a Sunday so it was very crowded in the small Coffee shop.I like to go there again."
3,"A great place for a get-together.  The atmosphere is inviting, buzzing;  the lighting, the sparking glassware here, the stacked bottles there,  the open table seating with little nooks here and there - - it is a great place to be.  The drawback being, that it gets loud.The food is on one page at the back of a massive drinks menu, but the quality shines.   The salads were big and beautiful,  and the flammkuchen with crème fraîche, spring onions, speck, and pfifferlinge was perfect - - beautiful balance of ingredients, satisfying creamy base, and just delicious.The wines were OK.  The recommended red from our stellar server opened up nicely over time.  My two whites had character, but were nothing I'd buy in.    The staff were knock-out attentive, gracious, and capable.   The were super busy, but always responsive."
3,"Great burger, but with slightly too many customisation questions from the waitress.Historically this venue has had problems with slow food service, but after visiting on a Thursday lunchtime they seem to have worked these issues out."
4,The best six euros you'll spend on Indian food! The mango lassi is delicious and I highly recommend the matter paneer and the butter chicken. Not great for big groups though.
4,"I was lucky to get to visit the Exhibition 'Mahjong;' in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. This was an extensive exhibition that was curated with the highest calibre. The exhaustative exhibition told truths about China from approximately 1979 to 2005 through the work of many chinese artists. On entering this exhibition the first piece reduced me to tears and of course frightened my pal who ran off to hide in the toilets. The piece featured a giant sized wallet that framed video footage of the production of wallets in sweatshops, slaughter houses and high street designer stores. The video footage was also complimented by very sad violin music. The rest of the exhibition was a weeks worth of viewing, and expressive pieces that told us truths about China. We were educated with hard hitting expressive modern peices. The final pieces I viewed were some Mao propoganda graphics. I think this exhibition at the Hamburger Kunsthalle was one of the most outstanding of exhibitions I ever visited and i would of course always be interested to know what goes on in the Kunsthalle."
4,"Great little cafe in the middle of a passage shopping area. They have awesome coffee, as well as ice cream cones. The area is great to sit and watch people going by, and at times in the afternoon there is even live music playing in the shopping area. It is nicely done, and reasonably priced."
3,The food at this place is great and creative! I guess one of the most fun kitchens and quality on the Lange Reihe... With regards to service they can definitely improve and I leave it at that... The restaurant is simply worth a visit!!!
4,"I should have come sooner, this place is everything I want in a coffeeshop! When I stopped off on a Saturday morning, I got a perfect V60 pour over coffee and some delicious eggs on toast. The atmosphere is warm and inviting inside, plenty of wood, with a nice view of the Hamburg canals. There is a large upstairs area with plenty of seating, if you want to stay for awhile.While they offer several different ways to make your coffee, don't be overwhelmed and talk with the staff about what you like, they are really friendly. They have a variety of beans, so you can definitely try a few combos and taste many different things. They do their roasting and sell their beans too, if you want to take things home. I can tell, I will be coming back here regulary!"
4,My friend told me that this is his favourite steak house in Hamburg. And he will come to the restaurant every time when he is in Hamburg. I order the lamb and it is really good. It taste very juicy and tender.
4,"No printed menu that I ever saw. A blackboard that looks to be updated daily on the wall. I took the waiters recommendation for what to have. Antipasti to share, secondi of pasta with truffles and entree of fresh grilled sea bass that he promised he would bone out. Really good. Never would have ordered that without his recommendation. My dining companion had homemade ravioli topped with white truffles. He was very happy. Good service that moved along but didn't feel rushed. Very reasonable prices for what we had. Under 100€ for two with three courses and drinks. This is a very small but popular dining place. It might be hard to sit and talk and just drink.  But there are other choices near by for that. Just dine here first!"
2,"I enjoyed a lunch here with some coworkers. The environment is really nice, it looks like a typical German restaurant. The location is really good, basically in the city center, you can easily reach it from the U-Bahn. The quality of food was good, I took a ""Jägerschnitzel"". Unfortunately, the service was a bit low. They took more than 30 mins to deliver the dishes..."
4,"Great food , don't mind the waiters they might be pushy but at the end they are dealing with a language barrier, other than that even the price was great"
3,"Crispy duck was good, bulgogi as well which comes with kimchi. The soups are ok, good do with an extra prawn and less grease. The price was excellent and service was good"
3,"The Parlament is located underneath the Rathaus. It is very beautiful with a nice mix of new and old. The menu offers German specialties: fish and meat. Our waitress was nice, but the drinks took long to be served. Enjoy"
2,"Right across from the Hauptbahnhof stands Nagel, one of the many German restaurants ín the city centre trying to attract tourists. It is nicely decorated, roomy and clean with interesting art-work on the walls. The menu choice is respectable as is the choice of drinks and the prices.My only complaint with this place is that I didn't find it very family friendly. It was made plain clear that my pram was in the way and it was even suggested to me that I should just leave it on the street - despite the fact it had a sleeping baby inside.This is still however a firm favourite for family and friends visiting from the UK"
0,The Dim sum was ok but the main dish Sweet and Sour was terrible . Cheap low quality chicken. The sauce was not made with love either and for 11.90 a real joke
3,"This is a great date location with its hip atmosphere and attractive (and competent!) servers.  The food is aesthetically pleasing, varied and of a good quality.  If you have a larger group though, the volume due to its high ceilings can be a bit overwhelming and the price is quite high though understandable for its location.  All in all, a great place to eat when you're in the area!"
4,"best currywurst i ever had. Came here last weekend for a quick snack before seeing There Will Be Blood, and left 10 minutes later completely sated. Obviously I had currywurst and fries. I also had an ""African"" cider, which was quite nice too. The guys running the place were really friendly, if a bit camera shy (I asked for a photo)."
3,"Good burger, nice restaurant, self-service, price low"
2,Basically currywurst in a different shape while sat at a table. the deserts were great though.
3,"When in Hamburg, you eat a hamburger, right?We'd had a long and exciting morning, traveling from Lubeck all the way to the airport and back into town, and needed lunch as soon as we got into town.  We walked out of the metro station, saw this place, and agreed that it made sense.  The place was packed, even at 2pm on a Friday.  Our group of 3 sent 2 to get food while the third held space for us to sit when we got our food - yes, it was that busy. The menu was all in German but with pictures to make it easy to understand.  I got the burger with the extra tomato relish and arugula, along with fries.  Most meals come with the combo, and I chose the sparkling water.   You order at the counter and then wait for your food to come up.  They're cooking it fresh, so it did take a few minutes to get the food.  The burger was cooked well, but was still juicy.  The bun was a little weak, but since everyone in the room was eating with knife and fork, they didn't mind that it was falling apart.  I also liked the crisp fries, even without ketchup, which I didn't get since it cost extra.  Portion was large - good deal for a lunch in Europe."
3,"Reizendes Restaurant mit hervorragender Küche mit österreichisch-französischem Einschlag. Für ein intimes Date sind die Tische allerdings zu nah beieinander stehend, und außerdem trifft man (leider..) jedesmal auf Bekannte dort, was den lauschigen Abend ebenfalls erschweren könnte"
4,"Due to the very good yelp reviews, we decided to have dinner at this restaurant. Believe me... this restaurant is excellent!!!! You should definitely try the fish dishes! The restaurant is very central and close to the Alster. Inside the restaurant decoration is cozy and very welcoming. The service was excellent. She was always checking if we have everything and if we need anything. Very friendly and communicative.My husband and I decided to order a fish dish.The plaice was served with little shrimps, roast potatoes and side salad. It was soooooo DELICIOUS!!! The portion was really good. We are excited to go there again pretty soon!"
4,Fantastic experience and customer service. We accidentaly bought tickets for the wrong day and they let us join the tour anyway. The chocolate is amazing and we had so so so much fun!
4,"I believe this is one of the most beautiful views of Hamburg Hafen from a bar.  You really capture the beauty of not only the Harbor city but can see down the Elbe River for quite some distance. The entire Empire Hotel is chic, and the food is tasty and served with a bit of poshness as most trendy hotels usually incorporate into the overall experience.  The worst thing to discover with going to Lounge 20 Up is when a queue (or long line) develops to head upstairs to the bar area.  Either stand in line or enjoy a few cocktails at the hotel lobby level bar until the line dies down, then head upstairs.  The risk you run of not standing in the roped off line is that when you finally get upstairs, you might NOT easily find anywhere to sit, let alone stand on busier nights.   When it is crowded, you have little to no chance of actually getting close enough to the window to enjoy a city view, but if you finally manage to steal a table with a a view, the sight is gorgeous.. Floor to ceiling glass walls almost make you feel like you will fall.  If you are afraid of heights, your stomach gets a couple butterflies but you get over it pretty quick. Any tourist to Hamburg should come here just for the FREE view of the Harbor alone. What is not free, are the pricey cocktails!  I like to order the champagne mixed cocktails by the glass served in a flute, often with a gooseberry fruit garnish. Do not expect to dance here, it is mainly for cocktails and lounging, but since it is only a 10 minute walk to Reeperbahn, you can be at clubs, bars, other touristy attractions in no time.  It receives 5 Stars for the views of 20Up and the upscale trendy vibe of the hotel facilities and decor. Tip: There is a coat check but on busy nights, this is one of those establishments that frown a bit if you do not check your coat in and request to hold onto it.  You get a quick glance like, ""Oh, you want to hold onto your own jacket/coat?!"""
0,We were two Danish guys being treated very hostile as if they don't foreigners. Don't go there if you're not German
4,"I was there for dinner yesterday evening: a warm atmosphere, a friendly and fast service, typical French meals, excellent quality and very tasteful food! All that for a price that is easily affordable (33€ the 3 course menu).I didn't ate so well since a long time and I can only recommend this restaurant! Advice: reserve a table to be sure to get a place."
4,"Since I moved to Hamburg, I have been searching for the best dim sum place for my weekend ""brunch"", of which I have been doing for years back in my home country. and yes, I am Chinese. I have tried several restaurants, Mei Moon is the real authentic Cantonese one. The owner and chefs are Cantonese, and they have the best taste bud within the whole China. Each dim sum is handmade in house, instead of mass production frozen pieces, which u can buy in chinese supermarket. Highly recommended for people who crave for a good Cantonese yamcha. Thumbs up for the food. However interior and ambient is better at dim sum haus around the corner."
4,Nice Italian restaurant in cute neighborhood. Good service freshly made pasta and bread. Very tasty
4,"The couple who run this place are great. Vampirish, fixed smiles and waxy skin and absolutely perfect to run a gorgeous, gothy bar. Incredible range of absinthe and other drinks. Don't come here when you're in a rush, each drink is lovingly made, which takes a while. But totally worth it, absolutely divine. When I next visit Hamburg with a friend of mine, I'll make sure we go here. I'm making this place a favourite cos they made sure none of my drinks tasted aniseedy!"
4,Really liked the eischnee mit grüntee! The dish takes time to prepare but it's an experience =D
4,"Great food! Great service! Modern and stylish interiorising, and good quality restrooms. (Large portions)"
2,"Tiefenthal is a café that's trying to be a restaurant as well as a bar at once. It's most successful at being an upper class café (and rallying point for yummy mommies and the like) and acceptable for a drink, but I'd avoid the more complex restaurant offerings. There's a simple rule: Tiefenthal is good at simple things - salads, roastbeef and sandwiches. Unfortunately though the chef struggles with anything more fancy; the more expensive, the worse, at least as far as I can speak from my own experiences. The Wiener Schnitzel, for example, is a disgrace and not even cheap. There are about a dozen places I know in Hamburg where you can get a much better quality Schnitzel for the same money (Casse-Croute near Gänsemarkt, for example). Another problem is the service. On a busy, sunny afternoon it can take ages before you get your homemade ice tea (which is wonderful, by the way). Most waiters/waitresses are professional at their job, but on occasion I've had to deal with one particular waitress whose attitude is rather bold (bordering on impertinent). All things considered I wouldn't mind visiting the place every once in a while, as long it's not for proper lunch/dinner. But then again, if you're allergic to the Eppendorf hoi polloi, you should avoid the Tiefenthal at any cost."
2,"Here we go, finally I get to review Ti Breizh. I have been to this restaurant on three separate occasions, twice for workday lunch, and once with family during the weekend. The galettes and crêpes are excellent and traditional. I have always gone with the daily menu consisting of one savory galette and on dessert crêpe. Yesterday was a galette with cooked ham, spinach and roquefort sauce, very tasty. The menu crêpe was chocolate and coconut.So the food is really tasty, and I even want to go back for it. Why 3 stars you ask? Service. This restaurant is so incredibly slow. Yesterday it didn't look too busy, but it took us one hour and 15 minutes from our arrival to our departure. And this was after asking two different waiters to have our crêpes come faster as we had a meeting to attend. This is just not cool for a workday lunch.Get your act together Ti Breizh and make your service go faster than a (French) snail. You deserve more than 3 stars."
4,"They get some fresh fish from the market as a whole, which the guys like to show off, and filet them in the restaurant to make the freshest pieces of fish you can get. Then they are grilled and served in some very unique and excellent way. I loved the flavours they have introduced in the sauces which are not just the standard type of things you will find in a restaurant. A highlight are the gambas flambe and the fresh fish with Mediterranean veggies. Beside the excellent food the service is also great and in addition there is guy playing the guitar (actually he is palying really, really well). Holiday feeling at it's best in a small restaurant in Hamburg."
3,"Have eaten here a few times and have always been impressed with the food, the hospitality and the service. hey, if it's good enough for Cliff Richard..."
3,"We just stopped in for a coffee and snack after a long walk, but was happy with the service and atmosphere. Would like to go back sometime for a more proper meal."
4,"Great asian food, and it's all vegan! Every lunch is only 6,90EUR and includes a soup or spring rolls as starter. (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  My vegetables with tofu and cashews were absolutely delicious! (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  Great food and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."
3,We had a dinner with 15 colleagues there and they seated us in the nice kind of outside area with a roof. It was a little bit tight for 15 people but it was okay.It took a long time until we got our food but that was probably because the restaurant was packed and we were a lot of people.I got the Pizza Vegetarina with extra Artichokes for around 10 Euro and an alcohol free beer. It was very delicious and it just costed 14 Euro in sum.You get a good but not the best pizza.
4,"Luigis is, BY FAR, the best Italian food I've had anywhere in Germany.  The pizza is wood fired and huge...fresh ingredients and superb.  The pasta bolognese was outstanding as well...noodles were perfectly al dente.  I don't ever give five stars...this would have been six stars."
4,"Batman hat den besten Dürüm der Stadt. Ich war schon in vielen Dönerläden, aber nirgends ist das Dürümbrot so gut gemacht wie dort. Für jeden weiter zu empfehlen. Der Preis von 3EUR ist auch an der unteren Grenze der Durchschnittsdönerpreise. Außerdem macht der Dürüm dort so richtig satt, also für Hungrige und Genussleute gleichermaßen eine Top- Adresse!"
4,"So good. This is my second trip to Hamburg and my second time here. Came originally because my gf had raved about their lentil soup, and she's right to do so - it's the best. The pide and lahmacun are delicious. And the main dishes are outstanding. Today I had the yogurt kabab and it was great. Chill vibe, friendly staff, good prices, fantastic food."
4,"Excellent vegetarian food! Great tastes to experience, well-made food. Service was a bit slow, but the food was well worth it! Also a nice seating area outside."
3,"After hearing a lot of good words of this place, we decided to give it a second chance. This time they didn't disappoint us. The food is served really quickly, like 15 mins after we ordered. To be fair, the burger is really really tasty. And I love the sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo. After we finished, there were people waiting in a line for our table. And it is just a normal Tuesday lunch time. Will recommend it to friends, but just be ware that might be long waiting time for the table or the food."
4,"A must for all Greek-food lovers! And it is so affordable! I recently was in Rhodes and comparing the food there and here at the Taverna -- I would say it can't get any authentic than this! My first time here I ordered the Calamari + Chicken soulvaki along with the white house wine -- best combination ever! The atmosphere is great-- really reminds me of Greece also with the loud conversations. The staff are great! We arrived but no tables were available so we had to wait but I believe who was the owner came over and accompanied us and asked if we would like something to drink while we waited! We were then promptly seated and the service is also very speedy here. What I would recommend is the Greek Bifteki -- it is ground meat with stuffed feta cheese, I think it is named differently on the menu-- just ask the servers!!! And with almost every dish you can get either french fries or rice and a greek salad.One thing that made me laugh were the napkins cause on the other side it is a mini-greek dictionary for you with phrases that I learned on my Greek trip!!! On our second time around, again busy as ever, no tables but we were then again asked if we wanted something to drink! This time I tried the octopus salad and the Grill platter (with assrt. meats) -- GREAT!!! YUMMY!!! But one thing I shouldn't have done was eat bits of the bread they place on the table -- the servings are plenty -- so you can always eat the bread after if you are not full from your main dish!Note to self: This place is very affordable (our bill for both outings for 2ppl plus drinks(bottle of wine and beers) and tip came to 25euros) and great location in Schanze! There are plenty of selections of meat, fish, vegetarian, pizza, pasta and salads. They also have some sort of German special also, just look at the daily special board. Oh and did I mention there is also a huge tv screen for all those sport lovers who are supposed to be on a date but can't keep their eyes off the screen;) I am going to try the moussaka next time and the guy next to our table had some sort of sizzling plate -- will have to try that also next time!! And perhaps if you are a big group -- make a reservation! Oh yeah you get shots of Ouzo after you pay! And the bill is not paid at the table-- you go up to the bar!"
3,"I really fancy this place! It is so typical Eimsbüttel! Be it for brunch or dinner, prices are proportional to the quality. Wine offer is short but good. Inventive dishes based on a classical menu with fresh seasonal products, excellent attentive service and the kind of crowd needed for Sunday night after sports. I just had Seeteufel, perfectly cooked served with tomatoes filled with ratatouille: delicious and beautiful! Otherwise the big salad with tuna fish is great as a reasonable dinner. Enjoy sitting outside if the weather allows it, and watch Eimsbüttel life around you.Avoid the pasta, on a second thought, apart from pasta with shrimps, I've eaten better pasta in my life But I can be pretty picky.English spoken, but not a surprise for the whole neighbourhood."
4,I LOVE CURRYWURST.  Sometimes I feel like I'm an addict.  Mo-Grill gets my thumbs up!  This place is amazing if your looking for a quick-bite to eat.  I want to tell you NOW...that this is one of the best CurryWurst I have had since I been here.  I work close by here now so its convenient for me to stop by once in a while...(can't be eating too much fast food) but DANG this place is awesome.  They make their own curry sauce and the wurst is juicy and packed with flavor.  THIS PLACE IS DANK.  PERIOD
4,"This is a fantastic beautiful park based near the centre of Hamburg, Lazy sunny afternoons lounging around with friends, playing frisbee, lovely walks this is the place to be. There is a good childrens play area, and a paddling pool. Theres a large pond where you can sail remote control boats etc. There are lots of trees and pathways and you can see the planetarium from the edge of the park. Really nice place to relax."

1,"Two stars for the mouse I saw after finishing my meal. But then again I saw two big rats in a trendy restaurant in Paris!For starters the soup was delicious, disappointed with main course as I ordered fish that turned out to cold served (not mentioned on the menu), very oily potatoes, some cream on the fish. I just had the fish and salad. The fish wasn't bad after accepting the facts. p.s. look for the fish in the fish"
3,"When I thought we wouldn't find good pizza in Hamburg, my hubby found this spot! The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven which you can see from the dining room. The pies are huge! We had trouble finishing the two that we ordered and had to bring them home to have for lunch the next day.I ordered the ham with mushrooms while my hubby ordered the pizza parma. Both were very yummy. The pizza dough was nice and thin and had that bit of chewiness. The toppings were good, though I think they are a bit heavy-handed on the cheese. This place has a great lunch deal, which I probably could not partake in because it would be a trek from where I work, but the regular menu will do just fine."
4,I am in love with this place. The coffee... the food... the decor and the staff... all top notch. Such a nice atmosphere! My friend and I sat at the window and enjoyed a latte and a Guatemalan Filterkaffee & Käsekuchen. We liked it so much we even stayed for a second cup! Staff was knowledgeable about the different types of coffee and took the time to explain each one. Thank you for the great service and the tasty treats!
4,"My husband and I were craving a US diner style breakfast and found Mamalicious on Yelp. It by far surpassed our expectations and absolutely hit the spot for breakfast.We ordered the original eggs benedict, a side or chocolate chip pancakes and bottomless coffee. Everything was soooooo good.  Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian but the meat substitutes that came on our eggs benedict was delicious even by my bacon-loving husband's standards. The service was very friendly, the price was right, the filter coffee was great and the venue was very cute and cozy. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were there right after they opened. So we will keep that in mind the next time we come back. All in all, I think this will become a favorite of ours in Hamburg. So excited to have found this place!"
4,"Absolutely great food at the in house restaurant. The Chef made easy, healthy fare of the baked Perch fish with a creamy (basil?) potato side €13, green salad was super fresh €6 and tasty soda bread with a mustard honey butter spread. The hotel rooms are small but very nicely appointed, firm beds, goose down comforters and clean."
3,"Don't come here in the winter! No, seriously, this is an outdoor beach bar! Hamburg beach clubs have a number of things in common: - slightly expensive drinks- mellow, never-ending dance music- lots of sun loungers- lots of sand On a warm sunny afternoon/evening Central Park is one of the best places to hang out in the Schanze"
3,"Südhang has a really great, warm friendly atmosphere. I was there on a Monday evening after a day of mooching around Hamburg and wanted a nice glass of wine to finish the day. I got to test first which is great. The staff were all really friendly and welcoming. Would defiantly go again. I think it's a great first date location, nice lighting, mellow and calm atmosphere."
2,"I dig Burgerlich for the very novel ordering system. If you sit inside, every seat has its own pop-up order screen. If you're not native German speakers like we are, this is a super easy way to order. All items on the menu have correlating pictures so you know exactly what you're getting. We both ordered the cheeseburger, mine with a fried egg and his with bacon. We also ordered a side salad and onion rings. The food came out fast! I was impressed. The burger itself tasted OK. The patty was maybe a little too bland for my taste. I did very much like the tomato relish spread on the bottom bun. I would've wanted extra of that. The brioche bun was also rather awesome. It held the burger together very well. The salad was nothing special, but we did really like the onion rings. The batter was super crispy and I enjoyed the touch of rosemary in the batter.This is a great place for a quick burger fix and to bring a big group of people. Everyone can easily order what they want and pay individually since you pay up front with a card that you use to scan in your order. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the place itself is a really cool looking spot. Though the burgers aren't the best I've had, I would come back with friends in tow."
4,"Excellent little quiet bar, great beers, friendly staff, food looked very good, though we didn't eat here ourselves"
3,A staple Döner spot in the Jarrestadt. They are very quick and efficient in preparing the Döner and friendly enough. We've tried the falafel durüm and the Döner wrap and both liked it. Just wish the spicy sauce would be a bit more spicy! Prices are also good and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated with outdoor seating.
3,"Fantastic burgers! Good service. Wonderful ambiance. Cool designs. Just a very joyful experience here at Shiso Burger. Had the Salmon burger with fries and a coke and after first taste i can easily say that Shiso is a place to go for a really fantastic fish burger and others as well.Only thing, the sits are not the coziest and the prices are a little high for drinks with a combo menu. Also wasn't the easiest place to find, but in the end, I still recommend and will go again."
3,"Came on Phil's recommendation, but they didn't seem to be doing a normal breakfast. There seemed to be only two choices: scrambled eggs or muesli. I went for the scrambled eggs with bacon. It was a nice, if unspectacular, breakfast."
4,"Possibly one of the best falafel in Hamburg! Really tasty!! Nice chunky vegetables and quality food for only 3.5 Euros. It's a bargain and you can eat in too, sweet little mezzanine."
3,"Tasteful menu, craft beers, and bowling alley in the basementIf you like a modern international fare that focuses on German/European food I highly recommend the Freischwimmer.The restaurant comes with a sleek and dark design inside and a cozy beer garden outside. Plus, there is a fun two-lane bowling alley (ninepins) in the basement that you can rent before or after dinner!During my last visit with friends we had the 'calamaretti' (filled calamari), the EURO2016 Burger with cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola, the steak fritte and the Roast beef.Everything tasted great, and I would order it again, especially the calamaretti! However, the burger's toppings (cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola) could have been more.Besides a great menu, the drinks are great, as is the beer on tap and their craft beer selection as well.A nice finish for a fun evening with friends is the bowling alley! We had so much fun that we will be back for sure!+ tasteful diversified menu (changes monthly!)+ good drinks, wine and beer menu+ prompt service and fun hosts+ not very noisy for a restaurant+ cozy beer garden+ fun bowling alley in the basement+ metro train right next door Average entrée: EUR 18Credit cards accepted.Mon-Sun from 5pm"
4,"Like its St. Georg outlet cousin, Luicella's deserves the long line-ups on warm days - simply for the quality of their great ice cream. And given the location, you might even find more days without those long line-ups.This is a smaller place with a smaller assortment, and it's lacking the cute seating spaces.But they stock all their favorites, they will also give you an additional flavor to try out, and the taste is simply awesome."
4,"I went to Oma's Apotheke (which is not a chemist!) for the first time last night. I was really pleasantly surprised. I've always previously crossed the road to Franck und Frei, but I have to say, the steak in here is even better. Lashings of absolutely delicious creamy pepper sauce, with great thin cut fried potatoes instead of fries (you can have either), and quick service considering how busy it was. My friend had the salad which was also huge, and neither of us finished despite going in hungry. Definitely worth a look."
2,"Crikey! All you can eat chicken wings! But only on Tuesdays and Sundays. Going with a larger group helps. Then you can try everything! Every order, of your all-you-can-eat wings, comes with about 6 or so wings on a plate. And they have 18 different flavors to choose from.I ate a ton here. Too much, I would say. So much so that I definitely did not want to see cooked chicken again on a plate for like at least a day or something. :o)My favorite styles were ""Germany"" (honey mustard) and ""Denmark"" (a special remoulade). All of the other wings we tried were pretty decent. The ""Thailand"" style was actually much spicier than the ""Australian"" one which was purported to be ""Hot like hell."" It's a pretty fun spot overall, especially for groups, and it's actually located below street level...or...down under!"
4,"If you ever want to take friends out in Hamburg, make sure you visit this place first. The setting of within the gay area Talstraße with its drag-prostitutes might be a bit unusual at first but the 3-zimmer-wohnung totally makes up for it. The interior is amazing, the bar staff very friendly and the prices cheap! They have special evenings where a guy reads poems and short stories in German, which is quite entertaining and the foosball basement hosts various tounaments.Oh, and the ancient dildo collection is a must-see! Apparently they found this sealed room underneath the bar and when they broke it open, they found all these old dildos. They put them in display cabinets around the foosball tables. Go and check them out!"
1,"Nice bar a bit loud can't really have a conversation, we booked a table for 14 at 18pm  pm and at 21 pm was asked to leave even though we wanted to order more drinks, I think I won't be going back again , why would you ask people who ordered dinner and drinks to leave after 3 hours it's so unprofessional!"
4,Excellent cakes and hot chocolate/coffee. Really chilled and a great place to pit stop whilst exploring Hamburg. Highly recommend!
3,"A nice cafe sneaked away in a small pedestrian street offering tasty breakfast options like french toasts, pancakes or english breakfast.  The service can be a little slow but the food is great."
4,"It's no secret that I'm in love with Lena. However, even if that were not true, I would still give Karlsons five whole Qype stars, as it's truly fantastic. I love the light, airy feel of the place, reminding me somewhat of cafes and bars just north of here, in Copenhagen. Down to business. There's a buffet for sandwiches and salads, but hot food is served at the table. The highlights today were Swedish meatballs, a delicious fish soup, and Danish hot dogs. These dishes proved so popular certain team members even had 2 dinners! (no names mentioned David) Moving on to dessert, and we were delighted to find out Lena had bee up since 4am baking, and the fruits of the oven were indeed mouthwatering - particularly the carrot cake. It's a shame I'm leaving Hamburg today, otherwise I suppose I would have deserted the Milchbar for my new belle Karlsons..."
4,"It's refreshing to see a kebab shop that is always packed full of people! This bustling little place is the closest I've seen to a kebab place merging with a bar. The staff are really funny, and always seem to make up a randomly lower price than the menu. When you ask for beers they fill up a carrier bag with load without enquiring as to how many you wanted! I love it. Food wise there's a massive selection of healthy stuff, including a lot of roasted veg, humous, rice, unleven bread etc. You won't get bored... ... and the killer factor? It's at the end of my road. Mr. Kebab  Dubara. Fact.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=D7Nx…"
4,"This is actually the first place I've been in Hamburg when I first came here, so it's kind of special for me cause it brings up a lot of good memories, sensations and people. It's a great place to go if the weather is good and chill a bit drinking a beer or watching a football game, i.e. during the World Cup or the Europeans."
3,"Met an english group here a few times, solid service considering there were so many of us, close to a station as well."
3,"I went here for take-away coffee a few times when I was looking for an apartment in the area. I liked that they have outdoor seating so I could sit outside in the sun between apartment visitings in order to drink coffee and read comic books. Coffee was just okay, though, but service was rather exceptionally cheery. Never got an apartment in the area, but if I would have, I'd hop in here from time to time."
4,"If you don't mind that it's quite packed, you'll love the place. The food is excellent and there's a wide choice, the atmosphere is very cozy, and the prices are not too high."
3,Pretty good place for a burrito. not the cheapest place to eat but great food.
2,"(my visit was in October 2015)I found Schmilinsky Weinbistro on Yelp. It's a small restaurant tucked into the basement of a hotel.The service is nice. There's one server to cover all of the tables, but with a limited number of tables, the workload is manageable. My server was really nice and helped translate the menu to English for me.After placing my order, I waited a painfully long time for my food. From the time I sat down to the time my food came, 60 minutes had elapsed. Painful!The food was good, though I found some bones in my fish. The person who prepped the fish should be more careful. But yum, that crispy skin was good.Lentils under the fish were a little salty (like a lot of food in Germany), but good. The mashed potatoes were good, but some chunks were too big.I had a glass of house wine that was also good, but I admit that I'm no connoisseur.I liked the feel, the food was good, and I want to support small businesses, but they have to fix the wait time issue."
4,Lot of ppl waiting to get in. Got a seat after 20min without a reservation. The food was great and well priced. Liked the Red sake mojito!
4,"Wonderful new little cafe serving home cooked food and thoughtfully sourced coffee and teas. The owners are kind and passionate about the quality of the ingredients they use, which hasn't gone unnoticed by locals as they regularly sell out of what they have on offer. There are also items from their family farm for sale and free wifi :)"
2,"Pizza okay, Service langsam. Für einen Haps zwischendurch geeignet!"
3,"Ich habe gestern wie immer gutes Sushi bekommen, mussten auch nur kurz warten aber das ist ja kein Problem im jeden anderen Restaurant muss ich auch auf mein Essen warten.  Das nebeneinander sitzen finde ich bei gewissen Nachbarn sogar ganz geil, ich meine die Leute müssen ja auch nicht ihre intimen Pärechengespräche in einem Restaurant führen.  Nur 4 Sterne weil es gestern echt lange gedauert hat bis mal eine andere Sorte Sushi auf dem Band war."
3,A very interesting mock up of different location. we went there my friends kids 6-8 and they had a blast.
2,"Have been to the Ganghi on many occasions and every single time we have had a great meal with excellent service. The staff have got to be some of the most friendly people I've met. Nothing was too much trouble, they even offered to prepare a dish I couldn't find on the menu. This has become one of my favourite places in Hamburg, especially good after being on the road all day and you just want great food and to wind down."
4,"Rodizio is one of my fave restaurant here in Hamburg. The price is abit steep, but for the amount of food you will get at their eat-all-you-can , it is worth it esp for meat lovers. The 'servers' go around with their meats/side dishes from table to table. They will serve it to you straight to your plate. If it's a meat, they will slice it infront of you. You need to book with them 3-4weeks in advance if you wish to dine with them on a Saturday night. If you are looking for a ""quiet"" place to dine, this is NOT for you. If you wanted to go for 'ala carte', again - this place is NOT for you."
0,"Horrible food. Will never dare to order it again. I ordered the food online. So, can not comment on the ambience"
3,"Why has nobody ever reviewed Rosi's Bar in English? Could it be because whenever the English end up this far into a St. Pauli weekender they can no longer differentiate between any of the bars on Hamburgerberg?! I suspect so. Anyway, Rosi's trivia: the girl with the dreads from Zoe 2 DJ's here at the weekends sometimes. It's always packed Thursday till Sunday morning. It doesn't look anything like the photo, cause you have to imagine the mass of people sprawled on the pavement. All good fun, and probably better than the Reeperbahn"
2,"We tried this place out due to all the positive reviews. We picked up our food and ate at home. First big miss: they forgot to include the Wasabi. Second big miss: big sushi pieces (lots of rice) but too little of the rest....you taste rice more than fish. Finally not really authentic Japanese. The folks there were super nice but I believe either Turkish or something else Middle Eastern. You could tell from the sushi pieces that this place was made for German palates where it's more about filling you up than delivering high end fish. Sure there is a crowd for this and they obviously like this place. If that's your thing, you'll be happy here. I believe the quality is OK and you could do worse. If you are into good sushi though, you may want to go up a class or two in sushi joint. It really is a totally different eating experience getting higher quality stuff. I don't eat sushi to get stuffed. I eat it for the quality and taste and you're just not going to get that at this place. Again super nice people and they do fulfill a very specific niche but this is not truly Japanese grade sushi."
3,Great crepes! We went for one savoury and one sweet and neither my friend or I were disappointed. We sat outside on the river terrace too which was lovely as it was so hot. A great spot in Hamburg!
4,"I've been here quite a few times and never left disappointed. The place is and the music is always quite nice and chilled out, and Croques are delicious. I'll come back and I can definitely recommend it."
3,"Always busy, always full like most Burger restaurants nowadays. You should always plan with a 15-20min wait. The waitress takes your name and calls you up when a table is free. They are very quick and friendly. The burgers are very yummy and the food arrives fast. The only thing I miss when I eat here is that they don't really have dessert. They also have a small selection of cocktails but I wish they had more or at least that they were a bit bigger for the price..."
3,"On our first night in Hamburg after making the big move from SF, we had our celebratory dinner here. Badshah wasn't hard to find though the signage might not be super obvious when it's dark. The restaurant is pretty small, but tables seem to turn quite fast. We each ordered the Thali plate, mine with the chicken tikka masala and his with the palak paneer. Both were very tasty. I ordered the mango lassi as well and it was probably one of the better mango lassis I've had. Service was quick, the staff was friendly and price point was decent. Overall, very on par with anything we'd get in San Francisco, which is great!"
4,"This is so far the best place to eat in Hamburg. Great location. Excellent food. Really the best. Loved herrings, all different kinds of potato dishes. Beer and Schnitzel also. Cute decors."
1,"Beer review only.The beer here is very, very good. I could drink it all day long. And for the location and taste, the prices are fair. The restaurant is clean, and overlooking the water can be nice on a warm day with boats and people floating by.But, I'm never coming back here. The people are horrible. At first, I walked up to the bar because it wasn't clear. When I tried to order, the guy basically told me ""no, you'll sit down, it's full service here"" in a very rude German tone. When I looked shocked, he assumed I didn't speak German (I do) and repeated it in English. Then he asked if I spoke English, because I was still a bit shocked at his tone. ""You sure don't seem like you speak English either"" was his response. I should have left then...but I didn't. So, I grabbed a seat and apparently ""full service"" is German slang for ""slow as hell service"". It was 15 minutes until I got a beer. The refill took just as long. And it wasn't because my server (who wasn't as rude, but was far from friendly) wasn't working hard. Indeed, she was working TOO hard and had TOO many tables, so everyone's service suffered.As I mentioned, good beer, but I'll never be back. The people are rude, the service is slow. Horrible place from that standpoint."
3,A great local bar - nice clientele and owner. Good select of beers. A great place for a night out. Smoky though - like most German bars
0,Food is bland and service was worst. Very rude servers (young and old)!!! They all seemed pissed off that there's people in the restaurant! Never-ever again even if I'm starving and it's next to the hotel!
2,"Well, what can I say? Borcher's is the place you went to in the 80s when you were fed up with all that neon shit.In exchange you got some tavern-like wood furniture, with lame and boring folks.Nothing no changed here since the 80s. Even the music - I mean: SOLID AS A ROCK blaring from the speakers. C'mon, seriously?Hadn't tastes other than their home brewed beer, which is okay."
4,Probably the best colourful I have ever had. Highly recommend are coming here and eating their falafel plate.
4,"Very good quality Turkish food, great atmosphere and nice stuff. Very affordable. Mr. Kebab, I love you."
4,"Love this place! Such a great and friendly atmosphere - the waiters and owner make you feel welcome! Be sure to reserve seats, it's a small place and very popular. There is no menu, everyone gets the 4-course Spanish/Portugese meal (suitable to you if you are vegetarian, for ex). Live music from a singer/guitarist included (loud then, otherwise ok). A fun time!"
3,"Fun spot! Great views of the Hamburg Hafen and City. For the location and dress code the prices are reasonable. We had a lovely waitress and the drinks were perfectly mixed. A table may be hard to come by as this spot becomes more and more popular, so even on a Monday night it may be best to call ahead."
4,"The Bird could use a little more atmosphere, but it's early days and the food and the staff are just so awesome, it deserves the full five stars. Sadly though I think the sheer class of the Bird is a bit wasted on the Hamburgers, with their naff Croques and Jim Blocks. This is greasy, hearty Americana at it's best. Spread the word."
4,"Visiting Hamburg for 6 days and we've decided to have dinner again at Xeom.Loved the food and service.Great food, atmosphere and a very fair price."
3,"YES, get a Hamburger in Hamburg!!Fun place, good vibe, youthful crowd. St.Pauli area of Hamburg. English widen spoken. Good music from the 70's & 80's.  HUGE 1/2 lb thick burgers, order them MEDIUM RARE 4 juicy. Tiny ""Hamburger Buns?""( more similar to English muffins....DUDE?! WTF? Soggy fries :-((( even begging first to make them well cooked, they haven't a clue how to cook FF!"
4,"Good place on a side street with open-air sitting available. Very nice, fast and welcomming service."
3,"If you come to Hamburg on Sunday morning you will visit the Fischmarkt. You have to be there very early and after a walk and bargaining with different Fischmarkt-sellers, you will need a place to chill. If you follow the way from Fischmarkt to St. Pauli-Landungsbrücken, you pass Strand Pauli (that means Beach Pauli. And if it is summer and if the sun shines, you can sit on sofas or beachchairs or even lie on a queensize bed, drink Cocktails or have a breakfast, or snacks like Hamburger. The prices are a little bit higher than in a Pub - but when you see, that you have a beach in the harbour and can watch the ships passing by (as we saw the Sadov today) it is worth the money. We paid 10 Euros for 3 very well served non alcoholic drinks."
4,"The stuff there was really kind! Big portions, i tried 3 times. But I could never finish all  vegeterian burger with beans was really tasty! Worth trying."
3,"Great Coffee, Muffins and Soup! I have not tried their other offerings, but this small cafe is full every day at lunch and throughout the day with people picking up coffee to go. Wonderful location right at the Hallerstrasse U1 entrance, Make sure to get a frequent buyer card!"
2,"I was in town on business. I usually take the time to find the local Hard Rock to pick up a magnet from the shop if it is my first time in the city. This time I decided to stop into the restaurant for a late lunch as well.Location: An odd location in that it is not in the ""central"" Hamburg area. Unique, though, as it is within an old port building featuring great views of the port waterways.Food: Solid burger and ok beer selection. Portion was quite large, though, so come hungry.Service: Rather poor. I was there after the lunch rush and the restaurant was pretty empty. I figured I'd be in and out of there pretty quickly, but alas, not to be. My server was quick to the table when I first sat down, however, it was rather tough to get her attention once my food arrived. Spent more time chatting and laughing with the bar staff."
2,"This was a tough star rating, because there are definitely things I really enjoy about CIU but things I am so so indifferent to as well. I wanted to give it more a 3.5 star rating but (don't laugh!) I can not figure out yet how to scroll to a half star.  Maybe it is something special for ""professional Yelper"" to access, but right now I am earning my wings by rating my favorite things :)Ok, so what do I like about CIU? The atmosphere, the pretty looking bar arrangement, the music, and coming with a friend or friends in a group for cocktails to get yourself prepared to go clubbing/dancing somewhere later if you come on the weekend. If you come during the week, its nice to grab a high table behind the bar, order some world class drinks with fruits hanging all over the place that practically overwhelm the glass itself, and enjoy music with a friend and feel like you kinda went out, but without really doing it up too crazy. What is just okay about the place? Location, it is a bit of a walk unless you are driving by car or dropped off by taxi.  If you are wearing flat shoes, it is no problem at all, but if you are wearing heels and getting off at Jungfernstieg, then its a bit of a ""spazieren gehen"" lovely scenic walk as they might say in Germany.  At least you can walk up Ballindamm next to the lake, I mean the Alster just makes everything THAT much BETTER :)  The food is also just ""okay"" and they stop serving kinda early, considering most people like to drink and eat a bit later here, since it is busier between 7pm and 10pm, so if you try to come late to beat the cocktail rush, you also miss the opportunity to eat.The menu mainly consists of pizzas, salads, pastas and some general appetizers. The drinks really is the real reason most people come here and the music as they have a live DJ that spins good tracks.  For girls and even guys who are not shy to drink a cocktail with an elaborate fruit arrangement sprouting out of the glass, their specialty drinks here are nice to try and taste like an alcoholic dessert more or less. I sometimes am in the mood to enjoy a good martini, but I tried to order it here once and I was not crazy about it.  Martinis are not made equally in Europe vs. the US.  And funnily enough, James Bond was in international man of mystery who loved Martinis, so I wonder where he ordered his????"
3,"I highly recommend this place, it's a lot cooler and more local than all the touristy spots on the reeperbahn, and it's a bit of an older and more hip crowd (mostly people 30s and above, but I'm not even 20 and didn't feel weird at all). We were the only non-Germans it seemed like. It took us a while to get our cocktails, and they weren't exactly cheep, but it was well worth it because they were AMZING. Best cocktails I've ever had, and shots are pretty well priced! The interior of the bar is super funky, the bartenders are fun, beautiful, and amazing, and all the people here were so friendly. All in all this place has a great vibe and we had a really fun Saturday night!"
3,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Joh Albrecht. Been there several times. If I have friends visiting Hamburg, it is probably the place I take them to. They got a good view of the canal if you are lucking getting a table next to the window. They have really good Flammkuchen. I've ordered it every time I got there. I've tried schweinshaxe and schnitzel once or twice. Not impressive. Beer is good though. The place is good for group. They have a lot of long tables."
3,"High quality, delicious meat and sides. I ordered the rinderbraten oder (salted beef) with gravy, red cabbage, and krout. Each plate (you can choose large or normal sized) come with two sides. The choices are side salad, mashed or diced potatoes, red cabbage, and krout.The red cabbage and krout were sweeter than most I've tried. I particularly enjoyed the krout and was told it's both ""sour and sweet"" krout. There are also three types of mustard: süß (meaning sweet, seemed like a honey mustard), and scharf (meaning sharp, very strong) and mittel-scharf (meaning medium-sharp, still very strong)."
4,Excellent food and service. Nice location with plenty of outside seating. Great jazz music and local beer on tap. Strongly recommend.
2,From 1 (worst) to 5 (best)Food taste: 3 Good.Food variety: 4 Many.Price: 3 ModerateMobility: 5 Easy by public and private transport. Recommendation and comment:Many would find the taste is good.
2,burger relatively dry. no even real burger bread. side order of wedges was a total joke.
4,"Finally, I am glad that provide Vietnamese coffee yay! Hard to find Vietnamese larger in Hamburg, Germany!"
0,"My husband and I tried Chicago Meatpackers a couple of times and I've been sorely disappointed. The first time they ran out of hamburger buns. Hamburgers are their specialty so it goes without saying it was a disappointment. The second time, we ordered burgers and I didn't think the meat tasted very fresh. In fact, it had a strange and unappealing taste. I won't be going back."
4,"Not often does one feels ""OMG! This is so much food (also tasty ;)) for such less money!"" It happened to me and my friend last night. The food was only more than sufficient for the two of us (we eat a lot, trust me!). It was spicy enough, tasty and appetizing. The service was okay and the ambience was decent. The place might not be romantic but you'd definitely want to romance the food they serve ;) I would definitely go there again and recommend it to any food lover, who loves spicy food :)"
4,Nr. 88 +++++
4,"If you're hungry, don't worry, this place serve you heaps of good food to a great price. Awesome afterwork place for everyone how wanna have something to eat or just a beer."
4,It was pretty delicious ! Haven't had such a great falafel  in ages :) thanks ! Will be back soon
2,Das Essen ist ganz gut und der Service ist auch sehr nett. Aber irgendwie fehlt mir hier der pfiff. Warum kann ich auch nicht genau sagen aber bisher war ich 2x da und ich war nicht ganz überzeugt aber ich komme bestimmt wieder!
3,"Passing by one Sunday night, I saw the sign outside for Irish music night.  I'm a sucker for any chance of hearing a fiddle, so I popped in, wandered through the upstairs, and found my way down to the basement bar.What I found there was better than I'd possibly imagined --- 15 people with fiddles, pipes, Irish Bodhran drums, guitars --- I even saw a bass leaned against a wall, but not in use.  Good rollicking jigs, and several hours of them.  All instrumentals, which suited me fine.At one point I figured the only way to tell which country I was in was to listen to the two older guys having a loud conversation instead of listening --- and notice they were speaking German.Upstairs is fairly standard ""Irish pub"" look, but the basement decor's a bit odd --- the plaster is painted like huge wood beams and stone walls with ""windows"" opening out on blacklight-illuminated fantasy scenes.  One section of the wall has a sea god who belongs airbrushed on the side of a van.  Very odd.Food, eh?  The Guinness was excellent (though a half-liter instead of a pint), and the fish and chips was much better than I'd expected --- I'd rate it as a good but not excellent chippy.  I'll have to go try something meat-pie-ish, as that's a better way to judge the kitchen.The food was good, the beer was good, and the music was amazing --- I know for sure what I'm doing next time I'm in Hamburg on a Sunday."
2,"Well , just had a falafel here once for 3,50 , not great ,but a great place when ur hungry and your pocket is tight"
3,"One of those cafe's that you don't find that often. Small, nice and calm feeling. Almost as stepping in to a livingroom. The coffe is great."
3,"Fabulous brunch on Sunday! A bit pricy but it includes juices and coffee, so actually just fine.. lots of veggies, warm and cold dishes...... nice service... great bread... all good!"
4,We were staying nearby so decided to try it out. We liked it so much that we ended up coming here consistently our entire short stay in Hamburg. Staff is incredibly friendly and the space is minimally but very nicely designed. I tried both the cappuccino and flat white and preferred the cappuccino. The carrot cake is the best I've ever had. Ever. The cake itself is rich and not sweet with a wonderful texture and the frosting is buttery and delicious. Perfect! Will return the next time I find myself in Hamburg.
4,"Given the price and the fact that literally nothing on the menu exceeds 7 EUR, it's an awesome place to have lunch. It offers not only must-have Turkish options but also some less common dishes. Everything is super yummy and the service is prompt.  The downside is that the line is usually long and they are open only Mon-Fri around lunchtime."
4,"Honestly one of the best tourist attractions in the world. You absolutely must see this place at some point in your life. Miniatur Wunderland is a massive museum of models. It started out as just model railways, and indeed railways do continue to make up a significant portion of the place, but it's expanded to so much more. There are glorious mountainous scenes, recreations of the world's great cities, and piles and piles of cars and humans as well. My personal favourite is the model airport, with a huge selection of planes, terminals, fuel trucks, passengers. Literally everything has been thought of. The planes even land and take off in front of your eyes! Tremendous!The detail throughout the place is astounding. I literally spent 10 minutes just staring at the football stadium, where a match between Hamburg and St. Pauli was happening. The spectator's excitement, the floodlights. Top class. Another little detail that caught my eye was when I peered into a random office building, and saw two colleagues secretly kissing in the office. A tiny detail that most people probably don't see, but it is so realistic and well thought-out. I'm sure these details are evident throughout the Wunderland. Would love to hear about some others from people. :)It's well worth the entrance cost. You can really see where your money is going when you pass by the workshop and see the newer areas being constructed. I can't even imagine the sheer number of hours that went into creating this, and there's more being built all the time. By paying your entry fee, you are helping create something amazing!There is a shop and restaurant on site, both of which are reasonably priced, and have a selection of stuff. The shop has a huge variety of models and toys and collectibles. The restaurant interior is designed to look like sitting on a train or in an aeroplane. Very cool.In conclusion, if you're anywhere close to Hamburg, please PLEASE visit Miniatur Wunderland. I don't regret it one bit, and hope to be back to see your new creations in the future. :D"
3,"Cool, hip and funky. We sat on sofas in the window and didn't want to get up!Reggae easing through the speakers, cold augustiner and friendly bar staff. We were immediately give a glass of free nibbles which is always an a+ in my book.Wanted to have a quick drink and then meet friends but that turned into a few drinks and a change of plans, friends came to us and we chilled out and watched as the sun went down and the area came to life.(One little note for the geeks: dyson airblade in the wc, for me its cool when places use up to date technology!!!)Go there, you wont regret it!!"
3,What a lovely place.Excellent price value ratio!!We had seafood only!Catch of the day was wonderful.Some very good wines from Portugal and Spain. Quick and friendly service!Location in the heartbeat of Hamburg (Schanze)
3,"Joh. Albrecht is a large, central, brewery restaurant that serves predominantly German fare. I've only been once, and then only for the beer, which is very good. I keep on telling myself I should go and try their lunch menu, as it's so close to where I work"
4,"Tasty food. I've been in Europe for 2 months and this was my first burger since being here... I was very pleased! I had the BBQ burger and I would definitely recommend it! I got the menu, which ended up being a bit too much food for me, but it was worth the price."
4,"Best Dim Sum House in Hamburg! After a long but worthwhile wait, Restaurant Mr He finally reopened (after their neighbour burnt down). We went hoping everything would still taste as delicious and authentic as it did and we were not disappointed! The same super friendly waitress was there. The custard buns are to die for, which we always order a portion to takeaway, and so are the xo sauce turnip cakes and pretty much just everything. We highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Cantonese dishes. The prices are worth paying for the quality food and they're not more expensive than other dim sum places."
2,"Average little thai place. The prices are decent for the Schanze, but the food is only good, not great. Will I go again? Probably not, I know somewhere in St Pauli that I much prefer, and if I wanted a full restaurant experience, then they're also out of luck, because they're not really a restaurant."
4,"Amazing turkish place in the Hamburg city center...!!! Service is super fast, I really like this!! You can enjoy a huge choice of turkish food: donner, cous cous, felafel, rice, etc.Everything is so good and really cheep! Perfect if you want to enjoy a quick lunch with co-workers.Perfect for eating inside or for take-away. Please not that it could become crowded around 12."
3,"One of my favourite bars in Hamburg. Very friendly and sociable staff, comfortable sofas, relaxed atmosphere and great cocktails at reasonable prices."
2,"I was taken by a friend here. Had heard of it before but never actually thought of going. I was quite excited to find another steak place as I love good meat. Anyway, came here to first be greeted by the horrible smell at the entrance of the buidling. OK, it's a meat market so I can understand the smell but it's just not the first impression you want when walking into a restaurant. Once upstairs, the decor is a bit bland and old fashioned. The night we were there it was also packed with senior citizens. We were by far the youngest there (outside of staff) and we're in our mid-thirties. Nevertheless, the steak was OK. I wouldn't say it was anything more than average though. I found the meat a bit tough as well. Service was quite good on the night we were there but in summary, decent meat and good service is the opposite of what I expected. Actually had the meat been better, I would of cared far less about everything else."
4,"Probably the most comfy bar in the Sternschanze area. It is crammed with couches, a smoking area is in the basement.ZIII has an adequate amount of drinks on the menu, but no food. That shouldn't be a problem, the Sternschanze is bustling with places to eat.Prices are average and below, drinks are always great.The barmaids seem to be chosen by their great looks and their permanent good mood.English is spoken."
4,Zum Spatzle  is amazing. Do not pass up this charming restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful.  I had the lentils and spatzle and it was fantastic.  I plan to go back and try the soups and more spatzle. Thank you for my first great dining experience in Hamburg.
4,"Wow is all I can say about this restaurant. The atmosphere was lively with an authentic Chinese feel. The food was absolutely fantastic, one of the best meals I've had in Hamburg. I cannot believe I've lived down the street for so long and not came here sooner. Be sure to call ahead because it was packed"
4,"The food is so good , so tasty. Location is not so far from center , you can take bus or train to get there. Services are friendly , they gave you recommendations when you didnt know what to choose. Must-have-to-go restaurent when you are in Hamburg."
3,"Have been here for the first time. I certainly took a while until we got served. And it even took longer until the food was ready... But both, Pizza and Pasta were really great though, do it's worth the time!"
4,Love this place! Great burgers. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Asahi and saké with a Waygu Chesseburger and kimchi is hard to beat!
1,"I was here 3 times. The first 2 times I came here with one person. The food were super super good, then I brought my other 3 friends here with full expectations but we all were disappointed this time. May be we came there at a wrong time (Easter time) or their main chef is on holiday, no idea. They offer Surprises Menu all the time. The first 2 time (2 persons), we had 6 warm+cold appentisers but this time 4 persons only had 5 appentisers and the portion was the same as for 2 persons. The beef was tough and no sauce for the whole dish. When we asked for a ketchup or sauce and they answered it is not their practice to offer sauce. We are very disappointed and don't know what is going on in this restaurant."
4,"It's good old fashion currywurst They have lots of different levels of heat but unlike other places, their curry sauce has lots of good flavor. If you're looking for a quick bit stop here, they owners are friendly and can speak English if needed."
3,"I don't come to Germany for the coffee.  But I stopped by nord coast after hearing about it from a friend and was pleasantly surprised.They make both light roast and dark roast espresso.  I was surprised by this, and inquired with the owner as to why, and he responded that most Germans do not drink anything other than dark roast.  Him and I wink at each other and acknowledge that light roast is where all the flavor and complexity is really at.  I know German culture takes time to adapt.  GERMAN PEOPLE IF YOU'RE READING THIS -- try the light roast it will not harm you.The food is great.  My favorite breakfast I've had so far is the poached egg with pesto, pomegranate, and spinach.  The waffles are pretty good too, with fruit and whipped cream.If you've tried the espresso, then it's worth trying the coffee.  They've got some preparation techniques that are uniquely German (I forget the name but ask one of the folks working there).  I tried one and it was really good.Other highlights: the place is on the canal and has a nice view.  In addition, they are pretty chill so you might wait for your coffee sometimes.  I pestered the staff with a ton of questions and they were nice enough to answer all of them!"
4,"A friend of mine brought my mom and I to Plat du Jour for lunch.  It was so cute and French, packed with businessmen and women for lunch.  What a spot to truly enjoy well made food with a lovely ambience.  I had to go back, so I brought my boyfriend and his sister one afternoon.  We each ordered the steak because it sounded and was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant forLunch with friendsLunch with business partners"
2,"Toiled password protected! You will find out that only when you come to it, no tip or any other message. And I'm not that kind of person that keeps receipt:/ got in just because a guy was leaving But coffee is good though expensive. I'd suggest to hang at least a notice at the way to the rest room :/"
2,"Clearly a place to be in Hamburg.  After queuing for 20 min with the others, I could finally see the menu. Overall typical vietnamese choice. Nothing too extravagant.It took them a while to come and take my order.The food was OK, but nothing more. The pho missed fresher herbs and was quite salty. The spring rolls were fresh and crispy as they should be but the dip was rather tasteless. The pork on the bun cha lacked juiciness but had a good taste. Overall the bun was quite cold.All in all not bad, but maybe not worth the wait..."
4,Strongly recommend this place! Genuine turkish experience and turkish breakfast at its best.
3,"Very good value with their 'all you can eat' deal. Tasty, not the best in town but fairly good. Went there with my stepson who very kindly invited me. We had white wine which was nice. Nice place, worth it. We'll go back there."
3,"Get a hamburger in Hamburg (the origin city of the hamburger). This was a major priority in my plan when visiting this city. After passing by some other Yelp recommendations, I finally decided to take the train out here before checking out the St. Pauli Christmas Market nearby. It's about a 5-7 minute walk from the train stop.Arriving in the evening, the place was packed. As in, every single seat was taken. I tried to seat myself at the bar, only to be informed that I still had to put my name down because there were slots of reservations. No biggie. I was fine waiting. Except it seemed like I waited for half an hour or more as I watched groups of people walk in and get seated without reservations. Turns out the hostess thought I was also waiting for a dining companion to arrive thus the multiple snubs. Well, that tells you something about going out to eat by yourself at restaurants here. Rare stuff.Anyway, I finally got to sit at the bar and already having familiarized myself with the menu--there is an awesome disclaimer on the front page about what to expect with their food and how to eat it--I ordered a burger, fries, and beer. It was a hefty portion and the interestingly English-muffin-like bun was tiny compared to the patty, but a decent American-esque meal. Service was fine. Given the crowds, the popularity of The Bird speaks for itself. It's a good place to eat some good food and for the locals to get a taste of the stateside stuff. Seemed like a very social scene in there. The most important tip I will offer you is this: CASH ONLY."
3,"The best about this restaurant is the terrace and the view of the Hafen. When you combine it with a very friendly staff and great food, it's just perfect! We loved both their meals as well as desserts"
2,"Very nice place but I feel like for the price I payed the amount of food was a bit poor, but tasty"
3,Tischreservierung total versemmelt :-/ aber sonst wie immer sehr gut.!!!
2,"If you want to have a quiet night out, and you are a fan of good service, then DO NOT under any circumstances go there on a thursday.On thursdays Sausalitos is a night club, packed with people (in suits surprisingly) who are there for the after work party. Any other day of the week should be rather normal.It claims to be mexican, but well its not - not really, no.But the food is nonetheless good.They have a wide choice and huge portions for acceptable prices.The have a wide choice of cocktails. I like the place.For eating everyday except thursdaysfor partying on thursday night"
4,"Good donairs - crisply roasted bread with chunky lamb meat including enough fatty bits, fresh salad, good sauces - check!Good value for money - be seated with your Mini Döner - check!Friendly staff - check!Cosy in- and exterior in wood and warm colors that feel like Turkey and not like a fast food parlor, including good bathrooms - check!But what really clinches the 5***** is that they seem to be the only(!) donair place in Hamburg that still serves the more expensive lamb meat (for a modest surcharge), which is of course the original Turkish donair meat. Döner Queen nearby doesn't do so any longer - Dubara are the real donair deal."
2,"This big, bustling restaurant is a good place for a comfortable, casual meal with friends. Food is good--nothing memorable, but something for everyone.  Service can be a little challenged at times, but when that happened to us once, before we could even consider complaining, they were right up front with an apology and offer of free after dinner coffees/drinks.  Any restaurant can have an off night, few will acknowledge it, and that gets points from me."
3,"Ahoi itself isn't a luxury place, there not much design about this place. It seem more like a coffee to me, but they also offer some food. They also offers really nice view of the Hamburger Hafen, at the same time, can catch up with friends.Because of it this place is quite popular at the weekend, at least when we were there, it was full of people. Luckily we was able to find free spot to sit down. The place is self-service, have to go inside to order. When the pizza is really, the stuff will bring it out and shout the order number, that's how it works here.For me, I really like it here. Having a lovely drink with such a beautiful harbour in the sunny day. It's really enjoyable. If it isn't too windy, I could stay there for the whole day."
2,Great spot for a lunch! Good menu and fantastic location. I had a great kebab here with fresh ingredients and great flavor. It can get very crowded during lunch time so make sure to have enough time to line up and get your food and you won't me disappointed. Great place!
3,"Apparently, Hamburg does have a beach. It's just hiding in the tiki bars.In all seriousness, it's a relaxing place. Chill out with a Mai Tai, get your butt in a lounge chair, take your shoes off and get them into that sand. On a sunny day, just ignore the container ships going by and you've got yourself an oasis."
2,"Went for the all you can eat wings fro 13.99 euros. It was alright, they have about 14 different flavors. The beers were nice, a large 500ml would be about 4.20 euros which is better than other restaurants. The waitress spoke English so I guess foreigner friendly."
2,Nice Café Bar serving tasty green tea and some fresh selected kind of homemade pies. They were playing cool Music that made a charming atmosphere to our conversation. Quite affordable and almost a standard around the corner. During the Summer the garden is a blast in a students district like that. But somehow the waitress wasn't friendly... WTF ? I will be there again for a beer very soon.
4,"""Hipster coffee place"" has become to mean something different to me. Instead of meaning "" pretentious "" it became to me a sign of ""quality"" . Now I see it as those people are crazy passionate for coffee. Non hipster places often would have quality depending on who is working today. But this place is true hipster. It is always a good expresso no matter who is working today."
3,"I believe this was the first burger joint we dined at in Hamburg and it is still one of my favorites. Yes, the burgers are hard to eat because the patty is shaped pretty much like a baseball and everything is contained between two small english muffins. But everything I've ordered here has been delicious and satisfying. The fries have that homemade quality and you get a lot of it. If you still have room after the giant plate of burger and fries, you have to have the cheese cake, self-proclaimed as the best cheese cake in the world. I believe it! The staff is nice and friendly. Always a good time and delicious food to be had here."
0,"The food was delicious but the service was absolutely terrible. We came in at 5pm and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant, so understaffing was definitely not an issue as we saw many other customers (including the table next to us who came in after us) catered to in a timely matter. First off, they took an incredibly long time to get back to us (~15 mins) so we had to ask the waiter for the menu, to take our order and for the desert menu. The only thing we didn't have to wait 15 minutes then ask for was the water that they initially served us. The final straw for us was dessert. Not only did we have to ask for the desert menu after waiting around 15 minutes for someone to take our plates away, we also had waited around 20 minutes for someone to come take our order for dessert, at which point we both gave up on this horrendous service and decided to just pay and leave. We waited around 5 more minutes to see if anyone would acknowledge us, and to no surprise, no one had came over. We had to walk to the cashier to pay. The whole meal took almost one and a half hours and we only ordered one main course each since we gave up on dessert. I honestly think the Currywurst Kiosk on the Reeperbahn has better service.‍"
2,"I happened to come here with some co-workers for lunch after being told it is hard to find seats. Which in my opinion is a good thing. However, after getting there I see why. There are not many seats there! I also found that the cement benches for seating were not very nice. They are up against a large table that you usually share with other visitors. This is makes it very difficult to get in and out of those seats. The decor is nice though, very retro and creative. The service was just ok. Our server was nice but he seemed to be the only one so was quite busy. The menu is very small and they only have about 3 kinds of pastas and a salad. I had the pasta with pumpkin and chicken. It tasted ok but not very much chicken and the sauce was a bit too watery for my taste, definitely did not taste pumpkin. Overall it was just an ok place. I would probably go back and give it another try but it won't be on the top of my list."
3,"An Irish man in Germany going to an Irish bar to drink German beer. I'm sure there's a joke in there someone. Usually, I am loathe to go to Irish bars when I travel, usually because they are stereotypical. Luckily, Irish Rover is nothing like that. Stone walls and exposed wood gives a great rustic feel to the place. Kilkenny, Guinness, and Bulmers are available, along with a fine selection of Irish whiskeys including a fantastic Tyrconnell 10 year Madeira cask and my personal favourite Green Spot, as well as some lovely German beers.There's a reasonably large patio out the front that over looks a square, and is great to sit in on a warm summer's evening. The staff are friendly, and super accommodating. Reasonably priced, and well located - this is definitely a bar to check out when in Hamburg. I would have liked to have seen a larger selection of beers, so Irish Rover only gets 4 stars."
3,"The Rathaus is a pretty magnificent building right in the heart of Hamburg. You can just wander in off the street. Definitely a must see for visitors to the city, shame I don't know much about the place other than it's impressive. My only niggle with the place is the current exhibition they're running; although I personally don't have anything against it, I think perhaps it's a bit overt for children? So maybe if you're there as a family you might want to check it out before taking them in."
2,"Unique place. Almost without competition in the area.Cool industrial design.Coffee was excellent. It was my taste. Less acid. Cake was OK. We had ""Stachelbeerenkuchen"" and ""Damengedäck"". Very very sweet.Service was quick and friendly. However it took way to long to get our ordered stuff. Ok, it was Saturday afternoon. However a place like this should have a much shorter reaction time."
4,"The Speicherstadt, literally: 'City of Warehouses', meaning warehouse district) in Hamburg, is the largest warehouse district in the world where the buildings stand on timber-pile foundations, oak logs, in this particular case. It is located in the port of Hamburg--within the HafenCity quarter--and was built from 1883 to 1927.The district was built as a free zone to transfer goods without paying customs. As of 2009, both the district and the surrounding area are under redevelopment. As the first site in Hamburg, it was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site on 5 July 2015.The architecture is amazing and you can walk around and explore the buildings from the outside. It's a wonderful part of Hamburg and not to be missed. We walked around here for a long time and some nice cafes and things also in this area."
4,"Leckere Pastagerichte mit Salatbeilage auf Wunsch. Bei Rita schmeckts wirklich prima, ideal fuer den Business Lunch. Im Sommer kann man nett draussen sitzen. Einzig die  guenstige  Preisgestaltung bleibt undurchsichtig: mal kostet Salat extra, mal nicht."
4,"This spot is really charming; between the lit candles, fresh flowers, wife serving and husband cooking, this is exactly what one might envision when dreaming of European bistro. But let's talk about the food: Traditional Northern German. Unfortunately, I did not have time to research a lot before this trip, and ignorantly I assumed I would be limited to spätzle and sausage. Behold!  Labskaus - an old, traditional sea farer's dish, made from potatoes, pickled beef and beetroot, served with gherkins, beetroot and pickled herring. Labskaus reminds me of a non-greasy, light, almost fluffy corned beef hash. It was topped with 2 farm eggs and was divine. I appreciated that I was going to order a side salad but was advised against it because with the beets and gherkins, that would be too much. How honest! I finished with a spot of peppermint and ginger tea - fresh and strong. Between the reasonable prices, quality food and wonderful service, I would highly recommend this spot.Gluten free dining notes: The Labskaus does not contain bread crumbs, soy sauce nor Worchester sauce. Enjoy!The Creme Brûlée, however, is thickened with flour. :("
4,This place is so amazing. We got there at 8:45 am and there were no lines and it was not crowded. You will want to spend several hours looking at the incredible detail. Especially the airport!!
2,"The sitting-on-the-floor option is a novelty thing and fun - for the first five minutes. afterwards you get a bit cramped. there's hardly any space and if you go with more than 4 people, conversation tends to get lost in curry fumes. Yet my friends never seem to get tired of it and always drag me into this place.The food is ok. Even though the menu offers plenty of dishes they tend to taste similar. Some of the dishes are served quite cold so ask if you're unsure. Also stay away from the lassis unless you like sweets with your main course.the service is a bit grumpy and not very talkative. still, it's ok+ food at an ok price at a great location!"
3,They have very delicious truffle burger . That is outstanding. Whenever I am in hamburg I go for this delicious burger place. They have also nice drinks but more German brands( soft drinks). They are polite and quick. They take Covid policy very serious which Is amazing. To burger lovers this place is haven. I recommend Ottos burger  .
2,"Being used to award-winning burgers back in the States, I was hoping that Billy the Butcher would satisfy a month-long burger craving since I moved here. I ended up walking away satisfied, but not blown away. I ordered their maxed out burger, which came with bacon, sautéed onions, and a fried egg. The ingredients were high quality, and the burger was topped with a tasty, albeit too sweet burger sauce. The meat itself was on the bland side, and lacked a proper seasoning. Fries (a separate order, as the burger only comes by itself) were a refreshing mix of about 2/3 regular, and 1/3 sweet potato fries, and came topped with a rosemary based seasoning that was original. For a 13-14 euro lunch meal, it could have been better."
2,"Ciu bar has a lovely location next to the Alster, and it's nicely decorated and serves good drinks, but it's not my kind of bar. It's relatively expensive. It's a bit too shiny. All the customers there look like they earn much more than me and are happy to flaunt it. Yeah, it's just not my kind of place on first impressions. Maybe I'll give it a second chance sometime though."
4,yes it really is the best bratwurst in hamburg. ask for an extra roll of bread as theyre very fresh there
4,"3 Zimmer Wohnung is a hybrid between house-party and laid back pub, with a dose of early 70's flair, a shot of late 90's tune mix and a bunch of people you don't know. Yet. The pub is divided into 4 sections; the kitchen (also the bartop), the living room, the bedroom and a small kicker area. All of these are dimly lit, and have shelves of random books and tidbits scattered around. In the living room, we found a half-dressed Barbie doll and a 1988 Guinness book of Word Records. While I wouldn't actually consider hitting the sack at ""3 Zimmer Wohnung"", it seems to be a great place for a laid-back evening excursion, especially as the music is low enough allow you to have conversations with your buds, but loud enough to sing and jiggle along. Very recommended, can't wait to go back!"
2,"The boat was interesting, but I would definitely not do it again. The whole time all I could think was wow this would be bad if there was a fire and did they get these mannequins from the sex stores on the reaperbahn. Honestly the boat itself was very interesting to see, especially to see how small it was for the sailors. It would have been better if they either hadn't added in the mannequins and plastic food or spent the extra money to get realistic ones. It was actually pretty entertaining trying to find all the mannequins though."
3,"Always lots of people in here.  You order your food at the till, pick it up once your vibrating pad tells you it is ready and off to find your seat.As English in Germany and with very little German, challenge here is reading the menu and ordering.  I don't believe they have an English version of the menu and I never get the sense that the staff have good enough English to help you out but, this is not a complaint on my part as why should they right?  I am in Germany after all.Once I have my colleagues translate and order for me, the food tastes fresh and there is lots off it.  A large bowl of pasta or salad freshly prepared for you and tastes great.I always eat in so not sure if they do take away also.  As with many establishments in Hamburg, I think they only take cash so be warned."
4,"Long live Sommersalon! My friends and I love this place. The music is a great mix of funk, hip hop and R&B - old and new school. The DJ's will stir up some James Brown with Kanye and throw in some Rolling Stones too. It's a really cool vibe. No fancy drinks, but who needs them? And absolutely no mind-numbing, repetitive techno beats. It's never our first stop, but we always end the night there. The dance floor is jumping after 1am. The place itself isn't so pretty, and it gets really crowded but you'll have a good time. Ladies - take tissues. They are always out of toilet paper."
3,"Surprisingly good food. Don't expect any kind of fine dining and the area is horrible outside the door.....it's gentrifying but still a good ways away from being hip. Nevertheless, the food is solid and tasty. Service is quite fast as well and by the amount of people coming in here, you can tell that you are not the first to find this restaurant. Also, the tin serving trays will remind you of prison food. We got a kick out of this but I am sure some people will be put off. Cleanliness is also not necessarily their forte. Note, I don't mean to say the place is dirty or unsanitary. It's simply not polished but in my opinion, that's fine. As long as the food is good, you don't worry about it being unfresh and the prices are fair, a great lunch spot. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to get here and there are other good Indian places in the area as well. If you live or work nearby as I do, definitely hit this place up. It's worth it."
2,"My table ordered a wide variety of things - tapas to full meals - and waited nearly two hours for our food. Before ordering we asked the waitresses opinion on a dish and she said something along the lines of ""yeah sure it's good."" When our food finally came out none of us were very happy with the wait, or the food. We mentioned this fact and while the kitchen staff was beyond nice and accommodating, trying to explain the situation, our waitress was annoyed and speaking quite rudely about us in German (which we understood)."
3,Pretty good gelato. I particularly recommend their sugarfree/glutenfree hazelnut flavor.
3,"I wasn't expecting to eat Portuguese in Germany, but when in Hamburg... Delicious Aioli. Chorizo had a wonderful smoked paprika bent to it. The gambas in garlic and olive oil was exactly how it sounds with the garlic having nice roasted notes. The good news is that it all goes down well with a local draft, or a glass of red. The atmosphere was charming and felt like a hectic, but warm family restaurant."
3,"Nice coffee shop if you are walking in this area in the mornings.  I must admit, a stopped in here a couple times from being out all night before and would grab a coffee to freshen my mind on the way to University, haha!  Yes, sometimes we would drink during the week and I would pull an all nighter around Grindelallee and would jump onto the U3 to go home and shower then head to University for classes.  Anyways, this coffee shop is next to the U3 exit/entrance depending which direction you are headed and I quite like their coffee to go, friendly service and assortment of pasties ranging from light flakey croissants to more sweet treats like something similar of a cheese Danish.  Croissants are delicious on a universal scale of consistency, you know what to expect, light, buttery, flakey, soft, fluffy and basically delicious calories.  However, sometimes I find cheesecakes or any cream cheese pastry in Europe not quite as sweet as in the US, probably because we really go HEAVY on the sugar, but their pastries here were the perfect mixture of sweetness :)The prices are fair and its additionally a nice Cafe to sit in the mornings with a paper.  It is also nice for a cake, they have lots of cakes here and all tasting very fresh, Mmmmm. Once I had something like a pumpkin/carrot cake with the creamiest frosting that I put in a to go bag but ended up eating it before I even made it to the UBahn entrance which is literally 1min walk outside the door, haha.... I really love Scandinavian themed coffee shops or bistros, when I first moved to Hamburg, I frequented many of these shops around the city."
4,"Miniatur Wunderland deserves its reputation. They make you travelling through different countries like the US, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria.. The details are fascinating and you won't have the time to get bored. How they conceive the cities is truly impressive and you will be immersed in this miniature world."
3,"A good, friendly Greek restaurant in Eimsbuettel. Have been well looked after by the staff there."
2,"A very standard place in Ottensen. Nice but nothing extraordinary. I am quite surprised at how often this place fills up. The food is average if that. The interior is about the same as 50 other places in Hamburg. The crowd is also your typical Ottensen hipster-wannabe. If in the area, stop in and grab some food but don't bring extensive expectations or foresee a memorable evening. Just a local place to grab food and beer."
2,whatever happens do not order the chuck steak! it is a piece of sh...flubber...or fat rubber...if you respect your stomach and want that organ to stay intact...get the sirloin instead. the sirloin was nicely cooked and tasted proper. The waiter was nice enough to refund my appetizer because i had to spit out the chuck steak into the plate....So for the good sirloin and the customer service..this place gets 3 stars for my taste....I really hope they remove the sub-par food from their menu.
3,"We came here for the 6-course house menu, which will keep you there for a very pleasant three hours.The food was good, rich, and portions sized to made sure you wouldn't leave hungry. All taken together, it was relatively heavy food without too many sides that I should probably not have eaten directly before heading home and going to bed... oh well...Loved some of their dishes - particularly the lamb chops - while others were just ok (e.g. the fried duck was overdone and not too refined). Overall, fair value for the price and a good experience if you want to sample some authentic Chinese cuisine while always staying on the 'safe side' for a Western palate."
4,Best breakfast in the center of Hamburg.Try the self baked buns - best buns in town!The scrambled egg is very yummy and you should definitely try it out!
4,"It's nice to see that these formally vacant wharehouses and been modernised and used as offices, studios and small businesses. Speicherstadt houses Hamburg Dungeons and the impressive indoor model railway. A short walk from Landungsbrucken or a bus ride from the city centre."
4,"This had to be one of the highlights of our trip. Take your time to look for all of the minute details! You'll not believe what you will see...a whole miniature world of people working, playing, beautiful scenic sights, city light...so much to see, the three hours we spent there allowed to really enjoy the work that's gone into the entire display!"
1,Bad service even for Germany. Not the best food either. If you want beer and to be ignored go here. If you are actually hungry.... good luck. The sampler platter is not very appealing. Just skip to the entrees and save your self the money.
3,"Starbucks is usually good. I've been to this one several times already and I like it, but I have a few remarks.The last time the guy didn't prepare what I ordered. It was a quite night, so there is no excuse. I preferred not to tell him about his mistake and just took the drink.Often there are no tissues or soap in the toilet. W.t.f., Starbucks in the heart of Hamburg!And something positive: I recommend the 1st floor seats by the window. There is a nice view, better than the one on the 2nd floor."
4,"A good little restaurant where you can either take away or consume inside. I am used to come the morning for their croissants or at lunch for their Schönes Grün salad which is based on quinoa, suave raspberry, beans, avocado and other green vegetables. The staff is very kind and fast, I recommend it very much!"
4,"Beatiful setting/atmosphere and the food was outstanding!  Just make sure you read German or go with someone who does because they do not have an English Menu and the Waiters did not speak much English.  The seafood, salads and desserts were not only incredible to look at but were equally incredible to eat. Highly recommend."
3,"Authentic Korean food. The service is just okay due to their overcrowded client volume. The food is nice. I'll recommend roast meat menu and their ""hot pot"" menu (it's actually kind of bigger version of soup). I have to say it is a bit pricy compared to the quality of food."
4,"I'm a big fan of Zum Spätzle - I've been here on both of my trips to Hamburg. Both visits were on Sunday afternoons (harder to find places that are open then in Neustadt).There are English menus present and the staff was totally fluent. Both times I was offered to walk through the menus and recommendations on what to order.Both times I ordered spätzle and a glass of wine. Both times I got delicious, cheesy goodness. This place is pretty small - just a couple of tables. I wouldn't be surprised if it's hard to find a seat here during peak hours."
3,"Part lobster and fish dealer, part seafood canteen - Hummer (lobster) Pedersen is an institution down in the commercial fish market area.Seating is casual and busy, service efficient; patrons at lunch are a mix of business people from the neighboring office buildings and tourists.Dishes are simple (think fried fish with potatoes; oysters with some shallots at the side; tuna tartare; plain cooked and opened lobster with hot butter at the side) and effective for it. Their wines are very well selected. All at not cheap, but very fair prices.Do yourself a favor and eat here rather than at the garage-style fish roll outlets up the street who will probably even serve their spiny lobster with crude mayonnaise and french fries at the same price..."
2,Not one of the most obvious or attractive restaurant fronts I have seen. And on this particular day I have to say that I dont agree with some of the other reviewers with regard to friendliness of the staff. But the food is good and genuinely Italian as is the atmosphere inside. I had a great Saltimbocca (always a good test!) and was waiting for The Godfather to turn up at any minute. Cuneo is easy to find from St Pauli U Bahn and I am sure I will return
4,"Very cozy place, somehow dark and homey in the evenings, with very nice and friendly staff!"
4,"Really authentic, I am a Chinese myself. I always come here, and the quality is good, quantity it's also fine."
3,Nice place for a no fuss no frills stop. Definitely a nice place to read and enjoy a cuppa. Their vanilla latte is heavenly.
4,"I absolutely love and recommend the location for a 'half-decadent' Friday lunch. Food is modern Vietnamese cuisine, the serving process is optimized and even when you see a long queue you will still be seated and served within less than 10 minutes. The staff is extremely friendly. It can be noisy and crowded at times but that's part of the experience too."
1,"We were walking around looking for somewhere for a quick snack and popped in to this cool looking restaurant. After ordering food and drinks we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. There where 5 other occupied tables and three waitresses but nothing seemed to happen. I started timing. Ten minutes after we ordered, we were told the drinks they would be with us shortly. They arrived five mins later with the food. (Quick tip: ALWAYS bring the drinks ASAP and ALWAYS before the food- that way it's more likely that a second drink will be ordered; thus making more money and maybe more tips.)The food however was good and the portions large but nothing out of this world. Cute inside. Quite highly priced but OK if you're not expecting much. Large terrace and a good place to ""be seen"" if thats what you're into.Wouldn't  recommend too highly."
3,"What a cool spot! Located right in the middle of bustling Schanze in Hamburg, this Currywurst and fries joint has a legit vibe going on. The food is really nice, so are the fries.Hip clientele and friendly staff. Really a no fuss no frills place, not fancy but so good. Apparently some guests did not have the best experience but I do not understand why. When it comes to this food, many place are bad, but this one had a high quality.Prices are also good, would recommend."
4,"My favorite bar in my favorite street of Hamburg, as they fit perfectly together. Both a mix of trashy & classy combined with a laid-back atmosphere and timeless interior. I really like the old gymnastics furniture, now function as sofas to sit down on..The big icebear in the corner is a pretty funny item too, as it doesnt fit into the context at all.. The coffee is delicious, already addicted to their caffee latte machiato. You can smell the homemade pastas at every corner of this cosy bar, which makes you crave for one..even when you not hungry. You order at the bar, which can be annoying when it gets crowded in the weekends, but it does create a peaceful moment when you dont have stressed staff coming up to your table asking you what else you would like...Yes, that may sound strange..but I experienced it in that sort of a way..Just do your own thing. The background music is divers but always good varying from electronic sounds in the weekends and funky jazz/lounge during the week. And if you dont feel like talking...there are tons of magazines to update your knowlegde about anything youd like..5 stars cause its a great picture all together!"
4,"The name is program! I have been here already twice this months and I have to say that the steaks are awesome. The Prime Cut Filet is very tender and definitely worths a try. Friends enjoyed the New York Strip and Rib Eye very much as well. Looking at the sides, I am recommending the leaf spinach and potatoes. Besides, they selection of wines is good. PS: not sure why other people write about cheese burger I haven't seen any on the menu!"
4,"I had a really enjoyable afternoon here at the weekend. I'd forgotten how fun zoos are, and took great delight in being able to feed the elephants apples, carrots, money - which they pass to their keepers, etc! There are lots of other animals, my highlights included: - weird hare/dog hybrid things- the petting zoo where you can get in with the goats- some turkeys- a horse 15 euros buys you a lot of happiness. Have a look at my photos!"
0,"Wir waren heute abend dort! Nach einem Versuch von vor 2 Monaten, mal wieder griechisch essen zu gehen. Nachdem wir uns hingetzt hatten, wurden zwei Karten mit den Worten Auch was essen? auf den Tisch gelegt. Wir haben dann ewig gesessen und darauf gewartet, dass jemand die Bestellung entgegen nimmt. Vergebens! Nach 15 Minuten sind wir dann aufstanden und gegangen. In diese Kommerz - Tempel war ich das letzte Mal. Schließlich haben wir dann zwei Straßen weiter in der Behringstraße die Taverna Sotiris gefunden - Ein Traum!"
4,"Very cute crepery with authentic, delicious crepes. Lovely place to sit and relax. Great artwork and decor on the walls, with paintings by French artists.  Staff/cook are all French. I got the buckwheat salmon and legumes savory crepe, and ""the delicious"" as the sweet crepe. Both were fantastic but I loved the sweet one more. The toasted almonds were a splendid touch.  Highly recommend this place!"
3,"I became a fan of Thai food last year on a stay in the US...since then I really love Thai food and - of course - this was the reason to look out for Thai restaurants while on a short trip to Hamburg.I found Sala Thai Hafencity while walking around this beautiful part of the city - and went in for lunch. First: The place looks super. Very clean, nicely decorated and a fantastic view! The food I had was very good - a soup and hot chili beef. The slightly sour soup was very different from many other soups I had in Thai places...And the beef was very delicious though VERY hot. I am really accustomed to eating hotter than most other people...but that was almost too hot. So watch out when the menu says ""hot""! Service was great. Never disturbing, always nice...just like it's supposed to be. And the price was absolutely fine for what I got (might be different in the evening, though). To sum up: When I'm in Hamburg again I will visit Sala Thai again. This is a place I can recommend without hesitating."
4,"A delightful, local restaurant for authentic German food. Both the schnitzel and the sausages were remarkable. Right on the water, the outdoor seating was delightful. Service was great. Highly recommended."
2,"Wonderful position on the Alster, very nicely arranged and designed. On other hand its quite expensive and waiters are unfriendly. I go there sometimes to bring our friends visiting Hamburg for first time because of nice location but the place is definetely not my favorit."
4,"Wow highly recommend this place! I would come back here next time I visit Hamburg because the food was absolutely delicious. I had asparagus and ricotta ravioli and it was absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge fan of asparagus but it's asparagus season right now so it was fresh and delicious. In addition the ravioli was hand made earlier and was extremely fresh and just melted in your mouth. Without a doubt some of, if not, the best ravioli I've ever had. Would highly recommend visiting here if in Hamburg (just make sure you go to the right one) and I plan to come back. Also as a note they had an English menu which was extremely helpful!"
0,"Germany big cities are trying to trend it up with Asian Fusion food everywhere but bare in mind in Northern part of Germany they dont neccessarily find Asians as Beautys.First off, I'm sad this is just another Western water down fast food joint where the quality is shit and everything is over salted and spicy portion dropped for the Scandinavian palate.I recommend for Authentic Vietnames, go to Green Papaya down the street.It's always packed and this is probably reason why others suck cause the Best is always packed and too popular."
3,"This is very personal restaurant with high ambitions and with good natural wines, which is a bit hard to find in Hamburg.Absolutely worth a visit!Great staff!"
3,A pretty nice place for beer and food and a great place to sit outside in summer.
4,"It's exactly the kind of place that you expect when you're looking for a cosy, crammed and delicious Italian restaurant. This place has great lunch deals.Make sure you make a reservation when you want to go there on a Saturday evening."
3,"We went to Witwenball for a special occasion dinner when some friends visited from out of town. Overall, the space is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is good. I think my only real complaint is that the pacing of the meal was extremely slow (for my taste)."
2,"Came here with work colleagues for something to eat.  As it was a nice day, we sat outside.  A casual arrangement on benches which means you may have to share a table with others but this is part of the atmosphere.  Of course the outside is probably more popular with the smokers so us non-smokers have to suffer the odd whiff of smoke in our direction.  A popular social area, there are street performers so if you are lucky you may get some live music as you dine.  Down side is that you can also get approached by beggars.Extensive menu of Japanese food from sushi, curries, noodles, rice dishes etc,  I think you would be hard pushed not to find something to eat.I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki which was nice if not a little too salty with a little too much sauce.  Nevertheless I ate it all.  My sushi loving companion loved their sushi dish.No pressure to move on once you have finished and so you can chill out with a beer after you have eaten also.Staff friendly (menus in German but then I didn't ask for an English one) and good value for money €65 for 4 of us with drinks and tip in that price."
4,"Great! I'm from California and this is my first time trying to eat Mexican food here. Not that it's so easy to find. I had the chorizo burrito and it's GIGANTIC! I just finished the rest of it for dinner. The chorizo is actually spicy, which surprised me, since it is Germany. haha. The people are really nice there. It's clean, not too expensive,but a little crowded at lunch. I will definitely go back and try all the other things. Es war toll! Ich komme aus Kalifornien und das war meine erste mal Mexicanessen zu probieren. Es ist ziemlich schwer zu finden. Ich habe den Chorizo Burrito bestellt und es ist RIESIG! Ich habe gerade die Reste für Abendessen gegessen. Die Chorizo ist scharf, es war eine Überraschung. haha. Die Leute sind sehr nett. Das Restaurant ist sauber, nicht so teuer, aber ein bisschen eng in die Mittagspause. Ich gehe gern zurück und wurde gern alle die andere Sachen probieren."
2,"From the very beginning, they had us standing out in the cold so they could try to sell pictures of us with axes. Considering the price we shoulda gotten the picture for free... lol It's a lot of acting and narrating in German, so if you don't speak german, a lot goes over your head. But some of the videos have english on the bottom however bring your reading glasses cuz its a bit small. overall i think they should consider english tours considering they have parts of their brochure in english... a lil misleading. so 3 stars only."
4,"The service is pretty slow (they are very understaffed), but the food is great. The scallop satay was really delicious. The chilli club salad was alright. The dressing was pretty fatty and the duck was fried. The chicken satay was pretty good, but also seemed a little unhealthy. The california rolls were very good. The red chicken curry wasn't so great. The sweet coconut curry with chicken was excellent and the chicken in it tasted fantastic with just salt and pepper.Even though the service was a little slow, our waitress was extremely friendly. I'd definitely recommend going here."
3,Fantastic spot for crepes. Very authentically French. Was here twice during my visit to Hamburg and always had a great experience. The menu offers many different options from traditional dishes to more modern ones. Great selection of desserts too. There's a store and a great outside area next to a canal. A must in Hamburg.
2,pretty good if you like ostrich meat - it's the theme of the restaurant (strauss is German for ostrich).
4,Awesome German fish restaurant (try Hamburger Krebssuppe) in old town Hamburg
2,"Pretty nice pub in Grindel to hang around and listen to the chatter of expats. I like going to theme pubs/restaurants and this one is pretty well executed (though doesn't top the Turm Bar's tiki experience or the Bond's 007 atmosphere). I ordered the Spud Chips (which for some reason my colleague assumed to be thick fries, turns out they were really just potato chips) which were very nice, but I only received my order after waiting close to 20-25mins and having to remind the waitress that I hadn't actually gotten anything. I'd love to come back here for a bit of something to nash over a glass of beer - but won't come here if hungry. Reading the rest of the reviews, looks like slow service is the Down Under default."
2,The service was good. The burgers were a bit too dense/ over cooked. It wasn't the best burger - just soso. The fries are very good though and the salad was nice.
3,"Was there once , quiet atmosphere, a bit lack of character considering  middle eastern  . The waiter was little bit serous face , could be more  welcoming , smily and energetic. However the service was good , food is good quality too  although small portions for big belly :) Small menu but they do well what they offer .Price suits to what other restaurants offer in same area ."
3,"Nice little, or actually rather big, corner café in this not too busy part of the city. I guess by nice little I mean relaxing, which Vesper is on the inside, but I wouldn't sit outside, not during rush hour at least. The owner and her staff are very attentive, interior design is ordinary yet charming somehow. The great thing about this place is its two modes, come evening it gets more restaurant-like. Coffee is good and the selection of draught beer is ample for a café."
3,"If you're in Ottensen at 5am and want to go to a lively bar, well, you don't have many choices. Familien Eck would be one though. Maybe one of the reasons is that it's pretty tiny, so it doesn't need that many people to be lively :) It's basically a dive bar, and a fair percentage of the crowd will probably be quite alternative/punky looking. Everyone is nice though, and the drinks are a reasonable price. One noteworthy thing is that to save space they have the DJ working almost on the ceiling! It's hard to describe, so you'll just have to see for yourself."
4,"Very good I had the big currywurst awsome a must visit while in Hamburg ,always packed"
4,"Hands down the best meal I had in Hamburg.  And the best Spatzle I've ever had!  The restaurant is so charming. It's locally run and serves traditional food from Swabia. There are so many exciting choices to choose from. My friend had a tofu spatzle and I elected for the special of the day which contained spinach, feta, and bacon.  The noodles are SO FRESH.  The service is delightful. All of the ingredients are locally sources and handmade. The portions are huge! I cried a tear knowing that I couldn't bring back the leftovers. The wine is also very good. PLEASE you must go here.  They are excellent!!!"
4,"I went there for breakfast and ordered a cappuccino and Hummus Bowl (Lime hummus, beetroot hummus, edible wildherb salad, beluga lentils, organic pached egg, sesame, pumpkin seeds, sunflowerseed & sourdough bread). The coffee was great and the food was simple and tasty (it was more tasty than I expected).They have outside tables and an upper floor. There are some tables next to the windows with a view over a canal. Nice interior overall. The waitress was nice too.It was a peaceful slow morning in this nice café. I will be back."
3,"Brought you the world by the same people as over in Peacestanbul, Mr Kebab is a friendly warm place for friends and colleagues to meet over a good hearty place of delicious mediterranean influenced food. Yes you can get the obligatory Döner kebab but they also have a range of specials to satisfy all tastes. Good for lunch, and fun / cool in the evenings. A nice place to go!"
1,"We tried seven different dim sum dishes but not only half of it was tasty and authentic. Some fried dumplings smelt already of (pork) fat when being served and didn't taste good either. Since we are regular in Hong Kong and Singapore, we know how it should taste. In addition, we were not amazed about the service either (actually fairly unfriendly, that's why I deduced another star).Nevertheless, we are 10.000km away from Hong Kong and authentic Chinese food is difficult to get: try the chicken feed at the Dim Sum house  they are really good and tasty!"
0,"That was the worst food poisoning for mussels I ever had in my life, almost survived! Do not recommend this kitchen at all."
3,"Kumpir is a little gem of a place on Schanzenstr. Basically they only sell baked potatoes, and the most expensive thing on the menu is EUR3.90, and that's what I went for. A mexican-themed baked potato. It came with cheese, chicken, salsa, nachos tomatoes and jalapenos. It really hit the spot. I'll definitely be back."
3,"Tasty place if you are looking for Vietnamese street food place. Simple but cozy interior. Friendly service, what else do you expect? Prices are very fair and the dishes are full of flavor."
3,Quaint little restaurant. Gets busy..make resvs'. All looks delicious. The home made cider is super yumm. They also have a clothing store in there.. They all look like fishermen.. Haha and like any good french place - it seriously smells like butter! Enjoy!
4,"Mr Kebab has another follower! This place seems to function as a hybrid of a proper restaurant and a fast food joint, and they've succeeded in keeping the best of both worlds. Fast service, cheap, but top quality food in pleasant surroundings, and unlike most kebab places I've known they also serve beer and other alcoholic beverages. The menu is extensive and portions are generous. I ordered the Iskender Kebab, a bowl of meat - wonderfully tender and juicy - and bread covered (entirely) in garlic yoghurt. Delicious."
4,"You know, I really didn't know that Hamburg is a Hamburger place so when we randomly googled and found this out, I knew I had to find a solid burger to enjoy while I was here! A quick yelp search brings up this place which was close to my hostel in Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and boy did the yelpers NOT disappoint! Unfortunately the infamous Lumper Jack wasn't on the menu but there's a ton of other options available. We came around 17:00 and it was empty--we almost hesitated going in but in the end, we were tired, hungry, and put all our trust in good reviews.My friend initially really wanted NOT a burger so if you're going for something besides a burger, they have like chicken fingers, a salad (yes, just one) and fish and chips. Also, if you're a vegetarian, there's a bunch of solid options on that end too. I couldn't decide from the loads of options, everything sounded amazing but in the end, I splurged for the Truffle Burger (7,90€)  and added an extra side of bacon (+1€). I also made it a meal by adding fries and a drink (3,90€ - choice of bottled beverages from waters to sodas to juices/lemonades to beer). My friend ended up getting the jalapeno burger (6,90€ i think?) with the meal as well.Our food came out pretty quickly and it was HUGE and honestly looked so delicious I barely got the plate and already started stuffing my face. I didn't even realize that they forgot the bacon at first until my friend realized they forgot to add it to hers too so we mentioned it and the chefs added it to the burgers. Holy moly, this burger is banging. The brioche bun has almost a pretzel-y flavor, almost smokey or whatever it is that makes pretzels get that rich brown colour. The burger was cooked a perfect medium (though I usually go for rare) and it was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The fillings were fresh, though the truffle flavor wasn't super present--the bacon really added another dimension of smokiness and honestly it was so good I had a hard time putting it down. The fries were really good too! Crispy but tons of solid potato flavor. When we paid, they asked if we wanted ketchup or mayonnaise but I wasn't sure if it was extra and decided against it. The fries honestly didn't need any sauce but if you want something additional, they do have choluha (reg, green, chipotle) and oil/vinegar. The beer was also very refreshing, and produced in hamburg which was pretty nice!The place is a order @ the counter, buzzer, seat yourself kind of place and is super clean with really nice bathrooms. The staff was really friendly and honestly, this place really was a winner! I don't know what people are talking about in terms of sports bar (?) but it just felt like a nice casual burger place. Definitely recommend!! So good and so glad I stopped in :)"
3,"I'm not from Hamburg, but it seems to be a cool coffee house, with reasonable prices! Our couchsurfer took us there, and he knows the people running this joint. I took a red tea which was good. The Sunday brunch seems tasty and diverse. Since I am a vegan, I didn't find much to eat there, therefore didn't order it. I would be happy to see some more vegetables and maybe avocado or something that us vegan can eat."
4,"Delicious food, generous portions, friendly staff in cool atmosphere. What's not to like? Can't wait to go there again."
2,"It was Saturday and both having full blow hangovers and in need of some serious carbs, meat, grease and salt to soak up some of that seedy feeling we set out to find Jim block.My friend being from the US and eager to have a good burger something which he had not had since being in Hamburg. After 3 hours of trying to find it and a parking space in the very crowded centre of Hamburg we finally made it to our destination.I must admit I expected a little more from the burgers... huge in size yes and the service was quick and the place has a nice feel to it but other then that I can't say that the burgers were all that great. I personally feel the one I had at Hollywood canteen was much better... Still there are more burgers to try on the menu and maybe it was just the one I ordered and it definitely beats MacDonald's and even Hesburger which you all know I'm rather fond of after a night out."
4,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and wanted to eat some decent Italian food before the flight. To get here we had to walk 30 minutes, and the weather outside was cold. However, all effort paid back when we got there.First the ambiance - it is a beautiful small restaurant, was not crowded that evening. They are dog-friendly, so they let us in with the dog, gave her some water, and let is pick the table we wanted.Now comes central part - food. We'be ordered pasta with cheese and ham. They clocked it very fast, and as the kitchen was nearby, the smell was impressive and stunning. When they brought us the dishes, pasta was hot, and the sauce was still boiling, this cheesy flavor that burns your mouth a bit but still tastes so delicious. Should I say that after that dinner we both were full and happily walked back to the hotel for 30 minutes!? Highly recommended, even if you need to put some effort to get there."
4,My two kids loved the joy of ordering on a tablet and swiping the meal themselves! Good food and good atmosphere. Will be back this week.
2,"Jimmy Elsass is supposedly the number one location to satisfy one's Tarte Flambée cravings in Hamburg. After having heard of this almost legendary venue for years I finally got around to actually visiting it - and was just a wee bit underwhelmed. The interior is decorated in typical students pub style (which is supposed to be no distinct style at all) - lime green walls, old fashioned seats, dim lighting and oversized plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling (and hence obstructing the way for taller guests). Some might find it charming and genuine, I however wouldn't mind a bit more polish here and there, especially as prices aren't exactly cheap. And this leads me to my main criticism: Tarte Flambée is an exceptionally cheap dish to produce, which is why I find a price range starting from six Euros a bit overconfident. That isn't to say the actual taste wasn't good, because it was - the base was crispy and light, though it could have done with more generous topping (and maybe more hearty bacon). But I generally don't like it when a restaurant's profit margins are as obvious as is the case at Jimmy Elsass'. The dessert menu also offers a sweet Tarte Flambée with apple and almonds ""flambé-ed"" with Calvados. It sounded intriguing, but actually wasn't all that nice, as the alcohol's taste was a bit too dominant and made the Tarte's base very soggy indeed. I'd avoid it in the future. Which isn't something I'd say of Jimmy Elsass in general - the place's got a focused menu with decent, if overpriced offerings. I just won't go out of my way to get there in the future and will definitely try the competition, as well."
3,This is a really nice restaurant! Really relaxing and enjoyable. I ordered a sandwich with pesto and it was really good!
4,This place was humming on a Wednesday night. Luckily we had made reservations. Parking in the area was a nightmare. Better use public transportation. But it was worse it. We did had to wait some time to get the attention of the waiter. Staff was nice and courteous. Will definitely come again.
3,"The Turmbar looks quite harmless from the outside, but from the inside, a spiral staircase (minus the stairs!) will take you in circles what seems to be forever until you arrive at the bar at the top. The Turmbar is actually divided into two bars - a small one at the bottom and a larger at the top. I hadn't actually been to the top bar but spent an entire evening in the odd Inca-themed bar at the bottom, which reminded me of a bar I had visited in Disneyworld. Don't worry - even if you decide to party at the bar on the bottom floor, you'll end up having to go on up the spiral, since that's where the toilets are. Recommended for the adventurous and those who are looking for a light evening - you're probably NOT going to want to go up that spiral while plastered."
3,Really good restaurant. Highly recommend it! Please try the fried potatoes that comes with spring onions and bacon... spectacular!
2,"Started out with the pork+prawn spring rolls, very tasty, although oily. Tried the beef and chicken pho. The broth was ok, but had to add some Sriracha for a bit more flavor. The lemonades (traditional and raspberry) were nice presented and refreshing! Small space inside with tables close to each other, a wall covered with pictures from Vietnam and music playing in the background. The staff was very friendly, the food came quick, even though it was crowded. Wouldn't come back for the pho, but would definitely try more items from the menu."
3,"The last weekend me and a friend of mine were looking for nice icecream. So we decided to go to Eiszeit.Obviously the shop was full of hungry people who were waiting in a long row (50feet).After 10min of waiting, we had the choice of many interesting varieties like ""the ball"" ,which is the icecream of Rocher. yummie! The price per scoop is not that cheap (about 90 cents), but its worth it !"
4,Fantastic food at affordable prices in a quick and efficient way. It doesn't get a any better than this for a lunch break.. Oh did I mention there's a great outside area? There is!I had one of the best bolognese pasta dishes here of my life. Yeah. And I didn't had to wait for it I just ordered it quickly and enjoy it. Good selection of local drinks and sodas.Great to eat outside on a sunny and beautiful summer day.
3,"Really good pizza. Too big to finish! Free Sambucha shots with the receipt, nice touch. Free bubbly while you wait for a table too. Watch out though, they pour you San Pelegrino water without asking, of you drink it, €5 added to your cheque. A very nice experience overall and a tasty lunch the next day ;)"
3,"Solid Ethiopian place in a relatively quiet part of Ottensen. A few tables indoors, and the rest spilling out onto the sidewalk. The food is pretty tasty, but the host is the real draw. He's super-friendly, welcoming, and also speaks English pretty well.The menu is short and simple: a three-course Ethiopian menu with the option of a vegetarian or non-vegetarian platter. The main course is a platter of injera (spongy Ethiopian flat bread) topped with various stewed dishes: spinach, potatoes and cabbage, beets, chickpeas, lentils. If you order non-vegetarian, you get a chicken drumstick dish as well. The dessert was a quite good chocolate cake and a small cup of Ethiopian coffee. Despite having wine in the restaurant's name, I was surprised at how few wine options were available on the menu. That said, I had a glass of Riesling that went nicely with the meal.The only reason I'm giving four stars (and not five) is that I found the prices to be too high. Maybe I'm used to paying very little for Ethiopian food in the US, but the prix-fixe dinner surprised me at 21 Euro. It's the only Ethiopian restaurant I've visited in Hamburg, so maybe that gives them license to charge whatever they want."
4,"This place is the shiznet! It's loungy and bar-like, yet good enough to bring your kids along. We did indeed bring our boys here. The waitress/bartender was awesome and spoke very English very well.  Th food - Turkish style middle eastern was great. Kids had a burger and falafel. Wife and I had Doner(Gyro basically). All that and drinks for the kids and 5 drinks for us(yeah kids drove ya crazy today - don't judge) - $55 Euros. I overtipped the waitress because the kids were being little twerps, over tired from a long day. She really did a fantastic job though."
4,"After trying few different flammkuchen in Hamburg, I would say this is the best in town. It's a cosy place, located in a hidden corner near Schlump station. The staff is very friendly, they gave me explanations and some good recommendations . We tried flammkuchens with dates and with salmon. Both tastes awesome. The crust is thin and crispy. Topping combinations are good. A warm Jimmy herbal tea is healthy and tasty. For dessert, we tried Creme Brûlée which is only available in winter. It was not bad but there is still some rooms for improvement."
3,"I actually got lost looking for this place. I'm a damn tourist that doesn't know how to read street signs, let alone have a sense of direction whatsoever. A bartender recommended Oma's but we misunderstood what he said so we walked around in circles until we found it. The place was packed even on a weeknight so we knew it was good.The food is surprisingly good and cheap too. I ordered the schnitzel with bacon. Everything is good with bacon! It came with potatoes and lots of bacon. It was quality food for under €10. You should come here with a big appetite because the Germans are known for serving huge portions."
2,Das Essen hier ist wirklich lecker. Pakistanisch und Indisch sind nicht besonders unterschiedlich. Beim Mittagstisch gebennsie sich allerdings nicht die allergrößte Mühe. Schmeckt trotzdem immernoch gut. Die Bedienung ist mal so mal so. Gehe hier aber dennoch gern hin.
4,"Roth is a great little cosy pub/restaurant. However, if I'm honest I've never eaten here, so I'm just reviewing it as a pub. They have Rothaus Tannenzäpfle on tap, along with quite a few Irish beers, including Guiness and Murphys, so they have the beer pretty much nailed. The staff are friendly enough, and because of the restaurant side of things you get table service for your beer, which is nice. I'll have to try the food sometime"
2,Very big and quite impressive but once you've seen one section you've pretty much seen it all.
3,"""Create you own salad"" places are really hard to find in Europe and look no further people because this is one of them! So excited to be able to build my own salad. You pick a base four toppings and a protein. The salads come with a slice of bread and I found the small salad to be quite filling. The mint tougher dressing was really tasty and refreshing so I definitely recommend it. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating and not very crowded for lunch!"
2,"Update: I have to take this place down a notch. They are now vegetarian and everything which used to include meat now has some kind of tofu replacement or isn't on the menu anymore. This definitely takes them down a notch when it comes to many breakfast options.....bacon.....you can't take away bacon folks! It's a god-given right!Had breakfast here this morning with a friend and business partner and came away pleasantly surprised. There have been a lot of comments all over the place both on Yelp and Qype about this place. I had been at ""Don't Tell Mama"" in their previous location and really liked the cheesecake but service sucked and the location was a hassle for me. Had meant to come here forever but finally had the chance. I am finnicky about breakfast and very few places in Hamburg do it right. Mamalicious did a pretty good job. The eggs benedict were quite good as was a 3-egg scramble (with dried tomatoes and feta cheese). Coffee was tasty too. I had a fruit smoothie which was so so but I think it was more the mix of fruit verses anything else that didn't let it shine. All in all a nice location with outdoor seating as well (does get loud due to busy street right there). Service was really nice but we were first ones in the door in the morning and it wasn't that busy. Unfortunately, hash browns were out. No idea how something is already out right at opening and found this a bit odd but so be it. All in all we were happy with breakfast and enjoyed the place. I plan on coming back and hope not to find all the gripes which have been mentioned: too loud music, slow service nor missing food items, etc. This place is good but could very easily tip over to mediocre. As long as you get good service and they have everything available you should be happy with this place. Prices are a bit steep too but hopefully you're getting quality for that and they do use organic products (or so they say) and mention having a local, quality butcher for their meat. Let's hope that the second visit is just as good if not better."
4,"Great sushi! The place is just like the main restaurant, great people, best sushi place for lunch in town. Good parking. Tasty."
4,"At monday late lunchtime interesting beverages  price okay. Don't forget to look at the blackboard. Chicken and summer rolls good quality and tasty. Very nice service , created special meal for our little one. If you want to sit outside space is limited and during lunchtime expect to wait."
3,"A very cool concept for good food in a really great location but with a slightly fast food twist. Va piano promises a great social location with great pizza and pasta to choose from, made freshly in front of you. My friend had the tortollini pesto pasta which was really well presented and tasted excellent. I had the calzone pizza which by nature took longer to cook yet was well worth the wait. This was one of the nicest calzone pizzas I have had in my life. A great chain with a great idea, if you are I'm the area stop looking for other places right now."
3,"Spacious, and has leash free dog areas - always fun.  Both shady and sunny areas - I take my dog there almost every Sunday."
4,"SOOOOOO good! Cheap, amazing food and friendly service!"
3,Such a sweet little cafe with awesome cakes. But the vegan range was quite small unfortunately. The mint and ginger tea was great anyway :) thanks for having us !
3,Brüdigams combines  an interesting and relaxing atmosphere with quality food. Our waiter was really helpful and we ended up enjoying delicious wild boar with a delightful Bulgarian red wine. All and all the experience was great and good value for money. Would visit again.
4,"This bar seems little on the outside, but turns out to be pretty big on the inside. Besides the two regular rooms with cute tables and picknick chairs, theres another room in the back, just as big, great in case it gets crowded. The sunday breakfast buffet is probably the best Ive seen since living in Hamburg. Everything you can think of having for breakfast, big chance they offer it in here! And, last but not least, its affordable! I definitely will come back here, as my friends also recommend this place during the week, on every day evenings. Great to grab a bite, coffee, breakfast or relaxing afternoon!"
4,"Miniatur Wunderland markets itself as the world's largest model train exhibit, but it's a lot more than that. This place is incredible; all of the hype is absolutely justified.I don't want to spoil the experience for you (exactly the same words my coworker told me when she recommended Miniatur Wunderland, which I now completely understand), so I'll just give you a few tips for ensuring a great experience:1. You can and should make a reservation online before you visit. It's a little weird because you don't actually need to pay for this reservation; it's just some kind of ticketing system to control flow.2. If you're visiting on a weekend or a holiday, plan to go as early as possible, like between 8:30-9:30am. The place starts filling up with visitors around 10am and the experience is way better when it's empty and you have the place to yourself.3. The entrance is on the 2nd floor and there are lockers available for stowing your backpacks (1euro deposit). Take the elevator to the 3rd or 4th floors where the exhibits are. I was really concerned about ""where to start"" but in the end it really doesn't matter. You'll be impressed no matter what order you see everything in.4. There are buttons on the railing throughout the exhibits, which activate various details in the scene. Press ALL the buttons! (But really, some of them are quite delightful and you don't want to miss out.)5. Plan to stay for 2-3 hours...at least!If you find yourself in Hamburg you need to visit, for the child inside you. Miniatur Wunderland will bring out the wonder and excitement of the child you used to be."
2,"Fun, airy, Moderate.  Told myself I didn't go to Germany to eat Italian, much less at a chain, but after several days of never seen anything remotely green on my plate (ubiquitous potato, one restaurant served me two side dishes of potatoes prepared differently), i needed the vegetables.  DH got roasted vegetables on his pizza, I decided on a spinach pesto pizza.  Slices of heaven.  Salty, though.  Did you know heaven was high in sodium?  Drank a gallon of water, but water is good for you.You go station to station.  Pay at the end, it's added to this card you are given upon entering.Very brightly lit.  Communal tables, but no one talks to each other.  Often crowded.  Potted basil and rosemary plants on the tables."
3,I had the fit plate. It was very nice... They have a great pepper sauce.
4,"Great food! the menu is quite extensive, very authentic, nice staff who help you if you're a korean bbq newbie :) good prices for the amount of food you get, all in all a must visit if you're looking for good korean food :)"
4,"By far the best Irish Pub I've visited in Germany so far. The owner is from Dublin, half of the staff is also Irish native. Great pint of Guinness (or as they'd call it ""Perfect Pint""), great atmosphere. Make sure to try the burgers and baguettes, order Guinness and best drop in on a Thursday for the weekly pub quiz (not during the summer) or on a Friday / Saturday for the craic. Also worth mentioning: probably the largest collection of Irish whiskeys I've seen in a pub so far. However, no other than Irish whiskey is served."
3,This restaurant/bar is right at the end of the Reeperbahn. Its large and had some interesting interior decorations. Definitely worth looking into it.The food was yummy and the beer was tasty. Thats what we needed after a long walk through hamburg. Thanks guys.
1,"Solid drinks, a bit overpriced though. Ambiance is generic / OK, you could smell the toilets inside the bar. It's not living up to its hype. Staff is not very attentive."
4,The best place to stay in Hamburg when the sun is shining. I love it
3,"Having no prior knowledge of this place, therefore no preconceived ideas, I'd say it was delightful.  A nice glass of wine with an Alsacian onion tart and I was one happy gal.   A pleasant enough place with decent service and a comfortable atmosphere."
1,"The service is friendly but extremely slow. Waited 40min for an order that arrived incomplete. The quality is ok, but the food is overpriced. If you have time, patience and no other choice go for it, otherwise I would skip."
3,"Potato everything, even menus shaped like smiling potatoes. Food was pretty good, standard German fare. Portions generous and prices quite reasonable. One of the more expensive entrees plus a beer cost under 20 euros. Dark and cosy ambience (Keller means cellar, so most of the restaurant is, you guessed it, in a cellar.)"
4,Very good Mexican cuisine. Portions are large and the food is authentic! Definitely recommend it.
4,"We were visiting Hamburg for the day and found this coffee shop / cafe on Yelp. What a find!  It reminded me of the fabulous shops in San Francisco. Great hip, minimalist decor. The coffee and food was amazing!  I had a latte that was delicious and hit the spot since we were exploring in the rain. Their breakfast menu was small but fabulous. The staff was helpful and spoke English...yay. We ordered 3 different things--waffle with fruit and mascarpone (so good), poached eggs with avocado, and scrambled eggs with a delish cheese spread for toasted bread.  Everything was fabulous!  Definitely worth a stop!"
4,Geile Location - super Essen! Ich habe noch nie so ein perfektes Rinderfilet mit Scampis (Surf & Turf) gegessen!    Extremst empfehlenswert!
1,"The beer is good. The service was poor / spotty. I think they prefer their local crowd who will be there. Not child friendly at night, though they have a kids menu."
2,"Soup (mizo) and sushi were OK, but I wouldn't necessarily come back for them.Service was sparse, staff was friendly but not paying much attention. Asked for extra rice but never got it."
4,enchiladas de mole are amazing !
2,"Noah's is a nice enough little restaurant on Grosse Neumarkt, but it didn't seem special when I visited last night. When we went inside it was noticeable that we were the only guests there - Admittedly it was a Monday night, but still. The menu is small, which is fine, but the prices are quite a bit higher than the only other greek restaurant that I've been to in Hamburg, and sadly the food is worse On the up-side they're not too far from where I work and they have a competitively priced lunch menu, so I'll probably come back and try that sometime."
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this yet. When I arrived in Hamburg I heard much about the history of Absinth bar, but wasn't able to go there as it had just shut down. However, daily I saw the guy trekking through the streets of Hamburg covered in brickdust, on the 1.5 year epic to refit the place. It was definitely worth it. Very very chic. Tasteful furniture and a minimalist wrought iron and glass bar. Cool. And they play jazz in here. Well, actually, of course they place jazz in here. It's cool. Like 60s cool. Old school cool. This is one of the best bars in Hamburg, so make sure you drop by. And don't drink anything other than absinth. One of the dev team disgraced themselves having a soft drink. Shocker."
4,This is definetely my favorite place for coffee. It's tiny so sometimes I have to do take away but coffee is first class. Usually when I drink coffee I have this funny problem after where I feel quite tired after few hours. With Peaberries coffee I never felt anything like that. My wife told me this has to something with a way how coffee is roasted.
4,"Can't recommend this place enough. I lived my whole life in Bavaria but had to move to Hamburg to finally get some real handmade quality Spätzle again! In Augsburg, where I come from, it's gotten pretty hard to get good old fashion Käsespätzle because a lot of places turned into tourist-traps.Zum Spätzle is a very small and cozy place. It was cold outside so the warm and humid atmosphere inside was extra cozy. And with the smell of Käsespätzle in the Air I felt like visiting my grandmas ""gute Stube"". Everything is locally sourced and hand made. Especially the information about the Eggs coming from a farm where the male chicks are not killed was very valuable to me. There are dishes for vegetarians and vegans as well. So chose your Spätzle with Meatloaf or Tofu. I have not tried the Maultaschen, yet. But I sure want to do that someday.Both times I ate there I had a Spätzle dish. First time Käsespätzle with Meatloaf and brown onions was like my dream. Although I prefer my Meatloaf a bit more on the chunky side. This was almost too smooth. But everything tasted flawless, perfect balance of Spätzle and Cheese, the Gravy was to die for. Second time I had Käsespätzle ""pure"". What can I say, I love them. High quality for reasonable prices and you can get a free Spätzle-refill If you're not stuffed yet. Which you will want but can't manage to eat.Service is nice and chilled and asks for dessert & coffee in the best way without being pushy. Which is a quality I like very much. Lastly the place is so cosy with lots of pillows, natural wood, warm light and the smell of my childhood. At my grandmas or at a small cottage-restaurant were my parents used to take us to eat after we went hiking at the Alps. I recommend making a reservation if you want to eat there in the evening. I got lucky both of the times I went there. But I will visit again and again and I can not recommend enough to go and try it. Even If you are a tourist from Bavaria! Go and get some good Spätzle again!"
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Sagner's, and tried the northern German specialty labskaus.  The restaurants was a short walk from my hotel, and also was totally local. Luckily they had English menus, and the hostess was quite helpful and could speak English. I also sipped on a tasty local beer. Well priced also."
3,"Wonderful place with many locals.One of best places at ""Schaze"". Meet youg and ""older"" generation. Weekends nights are getting very busy at this place.Perfect party spot.I had some GinTonic and enjoyed my time there.Service was OK."
2,"I went to this coffee shop yesterday super excited after I saw their amazing tools( grinder, aero press, roasting their own beans etc.). I assumed it would be an amazing coffee shop and even brought my sister and boyfriend to show them the great location I found while visiting Hamburg. When we went to order our coffees I learned that they don't carry any non dairy milk which disappointed me a lot. Seeing vegan food options on the menu made me believe they for sure would carry non dairy milk but I was wrong. I passed on my coffee order after making the barrister aware I can't have milk and was offered a chai latte or tea. Button line is...carrying vegan food options but no non dairy milk was pretty disappointing to me."
1,"This place was quite an unpleasant surprise. Although we had passed by it often, living quite nearby, we hadn't tried it out. On a sunny day, we saw seats outside and decided to try it out for lunch. We had some wine, a pizza and noodles with gorgonzola and bacon. First and foremost, the prices here are a joke. I live in the area so I know it's not cheap around here. At the same time, the prices here are higher than everywhere around and the portions are smaller. The pizza is a decent size but they forgot one of the ingredients. Further, it was thin-crust but mushy and wet. Nothing crunchy or appealing about this dish. The noodles were bland and I think I counted about 15 pieces (in total) of penne. This as a main course and for something like 12 Euros. The pizza for somewhere in the vicinity of 15 Euro for the ""large"" was ridiculous. The wine, also not cheap, was OK but nothing more. Finally, service was a joke. Slow is an understatement. Disinterested and unprofessional fits the bill.So, why two stars? Well, I really like the decor inside. It is well styled. Further, it's a nice location and if you are only coming in for a couple glasses of wine, fine. I'll give them two stars for deco and location. Otherwise, everything else is a joke.Finally, you better like snobs. The place is usually full of your usual Eppendorfer clowns. Pinks, greens, animal prints, silicon lips, LV bags and so forth. I can usually drown them out and mostly find them amusing decoration for a place. They entertain me well but I know enough people who would gag at their sight and here you don't have to wait long for the ""show"" to begin."
4,"Perfekt! Essen, Preis-Leistung, Ambiente  eine echte Bereicherung für Hoheluft."
3,"Cool student bar in the Grindel that actually has more going on than meets the eye. Inside theyve got a foosball table and a back room where theyve got jazz on Wednesday nights, show Tatort on Sunday nights, and host other smaller concerts as well. The furniture is a nice living room style hodge podge set up, the people that hang out are friendly and so are the folks that work here. Drinks are well priced and theyve got a good selection of tea as well. Soft pretzels are a nice touch when you want something salty to go along with your beer. Some nights they have a DJ as well spinning some of his favorite vinyl. By day a great place to read or play chess and by night a great place to have a drink with friends and chat up the others hanging out."
3,"Kebap shop with a  much wider menu than just kebaps. Great outdoor seating with lots of sun; on a sunny day. Additionally, they give you a free salad and bread with your order. I don't know how the kebaps are but I got a dish consisting of lamb, a yoghurt sauce and little chunks of bread, topped with a pretty hot chili. Absolutely delicious. The yoghurt was just adequate to balance the powerful flavour of the lamb. The food also gets prepped very quickly. Definitely a fan of this place for a quick bite"
2,Great space; pieces are great including the two Lagerfeld dresses when you enter the museum.  I found an elevator but I don't think it was listed on the map.Restaurant wasn't too bad and the price was great.  The museum store is pretty much what you'd find in any other museum.
3,"Knuth is a lovely and over-popular cafe in central Altona. Be prepared to wait around for at least 10 minutes before getting a table if you show up mid-morning on the weekend for breakfast. The menu is relatively simple. All the standard German breakfast options based around bread, cheese, meat, fruit and eggs are here. Nicely put together with quality ingredients and at a reasonable price. I like Knuth, but it does get a bit full of young parents..."
3,I love Campus Suite franchise. after the Balzac this is my favorite place to hangout in the morning. Campus have really low prices and quite good snacks which are even better than Balzac's. Lots of stuff for Bio & Eco lovers.
3,My boyfriend LOVES Liebling eis' ice cream. it's goodnot A LOOOT of choice but good enough.It's yummy but still not my favorite ice cream shop in hamburg!
3,"Good coffee,  sandwiches,  and yogurts close to Marriott Hotel and much better value. Plenty of space and friendly staff."
0,"The Viale Antico was a nice little Italian place that we used to frequent on a regular basis. Unfortunately due to multiple circumstances I'm now re-classifying it as a 1 star restaurant. It may well be a victim of it's own success. They've got a lot more customers now, but no more staff. In fact they have less staff, and they've put the prices up! The waiters are generally incompetent. Today we were seven people. The first two meals came, then we waited 5 minutes for the next two. We had to wait a further 20 minutes for the last three, while repeating our order for three separate waiters. When the last three were finally ready they were sitting on the counter for a few minutes with no-one to bring them over, so one of the chefs motioned to us that we should just pick them up ourselves If this was the first time that I'd had such a bad experience I'd let it pass, but they were almost as bad the last time (1 month ago). I just can't let it pass. The food is still decent, but it's definitely not worth the experience that comes with it."
3,"It's not the most intimate or convivial décor - it's very ""hotel-y"".The staff are extremely attentive and helpful.Absolutely excellent gin and tonics, and their bar has an impressive selection.The burgers are some of the best I've had so far in Germany (...not as good as a *really good* burger in America, but very tasty) and the allumette (""matchstick"") fries are a little crispy, salty, delicious cone-full of heaven. Can't wait to try their selection of various proteins tartare (next time!). It's pricey - good for a treat.Edit:  I've had the steaks here once or twice now, too. The meat is high quality, but drastically suffers from typical German under-seasoning. I'd stick with the burgers."
2,"After eating here twice and the restaurant next door (Falafelstern) twice, I'm not impressed by the taste of the food at Kimo, so I'd definitely recommend going next door for falafel instead. I've ordered the large falalplatter here twice, which for 5.50 euro comes with a large variety and decent quantity of food. The falafel is decent tasting, and five balls are included. There's also a basket provided with a few pieces of flat pita.Kimo does have more choices and a less fast-food feeling, but I'd still go to Falafelstern hands-down because I find the falafel and other ingredients much tastier."
4,"Possibly the best Irish pub I've been in outside of Ireland. As the host Aiden says, It's 60 square metres of Dublin in Hamburg. Great Guinness, great food, live music, a quiz and even live theatre  it's all done to a very high standard by friendly staff. I've had a lot of fun there and you will too. Slainté."
4,"An outstanding restaurant! The food was excellent, and the staff's hospitality made for a truly memorable evening. The owner, Franco, clearly loves feeding people and interacting with customers, and the whole restaurant was filled with a great energy. In addition to the great food, the service is what makes this place really shine. I visited this restaurant while traveling alone in Hamburg, and I felt right at home here. I had only the first two courses of the four-course menu (plus dessert and a fancy shot!), and everything was superb - some of the best seafood I've ever eaten! I would have gone for the other courses had I not been so full :) If you are looking for good seafood and a fun, intimate experience in Hamburg, look no further. This place is amazing."
2,Sushi was alright. Staff wasn't directly rude but it felt uncomfortable. On top of that it is very busy and very very loud. Not suited for a relaxed dinner with friends.
3,I had the vegan pancakes called Roxen. It was served with fruits and apple puree. The portion was really huge. Next to that I ordered a lactose free cappuccino with oat milk. I was only able to eat one of the twopancakes. The pancakes could be a little bit sweeter. The atmosphere is cozy and hip. The service was good and friendly.
2,"The Neustädter Grill Meier is a no frills German fast food joint in the Wexstrasse, frequently visited by office workers in the area. It has all the usual menu items you will find at any other German Imbiss like Bratwurst (grilled sausage), Currywurst (sausage in a sweet, curry-spiced ketchupy sauce), Schnitzel, fries, Halbes Hähnchen (1/2 roasted chicken), potato salad but also other meals such as goulash with mashed potatoes. I mostly opt for the large Currywurst with Fries. Even though the sausage is not grilled (since this place doesn't have grill, everything is deep fried) it's good and the sauce (not self-made) also does it's work. Fries come in a well-sized portion and are hot and crisp. Those of you who want a no frills German Imbiss with acceptable prices should spend their lunch here. Unfortunately this place is closed on weekends, so I have to find another joint to satisfy my rare Imbiss cravings"
2,"Hier habe ich öfter ein kleines Frühstück genossen oder auf die schnelle ein Kaffee. Jedes Mal fand ich die Bedienung SEHR freundlich und hilfsbereit, das Essen schmeckte, und die Einrichtung finde ich nett und atmosphärisch. Leider habe ich heute die Minestrone bestellt.Die Suppe war dünn, und hell Braun mit kleine, oben-schwimmende Fettaugen. Grundsätzlich habe ich nichts gegen Fettaugen, wenn sie zum Geschmack beitragen. Nur diese Brühe hatte leider keinen Geschmack. Die bunten Zucchini Würfeln und sehr wenige Bohnen und Weißkohl Streifen konnten alleine die Braune Brühe nicht zum Leben erwachen. Knoblauch?  Fehlanzeige, Pfeffer?  Fehlanzeige, Salz?  usw. Seltsam finde ich es, dass die Brühe Braun war, und scheinbar nichts (Geschmacklich) mit dem Gemüse zu tun hatte.Nein, ich habe mich nicht Vorort beschwert aus dem einfachen Grund, dass ich wenig Zeit hatte und gar keine Lust hatte auf ein Grundsatzdiskussion über der Definition von Minestrone, und verschiede kulinarische Interpretationen davon.Das Erlebnis heute war enttäuschend. Ich hoffe, dass Engelke beim nächsten Besuch besseres zu bieten hat."
4,"Everything was authentic- the service, food and atmosphere! Would highly recommend. We got both the tikka masala and butter chicken, which were cooked perfectly"
3,The food quality is good. kebab is authentic.servers could do a better job.
4,"What a great spot!!Super atmosphere! Cool people.Great, yummy and sustainable sourced coffee.The waffles were my favorite :)"
4,"Some of the best, nicest barkeepers I've ever seen.Great selection of American whiskeys, will convert the most ardent scotch lover."
4,"Loved absolutely everything about this place! It's so romantic and cosy, great friendly service, perfect atmosphere and delicious food, desserts and coffee!"
4,"My visit to Herr Max without a doubt was one of my Hamburg highlights. Friendly staff, ok prices, easy to find, great cakes and an extremely cool interior.It's hard to name Herr Max's style, but I guess I'd go for something like 'classic abandoned' or 'a long-forgotten castle', but all without making it a dirty or uncomfortable place. Absolutely not. I felt very welcome, and actually didn't notice most of the details - like the handdrawn skulls on every single plate on the wall and wall paper that looks like it's falling off - until I looked at my photos again at home. ;)They sell ice cream and cakes and although I'm sure the ice cream will taste great as well, I can only say: choose cake! Everything is homemade, looks (and smells) fantastic and the chocolate mousse cake I went for is amongst the best I've ever had. Because as soon as I took a bit, the topping got a bit more liquid and spread out over the whole cake as if it was sauce. SO DELICIOUS.Oh and they also have free wifi, fast enough to FaceTime (when you're a lonely traveler like I was) ;)."
3,Really good wholesome meal. Plenty of home grown German options to choose from. Always feel slightly uncomfortable with the staff- may be my issue since I don't speak fluent German. Sit where you want which is nice. Nice spacious restaurant and they have their own beer selection.
3,"Very delicious sushi & tepanijaki place. Great price for the value, recommend! But come with an empty stomach - u eat a lot"
3,"Oh, this place is so great! It's a spice museum!You can find plenty of information about spices, their origins, their usage and how there were and are imported. The space is actually in the Speicherstadt, the largest warehouse district in the world, located right in the port of Hamburg.The museum itself is in a warehouse that used to belong to a spice trader, so it's the perfect location for a museum dedicated to educating and advising people on the origin and usage of spices. There are over 500 years of spicy history in this museum! You can touch and even taste over 50 different spices throughout the museum. It's an amazing visit for anyone who is interested in food preparation, history and spices.Also, the entry ticket is a bag of black pepper, so you're getting something out of this visit in any case! You can also buy spices and spice mixtures after your visit. I've been back many times and absolutely love it."
3,"Pizza is extremely delicious. Dough is paper-thin and made fresh in their open kitchen. Really great recipe. I went there for dinner twice during a 4-day stay in Hamburg. Pizzas are one size only, which is huge, so unless you haven't eaten for 3 days, don't order a whole pizza for yourself, you will be very satisfied with just a half. Toppings are amazing, however, depending on which pizza you order, you may get a very small amount of the premium ingredients. This was true with the Caprese pizza which came only with 3 small slices of mozzarella and with the spicy salsiccia pizza, which came with just a handful of the spicy pepperoni slices. They have English-language menus available, a modest wine list, a nice decor, comfortable general ambiance and it was very busy both times I was there (a Saturday night, around 22:00 and a Tuesday evening, around 19:00).However, you must be wondering why I didn't rate this place with 5 stars... The answer is very simple: They serve you the wine in small ""water glasses"". And they're not even the nice kind of water glasses... I'm talking about the cheap, ugly kinds that you buy a dozen for 0,50€ at a discount store. Germany is a country of very strict laws and they should make one where restaurants are not allowed to serve wine unless they are served in wine glasses. In fact, it should be a crime to not serve wine in a proper wine glass! Specially in an Italian restaurant! I would not be surprise if Italy, along with every wine producer and sommelier in the world does not decide to rage war against this place. It was really an abomination when the waitress placed a glass of red wine on my table using that horrid glass. I immediately asked for a proper wine glass. The waitress on Saturday night promptly gave a ""you're not the only one to ask smile"" and brought a proper wine glass. Unfortunately, the waitress from Tuesday night said there were no more proper wine glasses available even though I was seated right in front of the bar and could clearly see at least 8 clean wine glasses in the shelf... Not cool. In short: fantastic pizza, order without fear! Despicable way of serving wine... Whose idea was this? Bacchus, the Roman God Of Wine is crying at the moment..."
2,"My wife and I are still on the hunt for the more American-style Chinese food (e.g. bucket of chicken fried rice), and this place is not that.Dinner was good, but fairly nondescript. I got the chicken fried rice, but there were less than half a dozen small pieces of chicken in the entire thing and on the whole it was rather bland. The fried wontons were good, but the meat-to-dough ratio was a little disappointing. She got a chicken noodle dish that she was relatively happy with, but once again, nothing outstanding.We'll probably be back because it's relatively close, but the hunt for my default take-out place continues."
3,"Update: So after now having been here a bunch of times, I remembered to come back and update this review. i almost forgot to do so but steak places have a special place in my heart. Long-story short, the place has come into its own. It's still a bit generic, hence only four instead of five stars. There is a bunch of new waitstaff so I guess they dumped people who were not up to par and have finally found people who'll stick around for a bit. We had great service again so happy on that front. I've basically only been here with guy friends (my g/f is just not into it) and everyone is always pleasantly surprised. Best bet is to come here when you want good food, are with a group and know everyone is going to drink. The outdoor area is as expected fun so definitely an option for outdoor seating. Food has remained consistent and really good. I know a bunch of people who've complained about things here but they must just hit my sense of taste. I always like the burgers, find the fries really good and the steaks with spinach are the best. This place remains an indulgence for every couple months and I'm glad they came to Hamburg. It seems like they'll stick around for a bit. With a heavy heart I am only going to give The Bird three stars at this point. I've often been to their location in Berlin and really am a big fan. The combination of great steaks and burgers, with a bit of a rockabilly atmosphere mixed in with attitude and grunginess familiar to Berlin excel at that location. I awaited patiently the opening of the Hamburg location which I received the scoop on pretty early (someone knew someone and so forth!) Anyway, the 30th of April opening night was in my calendar real early. So we went and unfortunately had too high an expectation. Don't get me wrong. The food is just as it is in Berlin. You either like it or you don't. I like it and the burgers in my opinion are awesome and the steaks are always exemplary and consistent (although I only had a burger last night......steak next time!)So why only the three stars? Well it could be because it was opening night and we will be back, so take these three stars as only preliminary for me. Anyway, some things were just off. The restaurant itself isn't ""done"". There's no real deco on the walls and it's too ""clean"". Actually with the funny painting/light ceiling thing in the middle of the restaurant area it looks like a Turkish bath renovated into a cheap Italian restaurant. Did they not get some kind of interior designer involved in this process? The lighting is off too. Granted, some lights were obviously broken but the lighting is crap. Screw the modern stuff.....throw some candles on the tables and make it a bit more intimate/moody/whatever. With the fluorescent ceiling fixtures, it's just wrong. The tables are too new and modern. Why didn't they just go out and buy up a bunch of old, beaten up benches or tables from an insolvency sale. There is so much more character in something like that and more so than this Ikea style suburban dining set set-up they have. Somehow this all has to ""age"" and get a bit beaten up before I'll truly accept it. We'll see how time changes this place and I hope they ""finish"" decorating because right now it seems clearly unfinished.Staff were super nice. We had the Brazilian guy and two girls (everyone speaks better English than German.....as in the Berlin location) and the girls all have tats. Anyway, super nice but not yet up to speed. You have to get them informed of how things were in Berlin. Your regulars are going to come expecting what they know from Berlin. Brazilian guy was almost too nice if you know what I mean. But, to counteract that, the one tattooed girl was super nice but smelled of sweat. I guess that balances things out. :-) At least someone was a bit ""grungy.On a positive note, after we finished eating we were offered shots with our bill. The crowd was a bit edgy (wonder if it stays like this). The dog from Berlin was wandering around the place which adds charm. The outdoor benches will be awesome in the summer months, just like sitting out front in Berlin is. There is a ton of potential here. I may be over critical and it was their first night but I'm willing to wait it out. I'll definitely be back and also with a group of guys instead of the missus. This is more of a place to go with a group of friends, throw back some meat and empty a couple pitchers. Not a date-night place so do keep that in mind.Long story short, I hope this isn't the American owners getting older and settled and reflecting that in their new Hamburg place. Stay true to who you were, grunge up the place a bit and make it the relaxed, rocker-edge hang-out with great food and drink that it wants to be."
2,"Solid cheap buffet. Fairly fresh, nothing too spicy, nothing too inventive. Easy to fill up here on the cheap so you don't need to eat too heavily or expensively later (if you're trying to be a budget savvy tourist). The chicken tandoori and the chicken curry were prepared well; the meat was very tender. I thought their saag was interesting - when I took my first plate it had potatoes in it, and the second time it had broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and carrot. I will say those were unusual. I'm forgetting pretty much all the other dishes since there was nothing remarkable. There was a fried veggie thing, some slightly overcooked white rice, some other veggie dishes. The mango pudding turned out to be more like an orange colored liquid sugar as I couldn't taste any mango. Not my scene. But all in all it was worth the savings to go this route and I'm glad we did. The grated coconut and sliced almond topping bowls were a nice touch. It was a pity the fresh herb was parsley and not cilantro, but we can't all be perfect."
4,"This really is an exceptional bar.  It is neighborhoody, unpretentious, but every aspect is just a step above.  The beer selection is fine (in an old-school, non-craft-beer-aficianado sense).  The outdoor seats let you settle back and reflect, and the indoor spots are pleasantly nooky.  The servers are keen, able, and cool.   A great place to hang."
3,"Good value for money.Decoration looks very authentic India-like, though the place could be cleanerRecommend it"
4,"Super! It is my Wednesday tradition now. I always order No 25, Klein gemuseteller mit Dönner . Sorry about the spelling. I tried my best. Sometimes I tried No 38 and something on the special. The food is good and worth its price."
1,"The food was just about OK but what I was really annoyed is that there was a large group of people sitting next to our table making so much noise, laughing and chatting loudly. Later I realised that they were either friends or family of the owners. My point is that if the owner wanted a family get together, they should have closed the restaurant for others!"
3,Great place for German food close to everything in Hamburg.  We had two people get the pork shank for dinner and it was excellent (a little fatty). The beer was good and the prices were good. Great value for the money. I would definitely recommend if you are spending any time in Hamburg.
2,"Having been to the original location in Munich, the Hamburg location was a little disappointing.  Service was very slow and staff was really much less interactive with our table.  Food is not bad, there certainly weren't any surprises, but I felt the food at the Munich location was a step above what we had in Hamburg.  If you are in Germany and will not have a chance to hit up the location in Munich, its certainly a place to try if you have a few days, but I would honestly recommend another location for good local German food.  This location is definitely for tourists from outside of Germany."
3,"Wow, what a great place! I headed straight here the first time I was in Hamburg when it actually didn't rain! Walking up through the hustle and bustle of the riverside past the harbour, I really wasn't sure what to expect, and was pleased to find this place with a nice level of busy-ness (i.e. plenty of different seating options and not vast queues to the bar, but still a good vibe and lots of people from all age ranges). The imported sand is soft, although it could have been cleaner. The music is funky-chill-out - something I'd hate normally but seemed to fit the place well. I didn't eat but the food (pizzas, burgers, salads) looked fresh and big portions. A perfect way to spend a hot and lazy afternoon in Hamburg, watching the big ships sail past and catching up with friends."
4,"Enzo's is around the corner from the place where we live and I came here last night with my wife for a pre-birthday meal.We had walked past the place many times but either not in the mood for Italian or it hadn't been open.So we walked in without a reservation at about 8pm and luckily got a table; 10 minutes later they were turning people away. It was nice and buzzy and fairly full with a mix of locals, tourists and business people.The waiter we had spoke German with such a strong, thick Italian accent that I couldn't understand him so we ended up speaking Italian instead! Once he knew I could speak Italian the whole experience became great; I told him more or less to choose for us then the food that came was really really fantastic.After respective starters of carpaccio and truffles & grilled squid in an octopus and black lentil salad my wife had rack of lamb and I had a Sea Bass with a salted crust. All with large glasses of red wine that we weren't told the name of but that it was 'buono' from the waiter!So it ended up being probably the nicest dinner I have had in Hamburg (maybe enven Germany so far) It wasn't cheap, at over EUR85 for two, however it would be hard to find nice food better cooked anywhere, plus the welcome, service and ambience made the difference between a good evening and great one.My wife and I agreed to go at least once a month, and I look forward to the next time.Enzo, Ci Vediamo!"
3,"Fabulous sushi! We could not sit outside as we arrived 5 people instead of the 4 we had booked for but there was no problem as during lunch hour there was plenty of space inside (apparently booking is a must for evenings). We were seated close to the kitchen/counter which was a little noisy. You can order a mixed platter to share or if you are picky and a vegetarian like me you can go for individual rolls. The 3 I ordered on recommendation were waaaay too much, go for two if you are real hungry and one for a snack! They have a veggie roll with tempura inside which adds a yummy crunch and extra taste, the other veggie roll I had was kind of bland in comparison. There are also other hot food options if you like neither sushi nor fish, and this is where they are losing one star for me as there's meat, there's fish, but there's nothing vegetarian (this, and the one ""boring"" roll I had). The restaurant has a nice atmosphere too and can seat larger groups so if you want to dine out with sushi lovers it's the perfect place."
4,"This is a good chinese place!The food is premium quality. We were 4 persons so we took the Tsingtao Menu.It consisted of a soup, springrolls, duck, beef, chicken and lamb and of course rice à gogo! Everything was delicious. We were sat at a table with a rotating part in the middle, so we were able to pass around the plates without making a mess! The restaurant is not cheap but its worth every penny"
2,"Probably over priced, for what you get, but I guess that's how they make money. We did the all you can eat dinner. It's not like typical all you can eat buffet places. You order off of an Ipad. You can order up to 10 items (for the both of us) every 10 minutes for 10 rounds. They have both sushi and ""hot plates."" The portions are small, but there were tasty options. The edamame was served cold though. Like, just taken out of the refrigerator, cold, not even room temperature. Maybe that's normal in Germany or for this place, but I found it displeasing. The sushi rolls you order come with 2 pieces (so 2 pieces is 1 item out of your 10). The salmon nigiri was very good. There were large slices of salmon over the rice, and it tasted very fresh. The sushi rolls were good as well. But keep in mind for every piece you do not eat, they will charge you extra. By the end we were forcing ourselves to finish a few sushi rolls so we didn't have to pay extra for them.  Drinks are not included, so don't be surprised at the end if your bill is slightly higher than you would pay at any other sushi restaurant. For two people, we ended up paying about 65 Euros for our dinner. We definitely wouldn't spend that much if we went to any other sushi restaurant and ordered individual rolls, however, we also wouldn't have been able to try so many different things. So if you're on a budget, maybe skip this place. The sushi took a long time to arrive. If we ordered sushi in round 2, it would arrive at the same time if not after we had ordered hot dishes in round 3. It also took a long time to find our waiter so we could pay. When one of the servers came and picked up our empty plates, we told him we were ready to pay and he said he would tell his colleague. It took another 10 or so minutes before we even saw our waiter so we could ask to pay again. I took away 2 stars for the slow service and slow food delivery, and the high price."
4,"Came here after a long walk around the city.  I sat outside on the picnic tables and ordered the seasonal special... a hamburger patty with white asparagus, potatoes and a big boat of hollandaise.  The best hollandaise I've ever had.  The meal was delicious.  Very friendly people that come here and the locals chatted me up even though I was a tourist.  Hamburg is great"
4,"Amazing museum, great collection !There are so many details, like lights from the interior of trains. I loved the day/night scenography, it is a brilliant idea !I think I just fell in love with this museum !"
3,"One of my favorite gluten free Italian restaurant in Hamburg! Oh yes, they can make real gluten free food and of course, normal gluten meals. All of them r quite tasty, especially meat dishes and pastas. Absolutely great service, but sometimes because of too many customs eating there. U might need to wait for a while. Love their decoration style and music!"
4,"A nice place with friendly stuff , and the food is AMAZING !! Highly recommend this place !"
4,Possibly the most beautiful building in Hamburg. It still impresses me after many years in Hamburg and I'm always finding out new things about it.
3,"Nice place for the spring or summer, loads of parking and outside space. Our waitresses were very nice, informative and friendly which always helps for a chilled atmosphere. The service was with a smile and the cocktails and wine were better than expected. We had the set menu and enjoyed the overall experience. Try this place!"
4,"It is located beside the Alster so it is very suitable if you were there sight seeing and wanted to grab some quick sushi. The All-You-Can-Eat is for about 20 euros.You just sit and keep picking up the plates that you like, which is a variety of rolls, nigiri sushi, sashimi, and even dessert sometimes. I've went 3 times, and each time some of the plates are changed with new ones, so I guess the menu changes every day, but the main plates (nigiri and rolls are always served).You can also have a drink but can be a bit expensive, the AYCE with a small pepsi (0.33 litre) costs about 22.2 euros and with a big pepsi (0.5 litre) costs about 24.2 euros.My only comment is that the nigiri sushi contains too much rice and thin fish slices, and the lack of fried rolls (although there are fried prawns occasionally).--Update 1:I went for a fourth time, and this time they had fried rolls.The staff crew is also very friendly, and they recogized me from last time."
3,This is my first salad's place in Hamburg and it turned out to be great. Best thing is you can create your own salad with awesome sauces. There was a queue at lunch time but salad was great.I will definitely go again!
0,"Sorry to have to give this restaurant one star.  Ate there for lunch twice, one week apart, in July 2017.  First lunch visit I ordered the vegetarian lunch menu.  The taste of the food was fine but an hour later I was running to the toilet.  i thought, things happen, something I ate didn't agree with me.I went back exactly a week later and this time I ordered the Chicken lunch menu.  Same thing happened.I will not be going back.  Sorry."
1,"My husband managed to book a later dinner reservation to celebrate my birthday. Our reservation was at about 9:30 and the place was still pack. Even with a reservation we still had to wait about 15 minute or so to be seated. Once seated I saw that my husband left a note for them that it was my birthday and they had little happy birthday confetti on the our table which was a nice touch.After that I really didn't have a good experience with the service or the food sadly. Our waiter forgot our appetizers and Everytime we ordered drinks the drink servers looked confused and always ended at the wrong table first before realizing the drinks actually should go to ours. For our meal, we decided on the omakase which was like a 4 course chefs choice menu. Everything was a bit too oversauced for my taste and so the only dish I enjoyed and thought was unique was the dessert (which was more German than Japanese). And when it came time to pay the bill, our server was nowhere to be found...so we had to flag down a different waitress to get the bill.Overall, I probably won't be going back here especially not for a good sushi fix. It's overpriced for what it is and is not my vibe unfortunately."
4,"This place is amazing.It's not a ""fancy"" place, where you go, dress up and dance until morning light.It's a very simple bar, filled with a lot of Nerds. The Customers there either love Roleplay games (the ones with dices!), old TV-Series, Videogames or Sci-Fi or Fantasystuff.Most of the people there wear black band shirts and most of the time ""evil black music"" comes from the speakers, if not somebody gets out the guitar and playes a song.It's a rustical and cozy place, you easily feel home at, due to the atmosphere. The customers there are very open and the staff is super friendly and does its best to serve all special demands. Thier bartender is really nice and they have everything from coffee, over beers and shorts to fancy cocktails.It's a good place to have weirdly amazing conversations with people you just met."
2,"Very average indian food. Veg thali was better than other dishes. But, i guess that's okay with that price. Also, you can buy fresh sweets and bhujiyas which are really good. I also bought panner (cottage cheese) for my home and it was really good!"
4,"The food is authentic and high quality. The restaurant is very well decorated and the staff are friendly. Best of all, they serve food that would be served in Vietnam. Very authentic! I highly recommend this restaurant!"
4,"Great restaurant that really has it all:* Fun location at the heart of bustling Eimsbüttel.* An eclectic interior design that mixes a boar's head with Riviera style bookshelves full of cook books and golden candlestick-holders.* A really innovative menu of German dishes with a modern twist.* And friendly staff with enough personality to give non-boilerplate recommendationsWe tremendously enjoyed the giant pork chops in cocoa cauce, goat cheese apple burgers, a lovely Spanish red wine made of Grenache and Tempranillo grapes, and a lovely sweet but crisp dessert wine that wasn't on the menu."
3,"Suntan o'clock! It really is kind of like being on a real beach, except you've just walked from your house and you can't actually jump in the Elbe, just see it. A relaxed vibe, decent seating/cushions if you get in early, and a nice bar that will even serve Weissbier with a straw - totally tropical. My only gripe would be the amount of cigarette butts in the sand. So no 5th star. Still - something very different and cool to show off to your English friends!"
4,"Paralment has a Fantastic Hall for 200 people. Great place. Love the bar area, good Lighting inside, grand entrance, perfect for -The great Gatsby theme :)"
4,"Wonna try good Hamburg fish...?? You can't miss Fisch & Co.! Really cozy restaurant (with just 3 tables) that prepares fresh fish on-the-fly. Dishes are delicious...I suggest to give a try at fish and chips...the best that I took in my life! Please note that the restaurant is really small. On rainy days it's really hard to get a seat, so good for takeaways, but not for long seating lunches..."
4,A great place for a peaceful walk away from the main roads. There is also a dear sanctuary in the park. Ideal place also for running or walking the dog.
1,"It is what it is. It's an easy spot, but the food isn't stellar. It's affordable but tastes like so so delivery food."
4,"Seit wir vor 1 1/2 Jahren nach Niendorf gezogen sind, sind wir regelmässig dort gewesen. Frisch, lecker (!), reichlich, günstig, was will man mehr. Und zum draußen sitzen ist es auch noch ganz besonders nett, da nicht direkt auf dem Tibarg sondern ein bißchen versteckt im Durchgang.Ganz besonders gerne läuten wir hier an einem warmen Freitag späten Nachmittag das Wochenende ein  Entspannung pur!Die Bedienung ist außerordentlich freundlich, immer! Gäste zum großen Teil etwas älter, wie so oft in Niendorf, aber uns stört's nicht, wenn wir action wollen, gehen wir ins City Wir sind froh, daß wir dieses Kleinod gefunden haben."
4,Great Location when the weather is Bad! :)You should come early in the morning or 2 hours befor they close the exebition! Otherwise it will be maybe overcrowded
3,"This place is absolutely delish!! Im very picky w buffet restaurants.. this place has ""superb"" quality meats, fish, and veggies. They have to roll us out of here eventually  btw the restaurant is huge and interior design is modern and white. Very nice!"
3,"Very nice little Pizza place in Talstraße, just a few steps away Dron the Reeperbahn. It's definitely not easy to eat inside because of its size (during summer there are some more seats outside though) but pizza is good and quite cheap. Give it a try of you are in the Reeperbahn area and you are hungry!"
0,"Expensive for what it is: our dishes were not well cooked, the quantity served was too little and the recipies were not really ""elaborate"". My advice: do not stop by this restaurant, you'll find many more interesting ones in the same neighbourhood."
4,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant while exploring Hamburg on our vacation from the US. My boyfriend is vegan, so food options can be very limited. Piccolo Paradiso could not have been a more perfect place to enjoy an early dinner. We sat on the patio, which was peaceful, with a nice cool breeze. Our waiter was incredibly kind and helpful, since neither of us speak German. He went over the entire menu with us, in English. We decided on a vegan antipasti/tapas platter, as well as a dessert to share. It was the best mixed plate of food I've ever had - vegan or otherwise. The compilation of different flavors from different regions and countries was absolutely divine. We savored every bite. The limonade was delightful as well. We tried the rose water as well as the raspberry, and they were both refreshing, cool, and crisp. Dessert was decadent - chocolate creme brulee that was to die for. Favorite meal we've had in a very, very long time. Best in Hamburg, for sure! We recommend it, 100%."
3,"I visit green lovers every few weeks for a salad lunch. They have a handful of predetermined salad recipes to choose from, or you can choose your own adventure with several dozen salad toppings available. They also serve some soups and curries, and a handful of sandwich options. My favorite salad is the Nordisch by Nature, which includes cucumbers, radishes, spring onions, and smoked salmon over lettuce, with a creamy yogurt dressing and a sprinkle of mustard sauce. I've also tried the chicken sesame salad, which was okay but not great. All of the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared, and the staff is friendly. If you get there at peak lunch time (12:30-1:00), there will probably be a queue of 5-10 people waiting to place their orders, but things move pretty quickly, and you can order salads to eat in or take away."
4,"This is my favorite restaurant for a German lunch in Hamburg. If you want a 'lighter' meal, I suggest getting a sandwich. I always get the one with Rindfleisch (beef). Never been disappointed here, always good quality!"
3,Best ice cream/gelato I've had yet in Hamburg. Very creamy and smooth. I had one scoop of After Eight and one of hazelnut. I wish the After Eight was mintier but both tasted like mint and hazelnuts. The chocolate and nut cone left something to be desired - it was stale. I'd say stick with a cup and you should have a 5 star experience!
3,"To be totally honest i don't come here to eat. I come for the beer!For the huge (1L) mass beer!And their pretzels! Lovely 'Oktoberfest themed' pub.I've been there only by night. on the week ends its always packed. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in a typical bavarian costums.There's also live music, typical german folkoric music, that i as a non-german dont know, but still dance to! It's a great place, especially if you're out of town or you have visitors."
4,"YES! This is the best little gem I was able to find in Hamburg.After being in Germany for a week, I had yet to have my favourite German food, Maultaschen.  I had one day left so quickly took to yelp to find a place that would serve this wonderful thing.Fortunately I came across Zum Spatzle!  We walked in when there were fortunately enough seats to accommodate us.  There are only about 10 tables in the whole restaurant so we were lucky to get a place for 3.This place is run by a one woman band, who takes your order and makes all the food for you.  Situated on a cozy little street, I would definitely recommend for lunch.And get the maultaschen with Egg (Ei).  It is amazing and I promise you you won't regret it."
3,"After a long afternoon of shopping/windown shopping in what is probably our favorite street in Hamburg we decided to rest our shoppign weary feet and grab a coffee. This place although large with four different seating areas it's still hard to find a place to sit. the place looked good though so we thought it was worth the 5-10 minute wait for a good seat. The lattes were decent, the cake moist, menu is well priced and atmosphere is chilled out and relaxed. A perfect place for brunch with friends or just afternoon coffee and cake. Good service too although you have to order and pay at the bar."
1,"Wow, surprised at all the positive reviews here. Some people either have really low standards, or many of these are faked. This place was quite a disappointment. Outside of the decent sized portion of Aioli and bread to kick of the meal, everything else went downhill. I'm almost inclined to give only one star but I've had worse (directly in the area where this restaurant is!) I actually feel that most of the restaurants in the area are horrible and hence the general quality of all is drawn downwards. This place may have had it's prime but is long past it now. Our waiter didn't quite understand the concept of service. The food itself was absolutely mediocre and a day later, I have some serious indigestion from the lamb with garlic dish. Food was thrown on to the table basically when being served to us. The waiter couldn't be bothered to come to our table regularly to check on things and he really didn't care to be nice. The prices are also much too high for what you get. Finally, where I was sitting outside, right next to their entrance, it stank. There was a nasty odor coming from the ground level vent right there. Gosh I hope this wasn't coming from their kitchen. This place may have been good but no more. I'd seriously consider twice if you plan on eating there."
4,"So good! Boyfriend loves burgers and we both had heard good things about this place so we tried it out. We both loved our meals. I'm not a big steak person so I tried the K-Rod crispy chicken sandwich and it was seriously so good. Also good beer options from tap!Service was very friendly, and made an effort to chat with us a little bit here and there. Price is a bit higher but still reasonable as the food here is top notch. Don't forget to make a reservation! You can make it online through their reservation system very easily."
3,"Good burgers, but nothing special. The fried were nice as well. Overall, I'd recommend it to watch some sports."
3,"Been there for lunch. The decoration is very nice and it feels very cosy. The service is ok, but not as friendly as I would wish for in a restaurant.I ordered a duck curry and was surprised when I received a sour chicken soup as a starter. For lunch I wasn't used to that and it tasted really nice. The main course was also tasty and I can also recommend it for people who want the option to order their dishes ""Thai spicy"".Unfortunately the tast has it's price. About 13€ for a lunch dish is already a premium."
4,"There's nobody in Hamburg, who doesn't know this place. Why? As you walk down the street at Schanze this bar is the first that looks inviting and worth trying. And I must say, it's nice there, it's stylish, warm atmosphere, clean toilets (i have to say that, cause there are so many bars with utterly ugly WCs). Can get really packed late in the evening. Really good crowd: yound, trendy and cool people, sometimes too cool. It's not the cheapest bar, but also not the most expensive."
0,"The food is fine, but the service is so so so bad. I literally waited 90 minutes between ordering and getting my food. I've had two perfectly nice evenings ruined by coming here. Then again, it's always ram packed, so they're obviously doing something right."
4,"One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Coffee was well brewed and their flat white really nice (comes with two tiny biscuits). Their French breakfast is really generous, with nice fresh bread, 7 delicious French cheeses with fig mustard and some red berry marmelade, and a truly airy and spectacular butter croissant. And their special out of menu Eggs Benedict were absolutely perfect. Really fresh, free range eggs, beautifully poached with yellow yolks and super crunchy bacon. Swoon. Already made a reservation for next week, as I am hosting guests!"
3,"Beautiful building and scenery, really good to discover different types of tea. Only slight problem is that it takes a bit of time to get the bill. Would def go again!"
4,"Excellent tasting Anatolian Cuisine. Actually no more words are necessary to explain. Every single item we ordered was masterfully prepared. Dinner time was very busy, so we decided to come later around 11pm. It was still busy, but very well managed. Desserts were both exotic and delicious."
1,The food was great but really poor service and a very rude waiter. My first time there was great but the second time i had to wait for long until i was offered to seat and the waiter was very unfriendly. He threw my Atm card at me instead of just handing back politely. I will always go back and i look forward to better service.
3,I have a great liking for Chinese food that's why i was drawn to this place. This place kept its word. The food especially the Sezuan beef soup was mind-blowing.
3,"Just in terms of the art of plating, this restaurant is easily in the top 10 of all time that I have ever dined at or experienced. Every dish was exceptionally photo-worthy, from multiple angles, and literally compelled you to take out your smartphone and photograph it. Simply put, our dinner was art on a plate. The food here also had many different flavor profiles and flavor combinations that would test the range of many people's palettes. The cuisine is French-Moroccan. Some could easily find it odd or mis-matched. I appreciated it because it was something new and often had me saying ""hmmm...interesting...good, but very different.""Seven courses per person were a bit on the pricey side -- moths flew out of my wallet after I paid the bill -- but it was a wonderful celebration dinner that night, all in all, for multiple reasons.If you really want to taste something a little bit different, bold, new or refreshing, where the food is beautifully plated, then this is the place."
4,"My boyfriend and I are in Hamburg for just a day and we decided to stop here based on the excellent reviews(though only few). You must keep the restaurants appearances out of your impression because the food and the hospitality of the staff make this five star worthy! I had the Wiener schnitzel, which was very flavorful and a huge serving! My boyfriend ate the curry wurst which was also excellent. If we were staying in Hamburg longer we would definitely make another trip here!"
3,"Friendly, relaxing, good beer, good crowd and lots of sofas. Great place to meet and chat. One of the best bars around. As you will gather from the other reviews, there is no name on the door, so make sure you check the map location. Oh, and all the sofas you can see is also a clue!"
4,"Great park for jogging, dog walking, picnic and just laying in the sun. You can get there really easy for it near elbchausse.I think there was even a bus station right next to the park entry."
0,Got it to go. As far as getting it on time great job. However very disappointing sushi. They were falling apart. The fried sushi was stuffed with what tasted and looked like canned tuna. The fish tasted old and we felt very unwell afterwards. We were supposed to get squid sushi but it was not in the package. Everything was either horrible or tasteless.
4,"The seat of the ""Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg"", this building is on the Rathausmarkt square. Constructed between 1186 and 1897, this is also the seat of one of the 16 state parliaments of Germany. Government still operates from here.I did not have time for a proper tour of the building, but the next time I am in Hamburg, I absolutely will do so. The lobby is open to the public and you can get to a few other places if the parliament is not actually in session.[Review 12060 overall, 1843 of 2019.]"
4,"Just finish classes at Colon Language School? Go to this small basement restaurant called ""Delikatessen des Meeres"" two buildings away. There's no menu. The chef cooks one dish per day and varies daily, depending on what's freshly supplied on the day. Sometimes shrimps with potatoes, sometimes salmon spaghetti with mustard sauce to die for. EUR 5,50 each. Portion is humungous. You'll drop your jaw to pay so little for such quality food. Fresh!! Waiting time is long, between 20-40 mins during lunch. You will be told the number of bell ring to collect your plate. Sitting is limited to indoor area, can get quite narrow during winter. Great ambient to eat with Opera and Classical music. Food cooked with love. Best time to go: Summer before or after lunch-time (waiting time 5-10 mins)! There's many sitting area outdoor. My perfect place to chill out under sunshine in Summer!!! Best goes with a glass of wine for EUR 3,50... hmm, maybe two..."
1,"I've been to many dim sum restaurants, including those in China, but this one missed the mark. The choices are quite limited and the taste of the dishes are ok-ish. The vegan buddharol for example was really chewy and greasy, instead of being crispy. The other dim sums were ok, but a bit on the small side. We also ordered fried noodles with Cha Sieuw, only there was not enough meat in the dish... the staff was constantly checking on you whether you are finished eating or drinking, which gave the diner a 'fast-food' feeling. The paent could only be done with cash or credit card, they didn't accept (EU) Maestro cards... Hamburg really needs a Chinatown."
0,"Tried 4 rolls, all turned out to be deepfried and tasted all the same, like ranchid old fat. Can't believe the positive reviews here."
1,"Mutter, a bar I have never managed to get into. No, not because of their door policy, but because all of the smokers of Hamburg and the rest of the world now congregate here and chainsmoke like beagles in a Huntingdon life sciences lab. Not I'm not one to whinge about passive smoking, far from it. But when the only way to survive in a bar is to don scuba gear well, it's over for me. I can't swim anyway."
4,"Best Restaurant in Hamburg. Food is amazing and the staff is great. The Mezze offers different starters every time, and the rack of lamb is delicious time and time again."
3,"Nice place to go and get just about everything, and it all tastes good too! Lots of students and a relaxed atmosphereif you can get a table. If it's nice weather, you can enjoy the outdoor seating. Apothecary decorations and friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices and huge selection for good quality, normal food."
3,"You can't get cheaper than free, and so it's hard to be anything less than happy with a visit to the Botanic Gardens in Planten und Blomen. It's great on a cold winter's day because everything is so nice and tropical in there - the heating costs must be enormous! However, unless you're massively into plants, then it's not that interesting. My favourite bits were the insect-eating plants, and the cactus room."
4,"With what appears to be a well stocked bar, and a menu with lots of options, I'm having a difficult time deciding which options to take.I'll keep it simple and order a beer to help me decide on the meal.I chose theHähnchenbrustfilet mit Pfefferkornsauce und rostbrot (chicken breast filet, with peppercorn sauce and oven roasted bread).It was nicely prepared and presented.Tasty meal for my last night in Hamburg."
4,This is definitely a must-see when you're visiting Hamburg. Or when you live here.
4,"I didn't have really high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised! We arrived at 2pm on a Friday afternoon in April. They said we would need to wait 45 minutes, as they let people in on a co trolled basis to avoid overcrowding. We didnt mind waiting at all, since it gave us a chance to rest anyway. The exhibits are absolutely mind blowing in terms of the attention to detail. You can also see the artists at work, as they allow you to watch the creation of new displays.  You will get the sense of how painstaking it is to create all the displays that they did. We enjoyed the Italy displays the most. We felt the US displays were put together a bit too randomly.   For example, you have a backdrop of a tornado, against a space shuttle launch, situated next to Las Vegas and Miami beach. The US displays were also a bit sterotypical, which included a ""gold rush"" scene that didn't seem synced up. Lots of fun though. The displays include working trains, lights, transitions from day to night, etc. Plan to spend at least 2 hours there."
4,Ticks all the right boxes. Decent range of Asian dishes at affordable prices. Big portions and always excellent customer service. I'm a regular and a big fan.
3,"I cycled to Volkspark for the first time this weekend, and while a lot of the park is relatively uncared for, there is some great woodland and nice paths for walking, jogging or cycling. I should mention that it's not suitable for roadbikes - a mountain bike would be best. The woodland here was actually more fun to cycle around than that in the nearby Niendorfer Gehege forest, and there are some reasonably sized hills. Almost part of the park is the Dahliengarten which is incredibly well cared for, and I assume from walking around it has probably the biggest collection of Dahlia flower species in the world. Also just on the edge of the park is the Hauptfriedhof Altona (main Altona cemetery), which is also nice to walk around. Overall, I think it's a better park for cycling, jogging or walking the dog than actually using as a standard park - most of Volkspark is forested."
4,"OMG.... great coffee - fair prices- great authentic atmosphere- super friendly staff! I arrived after a long trip and was super tired - was greeted with ""moin"" and felt like home straight away. I ordered a large cappuccino and the ""katzenfrühstück"" ... basic scrambled egg with Toast! Simple but delicious"
2,"This is OK Thai food for people who are not overly fussy about Thai food.I usually have pretty specific ideas about what the food I order is supposed to taste like. Nothing we ordered here tasted the way I thought it should have, but it was nice enough all the same.My husband ordered the cashew chicken which was generously portioned with nuts, veggies and meat in a flavorful sauce.I ordered a Tom Kha Gai which was a bit bland, but I soon fixed that up with some chilis in fish sauce (what they bring you in lieu of hot sauce). Was pleased. But then came my fried noodles which, in all fairness, more or less the exact same thing one gets at whatever Hamburg's equivalent of China Box is. Sure, it had bok choy and lots of meat in it, but it was absolutely flavorless and uninspired.We couldn't find anything resembling Phad Thai on the menu; maybe it was there and we missed it, but I was pretty disappointed about that. None of the awesome rice noodle dishes, no Pad See-Ew either.For the price, I thought we could have done much better at the dim sum up the street or even at the China Wok imbiss at the train station.The service was competent and the food was not bad, but we work hard for the little money we have and will spend it elsewhere in the future. Nothing wrong with paying a decent price for good food but that was not really what we found herejust mediocre versions of potentially amazing dishes for people without a lot of experience with Thai cuisine."
3,"Really nice and cozy pub in the center of Hamburg. I enjoyed here a dinner after a soccer match...and it was kind of ""rejuvenating"". Nice beers and nice burgers.I took the Eva's: chicken breast, bacon and salad with fried potatoes. Really nice, good size and just 8€. Everything well cooked and the overall taste was well balanced.I really loved the internals, wooden table and chairs, rhe candles and the dark atmosphere!"
3,"We went for dinner on a Thursday and it was quite quiet, but this may also be due to the bad weather outside which doesn't really attract walk in customers. We had a three course menu with the accompanying wines and thought it was pretty good. The soup was very good, the fish was a huge portion and tasted good, but wasn't hot anymore. Dessert was a chocolate tarte which I believe should have been with a liquid core, which it wasn't The server was very nice and friendly, though a bit unsure at times. With better weather we would come back."
4,"A real gem near the cruise ship docks on the Elbe. A restaurant as part of a fish market, the food is excellent and not pricey. The platter of mussels Provencal I had was enormous! only 10 euros! Perfectly cooked and served with baguette and aioli."
4,"Golden is certainly one of my top favourite chinese restaurants in Europe. Instead of choosing from the German menu, I recommend to talk to the owner-manager, a smiling chubby 50 year-old chinese who speaks English and is very friendly and helpful. If there's too many people to get a hold of him, choose dishes on the menu starting from number 700 and above. Those are the authentic ones. All previous ones are for foreigners. I beg you not to drink soft drinks with this food, order jasmin tea for heaven's sake! They actually serve an excellent one, a rare thing these days and a distinct sign of quality."
0,Good food but the waiter charged me 3 euro for a glass of water.... not happy at all.
0,"Not a really good soup place --- for typical Phó. Small portion, and full of artificial taste. ---- definitely not recommend for Asians.Very noisy environment and unfriendly  service."
4,"The best pizza ever! Leave it to a little Italian joint in the Portuguese section of Hamburg to make the most mouth-watering, buttery slice of heaven. The place is tiny, crowded and noisy, but the waiters are charming and fun. When in Hamburg, you've got to try Luigi's!"
2,"Food was good, but there are literally wasps in the food containers.  Not sure if this will affect people with allergies, but the wasps are literally crawling on the food, and it seems that the staff doesn't care.  That's what I interpreted it as at least."
4,"Wonderful cafe for breakfast, desserts or fancy coffee drinks. The warm crumble with ice cream was a special favorite. It has a very warm and cozy atmosphere."
2,"Food is okay, but everything is on the pricey side. Very interesting spot for a cosy italian restaurant. Always very busy amd very hard to get them on the phone in order to book a table. Best to just show up there and maybe wait 10mins for a table to open up. Despite it being hectic, the personnel do try their best and keep smiling."
3,"Wow - all the hype is accurate! Really good/incredible cakes and coffee. Minus one star because it's so busy and loud. We came at 4pm on a Friday, prime Kaffeeklatsch time and it was really busy. The cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had, the poppy seed mousse cake with cassis was also incredible but my rhubarb meringue cake was disappointing. The cake was flavorless, the filling was really solid, and the meringue was weepy. Pour over coffee was great too. Will absolutely be back. I wish they had a cookbook I could buy!"
3,"Nice interior and friendly staff! Unfortunately, they ran out of croissants only 1.5 hours after the opening."
1,"Wir wollten gestern Hotdogs bei Miss Sofie essen  um 12:30 haben wir die Aussage bekommen, dass diese nicht vor 13 Uhr warm sein, wenn die Bedienung jetzt anfangen würde. Das Eis war die letzten Male sehr lecker (dafür die zwei Sterne)  aber bei einem von zwei Besuchen waren von den zwei vorhandenen Softeissorten (Schoko und Vanille) nur eine vorhanden :-(. Und teuer ist es auch noch. Grundsätzlich eine tolle Idee, aber irgendwie hapert es noch an der Umsetzung."
4,"I've been to Ti Breizh a few times now and once again, it was absolutely delicious. Generally, I nosedive in the direction of all things sweet but I can't get enough of the savory menu here. The L'envie is my favorite galette on the menu. Pro tip: if you have more than 4 in your group, make a reservation. If you are more than 2 and don't like to wait, I also suggest making a reservation."
4,"I always thought of this place like a ""burger place"". Today I've tried chicken wings. What can I say? You just cannot go wrong with both. Make sure you get beer in 1L jugs."
4,"Oh my god ! First you walk in and you see this cute guy with amazing eyes and a big warm smile behnd the counter. He makes you the best coffee ever and gives you a slice of cheesecake. You are in heaven.Then comes the dilema. what do you do ?Try and pick up the cute guy ?Take home the cheesecake ? Well, I'm sorry to say cute guy, but I think it's going to have to be the cheesecake. I'm sure you taste good too, but the cheesecake definately tastes better."
3,"For work reasons I wanted to try new Catering restaurants. Not only those the food tastes good, they are efficient, fast and know what their clients want! They come on time and are extremely friendly. Totally recommend them!"
3,"Dean and David is a nice place to have lunch in the city, as it is located close to the main station. I tried the curry, which was very tasty. The staff was very nice and I liked the interior as well. It is simple but very nice.You need to go up some stairs to get to the restaurant."
4,"I had come to Hamburg to listen to the magnificent Kate Tempest and my parents decided to come with me. Not to listen to the words of a slam poet, but to eat food and see the city, mind. We found Sagners because of the great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. Because we like to eat in our family, but usually don't have the stomach space to contain all the food we want to devour, we came to Sagners not that hungry. But there is a little something for everyone here. I had scrambled eggs with shrimp on blackbread, which could be awfully dull, but actually tasted like fresh shrimp straight from the sea combined with perfectly scrambled eggs. It was good. Sitting outside is not that attractive as it leads to a pretty busy road, but you'll soon forget it with all of that German beer and seaside fare inside you."
4,"I absolutely love this place. It's like the definition of hipster. It's. So. Trendy. Looks exactly like the stuff my designer ex-flatmate produced. (And he was really talented, so that's a compliment.)And they definitely know their coffee too! There's not only coffee from most parts of the world; once you start talking to the owners (I think?) about coffee, they just go full on passion lecture mode on you. In a good way.If you like coffee, I'd seriously recommend going here with a friend (special or regular kind) and  do a coffee tasting. Owner recommended trying out the same beans as espresso and regular coffee to spot the difference. And then there's of course different kinds of beans with different kinds of roasts.........Sounds like a pretty great pass-time to me.  Well, if you like coffee that is."
4,"Classic Greek! No major decorations, no shi-shi people, just quality food and heartfelt service. It's not often you go into a restaurant where a bunch of people hug the owner before leaving. I am sure these are the regulars but nice to see. This also isn't gourmet cooking. Its basic Greek food prepared really well. If you're looking for something fancy go elsewhere. There is both indoor and outdoor seating with a small bar right past the entrance. The menu is what you'd expect. There is a nice selection of wines and other drinks. Although I wouldn't remove any stars for this, there isn't necessarily a lot of parking in the area so you're better off biking it or taking public transport."
4,"I had bad home sickness, so a friend of mine and me decided to go to this Lithuanian restaurant yesterday. Not Russian but some pretty similar meals. We've been in the ""Teigtasche"" for the first time. But I definitely want to come back again. When you enter the restaurant it already looks and feels quite snug and welcoming. The filled pastries tasted almost like the Pelmeni and Vareniki my mum and grandma's used to make in my childhood. Very delicious. They offer a huge variety of dishes and self-made liquors. I highly recommend this restaurant for all fans of East European cuisine and for those who miss the cuisine of Mam. :-D"
0,"This is a mexican restaurant?! More like a nightclub with tables! I'm seriously glad that I ate before meeting friends here. At the door there was a queue of 50 people waiting to get in, all dressed up, on the pull. It was moving at a rate of 2 people per minute. Coming from inside the restaurant was booming dance music. Ok, Ok, I was sorta expecting a bar. I wasn't expecting a meat-market club though. It's not as terrible as my 1 star rating, it's just not my kind of place, and I'll probably not be back is all"
3,A great place to eat as a couple or with a group of friends. Great service and food. Moderately priced. Good atmosphere. All in all we had a great experience. We will definitely return.
4,"It's a burger bar, not a 5 star restaurant, but we had a 5 star experience. It was recommend to us by our local bike tour leader as the best burger in Hamburg. We don't have any other hamburger experiences in Hamburg to compare, but we believe he didn't lie when he said that he's tested them all!It's busy so expect to wait for a table. We sat outside with a pitcher of beer. (For some unknown reason they wouldn't serve food outside.)We were seated in about 15 minutes.The burger choices are extensive. We had one farmhouse burger, one blue cheese burger and one vegetarian burger made from halloumi cheese. There were several vegetarian/vegan options, but I've never seen halloumi cheese offered as a burger, so I had to try it. It was great!The farmhouse burger was a great surprise. It was a tower of meat that could easily feed a family of 6. Not what we were expecting. I think something got lost in the German translation. It was impressive even though my husband can only eat a small portion of it. Each burger was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and the quality of meat was very good. For sides we had fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. The truffle Mayo For dipping was delicious.It was not a healthy dinner by any means. The piece of lettuce on the burger does not count as a serving of vegetable! But if you only want 1 burger in hamburger, this is an excellent choice."
3,"Barley & Malt is an Irish pub in the center of Hamburg at the Deichstraße close to the building where the great fire started in 1842. The street is very nice and it is possible to sit outside in the summer. The interior and the decoration are similar to most Irish pubs I have been to. The TV screens show football, rugby or cricket.  The pub offers several snacks and small dishes. I only tried the Nachos which tasted good.To access the pub you need to go up some stairs."
2,"Very touristic place, cocktails are rather sweet, then alcoholic. View on Harbor is good, but qui lift of service is average"
4,"By far one of the best top-class Italian restaurants in Hamburg -- hands down.Recently, I went here with two guests from Dubai who have wined and dined in many of the best restaurants in the world.Gallo Nero's team did not let me down and my guests and I had a fantastically palatable three-course meal with excellent service in an authentically Italian atmosphere in a pleasant surrounding.We all had the pasta with summer truffle for the starter, delicious mains with either turbot, filet from the Fassona Piemontese, or veal, and a lemon-mint sorbet for desert. I am getting hungry writing this review by just remembering how delicious everything was.Yes, Gallo Nero is a bit more on the pricey side, but it is totally worth having very happy guests and such fond memories of an excellent Italian dining experience."
1,"No vegan or vegetarian food (even in the veggie ramen has fish inside), the edamame was less salty than it should be. My partner wasn't blown away with his noodles either.  Don't get me wrong it is a good place to be if you eat meat and like ramen. However, don't waste your time as vegetarian or vegan there."
3,"Wow, the best American-style breakfast I've seen in town so far! Fluffy pancakes with yummy Canadian maple syrup, and kaffee satt  free coffee refills! Cute deco, kinda small (could imagine it might be hard to get a table sometimes, but there seems to be room to squeeze 1-2 people in somewhere), and sometimes from time to time kinda loud music. Nice window bar-type seating as well, and the cheesecakes looked scrumptious! Friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices (2 big brunches and coffees for 2 for 21.40EUR). Will go again for brunch or coffee and cake!"
2,"Was here today for lunch. The lunch prices are really good (6 euro for a pizza and glas of watter) and the Pizza is very good. If you don't care about more, you may like or love it.I reduce two stars on the review, because this location is very dark inside and felt like a dinner in the dark. Second point is the service, which was very unfriendly. We got a bunch of forks and knives thrown on the table, so we had to collect them from the table. The order was hard to place, because the worker doesn't want to help or explain and was permanently in a hurry. At least we got the bill for 6 persons together, even we asked to pay seperate. I will maybe try it again to another time or directly for a take away. All other restaurants in the near have the same problem at lunch and still can act friendly."
3,"Kornhauskeller is an extremely misleading name for a Lebanese/Syrian restaurant. Then again, they have a Wiener Schnitzel special on Thursdays, which isn't something you'd expect from your typical Lebanese restaurant.Confused identity aside, food and service are on point here. I usually go for their falafel plate with salad. The ingredients are fresh, the salad isn't just a few leaves of lettuce, the combination of dressing and harissa pairs really well with everything, and there is a good balance between salad and falafel.Service is efficient and attentive, sometimes to the point of lacking warmth, especially with the head waiter (and maybe owner?). That said, they handle large groups really well for such a small space. We had a group lunch with 11 recently and were comfortably seated inside. I don't think they'd be able to accommodate a much larger group than that, though. They also have outdoor seating when the weather warms up.For clarification regarding the two signs out front, Palmyra is the catering business (and also a much better name for a Lebanese restaurant)."
4,"Very good food, amazing view, comfortable atmosphere  the service was not too short and not too long, perfect to spend a relaxed evening enjoying Italian food"
4,Great Vietnamese street food style restaurant with a cool vibe! Definitely try the Vietnamese ice coffee. Ask for the spicy vinegar if you need a bit more tang. Recommended!
4,"Best pizza in Hamburg, and not exorbitantly priced. Their salsiccia pizza is amazing."
3,"It's a vegan cafe in St Pauli. With plenty of seating outdoors for the warmer days, this is a nice cafe run by very friendly people. The menu is not huge but enough choices to satisfy most people's needs. They have a daily specials board and a few options for drinks. It was packed the whole time we were there and it's a relatively young crowd. I had the club sandwich special and my wife had the quiche of the day. Food tasted good but I wish there was a little less leaves and red cabbage in both meals. The cake I had for dessert was also very nice. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this is a nice option in town. Even if you are not it's worth a try :-) It's reasonable, simple and clean food. Everything is super fresh and staff are friendly."
4,"Delicious, affordable, healthy options, very friendly and nice staff, and the place is super cute and cozy! Highly recommended!"
4,"On an early December Sunday,I was fortunate to appreciate this art museum's splendid collection of Renaissance Period paintings by German and Netherlandish painters.German painters with fine Late Gothic and Renaissance Period paintings at this art museum included: Bertram Von Minden(""Altarpiece from ""Harvestehude""),Hinrik Funhof (""Virgin in Robe Decorated With Ears of Corn""),Master Francke((""Christ As Man of Sorrows""),Hans Burgmair the Elder(""Agony in Garden""),Hans Schaufelein(""Nativity"")Barthel Beham(""Vanitas""),Martin Schaffner(""Epitaph of Sebastian Welling""),Lucas Cranach the Elder(""Charity"") and Franz Zimmerman(""Lucretia""),among others.Netherlandish painters from the Renaissance Period with quality paintings included;Marcellis Coffermans,Jan Massys(""Flora"")Jan Provost(""Last Judgement""),Jan Gossaert(""Crucifixion""),and Hans Van Cleve the Third(""Tower of Babel""),among others.Although German and Netherlandish Renaissance Period paintings are emphasized at this art museum,I also saw fine Renaissance Period Italian paintings by Francesco Francia(""Virgin and Child Holding Globe""),Sebastiano di Bartolo Mainardi(""Virgin and Child with John the Baptist""),and Paris Bordone(""Fountain of Bathsheba"").The Kunsthalle's collection of Italian Art is relatively small in comparison to their German,Netherlandish,Dutch,and French paintings.I also appreciated the way the works of Art were arranged,the labeling of works of Art in English for the benefit of foreign visitors,and the helpfulness of its staff."
2,"Welcome to the Auswanderermuseum BallinStadt in Hamburg aka museum about emigrantion.First of all: I will not join the overall praise for this museum. Now, 3 days after I visited it, I still think the quality of the exhibition is pretty mixed.I visited it with friends, both fluent in English and German, and we switched languages depending on which seemed to get us quicker through, because the museum was pretty crowded on the day of our visit.We both had intermediate to advanced knowledge of German history and emigration waves from Germany. I don't know how much you would get our of the exhibition if you are just searching for information where your ancestors are from. That's because the exhibition is pretty inconsistent. Albeit, the general layout makes sense: Situation in Germany and Eastern Europe  Migration waves  Destinations - the development of the ships and the ship passage  Entering the new country (with a special focus on Ellis Island)  Immigration Countries other than the USA/Canada (Brazil, Australia)  famous immigrants who've made it.In another building the history of the BallinStadt is told, with the situation which led to the building of the barracks, their short-lived fate from 1901-1914 and the seemingly even shorter time between WW I and WW II. Plus the story about the back-then CEO of HAPAG, the shipping company that invented ship cruises and got big by shipping immigrants over the Big Pond.About the flaws in the concept:English vs. German:Everything is labelled in English in German, but the German label dominate, the English is always a bit shorter and layouted in a smaller font.Bigger picture vs. individual story:In the beginning you are confronted with six individuals, which should guide you through the exhibition and tell you their story. They literally tell you their story, which might be longer with the one and quicker with the other. Unfortunately you cannot skip  when you dialled the wrong language, you have to wait until they are finished. On crowded days, you have to stand in line, there are only two earphones per puppet, and you can dial only one language at a time for both earphones.And in the end you find out the six individuals don't really guide you through. You just see them back at the end of the exhibition, then they tell you what their life is like not that they are away from home for a couple of month or years. There is no alternative way to find out about their fate, you either wait and here or you don't find out about them.During the different stages of the migration, there are different individuals who show up and just present one piece of information, you don't get informed what their background is, et cetera. So if they already put such an efford in telling an individual's story, why don't they use it to describe the different stages of emigration better?History of BallinStadtThere is a lot of pictures and exhibition objects which are not labelled, and you might only get the meaning of it later on, if you get it.Conclusion:Ok, we learned a lot, and I think for kids it might be funny to run through a ship which changes from early 18th century to early 20th century within a few meters. But there is a lot that is forbidden to touch (not a good idea with kids). The fact that a lot of exhibition objects are not labelled and you might learn to know what it was waaayyy later is annoying.The entrance fee is 12 EUR, which is not cheap. As the museum is not publicly funded, it is heavily sponsored, f.e. by Ancestry.com. This is a bit ironic, because the digitalization of the archieves is publicly funded, so it is a strange kind of private-public partnership."
4,Where does one hear the ships already better? Where does one see one more dog? Where does one see more Punks (there are it still) and infants on a heap? Where do the people wait so patiently and in a long line for their fried sausage? In the beach pearl! Directly at the beach of the Elbe stop of everything is possible. And n the winter: country under. Also beautifully!
4,"Very very good burrito. Dead friendly staff, quick service, delicious burritos and good beer. Only slight criticism is the lack of cheese topping, but can't fault them on the filling. Good price too. I'm definitely becoming a regular. Going to have to try the steak burrito pretty damn soon."
3,Fast takeout. A little pricey. Bf got a Bulgogi burger and he absolutely loved it. I got some edamame. Very delicious but could have been larger portions for the price. There seemed to be plenty of space outside for eating but the place was very popular and busy so all the tables were full. Vegan menu was fairly limited. Overall would recommend for adventurous eaters who aren't starving
4,"A Kebab joint unlike any other I've encountered setting a whole new bench mark as far as kebab shops go Firstly a proper dine in Kebab shop?! Unreal! Being use to ordering my Kebab from a corner stall after a big night out, consuming the contents either on a street bench or as I walk home, this place resembles more of a comfortable Turkish bar/cafe then any kebab shop back in Sydney.The place obviously has quite a following with it's tables still full and lively even on a late Tuesday night. The servings are huge and very tasty!!! Ordering a small plate delivered enough food to comprise three meals for me let alone one! The highlight for me was being able to order a nice cold one with my meal-The fact that I can now enjoy both a Beer and a Kebab simultaneously and at the beginning of a night out rather then as the end of a big one has definitely secured a loyal customer out of me A Kebab shop that serves Beer is just plain genius!! If only they did this in Australia."
3,"We enjoyed an early dinner at Campo da Franco on a recent Saturday evening. The weather was great, so we sat outdoors in their patio, which despite being adjacent to a major thoroughfare, was fairly quiet and calm. The staff is super-friendly; we mostly communicated in German, but they were there to help us in English when we stumbled. The crew seems legit Italian, and they do a nice job. I had the eponymous Pizza Campo (arugula, spicy salami, cherry tomatoes, Parmesan), and it was delicious. Also had some insalata caprese on the side, which was very fresh and tasty. My family also enjoyed their meals, and we had some nice wines by the glass to go with everything. All in all, a great experience with good food. We'll be back."
4,"Entirely unique, weird, fun, and a must-see for Hamburg visitors with a few days to fill. This is what happens when you give a group of manic model train enthusiasts a few million to play with, and the results go from hilarious to stunning. Expect to spend a few hours on your feet, and not notice them go by. Usually quite crowded, so booking in advance for a specific time slot is recommended. A little restaurant/café with cute booths that simulate train seating is on the premises, so if you need to refuel you'll be set. Right next door to the over-the-top-animatronic-fest that is the Hamburg Dungeon, so it makes sense to pair those, especially if the weather's bad."
4,"You'll never be disappointed with what ever you choose at Herr Max! They serve lots and lots of great cake.. My fave is Cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. Their cheesecake is the best cheesecake ever! The tanginess from cheese and lime is well balanced with the moist sweet biscuit base. And the chocolate mousse cake is not too sweet, so you can enjoy the richness of the chocolate. 3 layers of pure joy!"
2,"This place was mobbed when we ventured in on a cold Tuesday night in March. We had been looking for somewhere to a have quick drink with a decent atmosphere and it fitted the bill. Named after a gangster from America during the 1920's the place had photos of him everywhere. It was was also dark and moody looking, set up to be like a cocktail bar that a mobster might frequent.In terms of a place to have a drink this could well have been a 4 star as it was busy, had some atmosphere, attentive service and a good array of drink options. For two main reasons for me it is only a three star. Firstly they allow smoking inside. For me it is now a very much out dated practise that no way should be allowed inside bars. Secondly the drinks were a bit on the pricey side working out at 27 euros for three. So works out about £7 a drink, which is pricey compared to other places in the city. If these two things don't bother you I reckon you will love it here. Decent cocktail bar, certainly busy on a Tuesday night."
4,"Fantastic restaurant. The food and service are exquisite, but served in a lively and warm atmosphere that could teach stuffy restaurants a thing or two.  The sushi was fabulous and the sashimi platters really zinging with freshness. Great combinations  of flavours from classic to fusion and  great portions, couldn't believe it was all for us to eat. Great for couples or for business entertaining and  can't wait to go back next time in hamburg."
3,"A very trendy place. A big plus is that they have homemade patties and you can choose what kind of bun you want. I whish that the patties tasted a bit more tho. They are in need of salt and peppar. I have only had take-away and the concept is great! You choose your type of burger, then buns and side orders and when we waited for the food we got free beverages. I have never eaten at the restauran but I would say it is worth a pop-in."
3,"Mmmm, burritos! Big, filling, yummy, vegan and vegetarian burritos (they have beef/poultry too but I've never had one of those).It might not be the best burritos in the world, but they get the job done. :)The wait is always long, but the beers are always cold so who cares? We return every time we're in Hamburg, sometimes twice in a day..."
3,"We went here for a work lunch. We got a table pretty quick. The waitress was very attentive. The food came very fast which is good if you have to be back at work. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there were some weird small black specks in my drink which may have been dirt or dust... I'm not sure... all the food look great and tasted great. The dessert was my favorite - the tiramisu is amazing!!!! They have a garden out the back which is probably wonderful in summer. Overall good food, good prices, good service!"
1,"Disappointment. Seems I ordered the wrong food I guess. I paid €15 for the Lasagna with a side salad... Yuck. The lasagna was only pasta with the color red, no meat and only a slice of cheese on the top. Plus it smelled and tasted like fish. Do yourself a favor and order breakfast there. I even waited a day to write this to see if I would change my mind...."
3,This is a fabulous small neighborhood Italian restaurant with all fresh food and a wonderful atmosphere.  On the board as you come in are the local paper accolades so you know that it is extremely popular locally.  We were there on a weeknight and it was crowded although we didn't wait long for a table.  They were wonderful and very helpful even though they didn't speak english very well.  All the locals seemed to know each other and appear to frequent the place a lot.  All were very friendly to us as well.  All together a fabulous experience.  The food and bread was wonderful and the prices were reasonable.
4,"Great Chinese food all round. As already mentioned by the other reviewers, the DimSum are excellent and the best in town. The Duck Rice is also very good. All in all I would say that this place wins it by a mile on the Chinese Food front. It's like many of the places in Asia, the decor is a little tacky, but the food is great. This place is essentially like a short trip to Asia and back!"
0,Worst service i have ever experienced ... 20 minutes wait just to order... 30 minute wait to get food... 20 minute wait to get another drink... 15 minutes still waiting for the guy to deign to bring us the check so we can ask for a to go box... Which will take another hour!! He passes us by to clean a table while were trying to ask for a check... He just walks away... The food is crap as well ... But this seems to be a theme in this city...
4,"OMG, the best Chinese food ever. They have a Chinese menu, and the food there is absolutely authentic. We ordered boiled spicy beef and sour bean with minced pork. It is soooo tasty that I want to lick the dish. The restaurant is not big. We came in 7pm on Sunday, and it was already full. We wait about 20 mins to get a table. And the food didn't disappoint us. I have also ordered several take-away here. The food is also great. Definitely recommend it to others."
4,"Nice little spot in a beautiful old Hamburg neighborhood. Part ""Cheers,"" part New York neighborhood bistro. German staples and a few goodies like eggs and potatoes.They don't open until Noon (2p on Sunday). Perfect for brunching after a night on the Reeperbahn!FYI, they are very protective of their larger tables when it's busy. If you are one or two, they won't seat you at a four-top. Yours truly is traveling solo this trip and got relegated to the tiny bar. No complaints, as that's my preference rather than being the lonely dude at a big table.  Also a good perch for people watching and composing pithy prose."
3,Delicious taps and other full entrees too. It's a small but busy restaurant. A little cramped but since the food was good it did not matter. Good find
2,"The new Jim Block is really shiny looking, probably due to it's position next to the Alster where everything seems shiny and expensive. Thankfully the burgers are the same price as everywhere else. I should mention for those unfamiliar with the Jim Block franchise that they're a sort of classier fast-food burger joint. You get a real plate and cutlery and you can choose a beer as part of the meal-deal. The burgers are better than standard fast food burgers, and the fries are pretty decent too. If you want a quick burger I'd recommend this place. However, in the context of Jim Block restaurants, this one is super-busy. They don't seem to have any more staff though, and do the service really suffers. Last night there were 5 staff and only 2 people ahead of me in the line, but it still took me 10 minutes to get served. I shudder to think how long it'd take with a line out of the door (I have seen this)."
4,This is one of very few specialist coffee shops in Hamburg and they do a perfect job.... Their 'First Love' espresso is prob the best origin blend espresso I've tasted
2,"We came here with great expectation, since it was mentioned by yelp and also some fellow Chinese as one of the best in Hamburg. From a Chinese point of view the restaurant is fair, but doesn't meet our expectation. The highlight is the spicy beef soup, and the water spinach (通心菜) is good. The sour soup fish (酸菜鱼) is fair. The spicy duck （干锅鸭） is not fresh, and the cucumber (拍黄瓜) is a total joke. The service is disaster. The lady is  rude and inpatient. She won't take a second to explain anything, keep complaining if you didn't order fast enough. She has only 4 tables to attend! But no one come here for service anyway. In general, it was an okay place. That leaves us to wonder what we can still expect from Hamburg..."
3,"Very good food. Went late on a Saturday night and they served us until late. Great staff, very warm."
3,"Pretty much all bars on Hamburger Berg are the same, and Roschinsky's is no exception to that! Packed to the rafters every Thursday till Sunday, lots of drunks, students, and sweating people jumping up and down. Good stuff."
4,"Came here with my (admittedly meat-loving and very skeptic) boyfriend and we both really liked it! We had the ""cheese"" baked nachos to start and liked it a lot. We also both really enjoyed our main dishes - I had the mr. Bean burrito and my boyfriend the Vitaly burger with the ""beyond meat"" patty. So good! I also tried a bit of the burger patty and was shocked that it's vegan as it tastes exactly like meat. This place is good enough to impress even your meat-loving friends. Give it a try!"
4,"Came here for a very relaxing Sunday brunch with my man! Their menu changes daily as they use the freshest ingredients so don't be surprised if you can't find a menu!When you first enter, it may look a bit small but head on back past the kitchen where there's more seating and outdoor seating as well. We sat in the back in some comfy chairs. The decor of the place is so charming! Our waitress quickly greeted us and told us the daily specials and her recommendations. She was really nice and attentive! We ended up ordering the breakfast meal for one and added an order of their house made pancakes. I ordered a tea and was pleasantly surprised when the waitress popped out into the garden to pick fresh mint leaves for my tea!We started with a refreshing bowl of yogurt with fresh fruits and musli. Then our breakfast meal came which had everything you'd want for a brunch. There were various cold cuts of meats to choose from, cheese, caprese salad bites, some cucumber slices, olives, grapes, and jams and spreads for everything! We also got a basket of bread and a fresh hard boiled egg. Shortly after, our pancakes arrived and they looked fantastic! There was a bit of fruit jam drizzled on it with fresh mint and a chocolate spread and a maple sauce as accompaniments. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and tasted divine! Super fluffy and not eggy at all. Adding the mounds of the chocolate spread to it also helps with the deliciousness :)All in all, This was probably one of the better brunch experiences we have had this far being here. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are reasonable and the staff is also super friendly. Our brunch only cost us about 20€ so we'll be coming back soon to try more daily specials for sure!"
4,"Exceptional coffee, cigars, brandy, port, long drinks, short drinks and cocktails. Great for sitting outside and watching tge world walk (and drive) past."
3,"Delicious burritos! Oh my goodness so good!As a Californian it is extremely difficult to find decent (let alone authentic) Mexican food in Germany but this place did it. I mean, who knew you could find nopales in Germany? Extra nice touch with the small religious shrine behind the counter and Mexican wrestler wall paper, it was like stepping into a burrito shop in San Diego.The beans, the rice, the pico de gallo, perfect.Not giving the full 5 stars because it is a small space where people tend to linger long past the end of their meal making finding a seat (or waiting for one) a hassle. Much, much better than Dolores in Berlin. Still, I'd come back here ASAP!"
4,Very nice coffee and cakes. It's a tight squeeze in there and a popular place. The Japanese filtered coffees are too pricy but the normal coffees are yummy and worth it :)
3,"The best place for a hamburger in Hamburg.Always busy mainly because of the location on Jungfernsteig but also down to the speed, service and quality of what's on offer.Great value, cheaper and a lot nicer than a McDonalds!As a tip on the best time to come i would suggest Sundays as you can get served within a few minutes and eadily find somewhere to sit."
3,"There's a reason this Hamburg Chinese restaurant has such a large Chinese, Thai, Filipino clientele; it's the real deal done well.  Reasonably priced lunch specials, good portions, tasty food, and comfortable seating are the pros.  Don't let some of the surly staff or sublevel dwelling deter you.  You're bound to leave feeling you have achieved preiswert!"
3,"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I came in during the downtime and got my burger relatively quickly. The atmosphere was relaxing and the burger itself was quite juicy and full of flavor. The fries were pretty fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside - always nice, and having mayonnaise and ketchup for free was a plus. The milk shake I ordered was alright and I was all in all pleased with everything."
3,"Had a very relaxing evening there. The service was professional and friendly. The wines that I tried an the drinks my friend had were all good. The munchies were very good (sweet potatoe fries and a flamkuchen). When the weather turns wet or colder, the inside is spacious and well designed. It's next to a museum and not in a very scenic area of Hamburg (of which there many...). But still very nice. I highly recommend it."
3,"I actually had a nice day here at Hagenbecks. The only thing that made me a bit sad was the elephant display. They were reaching out for the apples that you can give to them, but there are these wires that keep them from falling off the edge of the animal encasement (which a big ditch separates them from where the people stand and watch) and they lean up against it to eat, and I can see the markings on their skin from all the leaning into the wire cables and that made me feel a bit guilty feeding them. The monkey display is very cool, you get to see Mandrills which are so beautifully colored but be careful, their hands like to grab anything that comes close to the cage (i.e camera cases, jackets, purses, etc...) and once they grab, it can be a struggle so if you happen to take a private back area tour, just keep this tip in mind!!!The orangoutangs are also very sweet, they have a big dome covering over their exhibit during colder winter months to keep them warm, but during Summer it is wide open and you can see them hopping around and dragging their blankets, playing with one another.  They seem quite happy!Overall, this is quite a nice local Zoo.  Basically when this zoo was build, the concept was not to ""cage"" animals but to let them roam in an open environment, so they use moats here instead of bars.  They have quite a display of animals and in some displays, they even mix animals like they are naturally done in the wild, but of course he does not mix hyenas with zebras! A nice trip for a local to walk around during the day and for a tourist who has time to explore outside of the main Hamburg areas....."
4,"I've been here multiple times over a few years, and never fail to be impressed.  Most recently for lunch, the efficiency, quality, and charm - - at an incredible price - - is something just jaw-dropping.  Nice thin crust, ingredients with abandon and flair,  remarkable service, fun vibe - - Luigi's continues to blow me away.  The experience can vary depending on whether you get there when it is packed (which it generally is) or you can breeze in and get a table (worth timing your visit to make this a possibility).   But no matter what, and no matter when, you will have some super tasty pizza, and a vivid experience."
4,Most amazing place! Great personale and service from the get go! Food soooo delicious -nothing less! Go people! Go!!! Remember only German credit card or cash!Denmark
4,"Absinthe is certainly something different. Run by a couple who had been ""talking about setting up an Absinthe bar for 6 years"", they got around the legal issues of selling such poison a year ago, and are now living the dream. There's something very odd about this place. The ambiance is almost out of a vampire film, and quaffing copious quantities of the green stuff only amplifies it. The selection of spirits is extremely comprehensive. I would guess they basically have everything, and serve it in style. You could also take a beer here, but why would you? If I had to pick holes (apart from the ones in the walls!), I'd be that the seating is not conducive to curling up and going to sleep. I'd imagine this is deliberate! 5/5."
4,"If you are into kebabs, then this place is a recommenation. Simply because of the very high turnover - surprising at this location - you can be assured that the food is always fresh. I found the service really fast. Prices are not dramatically on the cheap side, but worth it."
3,"A nice place for a decent dinner that does not kill off your retirement account. The pizza's are thin crust and huge (definitely large enough for two hearty eaters. The salads are also nice, and on a nice summer evening their outdoor seating is very nice. Enjoy!"
4,"Best place to eat turkish food around Altona. Very good quality, reasonable prices, friendly and fast waiters. Daily lunch is 5 EUR. I just know this place during the day. If you park you car outside, pay the necessary fees, there are always policemen around!"
2,"Met with some friends here last week for some HAPPY HOUR cocktails.As far as I recall Happy Hour starts at 10:30pm / 22:30h.The prices for a Jumbo cocktail was about half the normal price which would be around 5-7€ depends on what you order. So normally it's around 12-14€ or something.Well the cocktails are really average. So it's still ok. While I was waiting at the bar, I already had in mind it wouldn't be the worlds best, since the best cocktails are from Brazil... well at least I like to think that way :DI have no idea about the food, but I know they have a very large brunch everyday for 10€ which is really good but you should still go to CAFE MAY if you want cheap and great brunch. So I wouldn't mind to try this place.And the location is really something. They have a large patio and the interior is neat and clean.I would come again for the location and try the food here."
2,Discent burger restaurant whom also serve a salads - the Cesar salad comes without any chicken so you have to order that on the side (well most of the salads is without protein :-))Would have loved to taste there dessert unfortunately there where no hot chocolate left when we finished our main course. They have home made drinks (non alcoholic) which is very good.
4,"This is not your typical Turkish German restaurant or donair place (although they do serve a great variety of donairs): great quality food, very friendly staff who visibly care about the food they cook fresh, nice seating both in- and outdoors - and all this for a very reasonable price. Impressed."
3,"I absolutely loved this place. Was in Hamburg on business and was trying to check out some local restaurants that were also trendy. Went with 4 of my colleagues and we had such a wonderful time - the linguini was fantastic and the wine (Nero) was impeccable. We especially enjoyed the two waiters who were warm, helpful and full of life. Charming experience!"
4,"Most favorite Italian in Hamburg. Try the Vitello Tonnato- amazing, and the pizza's are delicious! When the meal is coming to an end- be ready for a couple bottles and shot glasses to appear at your table with a friendly smile... The owners/servers know how to party and love making you feel like you're in their own home!"
4,"Super. Super. Super awesome.Showed up shortly after opening to avoid the crowds. The only downside is that the coat check wasn't open yet so I was wandering around with my outer layers balled up.I loved all the detail, the scenes within scenes, the Elbephilharmonic that opens up, the airport with departing model planes, and the full on cruise ship at the end. Like some cheesy metaphor, there is tons to see and enjoy if you only take the time to notice. I went alone and spent nearly three hours here and made full use of the cafe because apparently walking around and looking at little things makes me hungry. Give yourself plenty of time to come, see, and enjoy."
3,"La Sepia is located at the Sternschanze stop in Hamburg, which is filled with a bunch of hipster restaurants and boutiques. I liked the location cause La Sepia is right next to the Schanze's Sofa Bar (Zöe), so I can easily just walk on over after dinner to relax on a nice vintage sofa and enjoy some late night drinks. I had dinner on the night of a World Cup game so everyone was outside and all the restaurants were showing the game. It was really an event to see.The complimentary garlic dip at the beginning was okay, and a little bit on the saltier side, but when you're hungry and waiting on your food it doesn't necessarily matter. My boyfriend and I had the White Hauswein with our dinner. They brought our a bottle of it, and payment was calculated based on how much we actually drank, which I found to be liberating. I had the Paella Meeresfrüchte, which I definitely could've shared. The main problem with La Sepia is the wait and service. We waited for our food for over an hour and every time we asked about it, the server said he would go check on it and let us know, but he never came back. This happened about 3 times in one sitting. They would avoid us and it was just ridiculous. My boyfriend, who is a local, said that that was the norm of La Sepia. Make sure your BS tolerance is high the night you visit La Sepia. Otherwise, I would just come eat during lunch time to avoid the crowd."
4,"Love this place ~ reminds me of street food in Asia. Great food, friendly staff, quick service, must try if you are looking for great Vietnamese food :0)"
1,"This bar is prety hit and miss and there was a line to get in last night which seemed a bit silly as it""s OK but not all that. I've had some great nights here when the weather was warmer first arriving in Hamburg and I've had some lame nights here too. Over-crowded full of American guys trying to hit on my friends and annoying us, the music being pure cheese at best. Plus side the bartenders are friendly and I've got free shots and drinks here before."
3,"They just finished renovating and have a whole second floor for eating now! It's a great place to grab a quick meal before a movie at the Savoy. Fast and quick, but still pretty tasty. I don't want to know why it's so cheap, but I'll take it."
4,"Wow, super entertaining..... For 30minutes, water fountains dance along to music accompanied by a range of lights to change the colour of the water..... Whether you are a tourist or a local, would definitely recommend popping by one evening for this completely free event in planten u blomen park"
3,"Very friendly waiters and pleasant atmosphere. Some Dim Sum were tasty, some you need to get used to. But if you didn't try out Dim Sum before, this place should be a good start."
3,"Danmark Snack is basically just hotdogs and burgers, but mostly hotdogs. It's a very unassuming little place, and so for the past year I'd always just walked on by to one of the other fast-food places. I had noticed that it's well reviewed here by German Qypers, and so when leaving the Reeperbahn S-Bahn hungry last night I popped in. The place is basically a hotdog factory, but they also have a few burgers if you want one of those. I went for a cheeseburger and it hit the spot. Not too big, not too small. it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was better than most of what is on offer at other nearby establishments."
4,"I found this roastery yesterday, led by my nose when I was in the vicinity. The roaster gave me a personal tour of the facilities and I had a very good (and amazingly inexpensive; all drinks are 1,- EUR) Capuccino in the café in the upper floor."
4,"FANTASTIC! Loved it! My husband and I went there for lunch about 2 weeks ago and we were both very pleased with our pizzas. I was able to get a vegan pizza, he was able to get a meat pizza. Both of us gobbled up the whole thing."
3,"Great place. However cooks do not know the difference between medium rare and medium. Tried to order medium rare like 5 times in  different Otto places, they always brought me medium/well done. Overall food it great, brioche bun is yum, truffle Mayo - thumbs up, stuff is nice too. And yes, they have great selection of craft beers!"
4,You want to eat great steak/food? Go here. I visited the Delta Bistro twice already and each night was an awesome experience. Try the tomahawk steak (800g). 60 Eur for that gorgeous piece of meat but it's worth every cent! The service is quick and friendly. 5 stars well deserved!
4,"Love the food, super taste, fresh and well priced. Good service. I wonder if they have home delivery. My family loves this place. From their grilled chicken, I make more dishes quickly at homeyummy food. Must try."
3,"Die Pizzeria is a family favorite for us, partially because it's so close to home, but also because their food is really quite good, the ambience is casual but nice, and the staff is really friendly.The pizzas are an extremely thin crust, cooked perfectly. Because the crust is so thin, the margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella) is probably my favorite. They have chili oil available, which I usually put on to give it a little kick. I've tried a bunch of the other pizzas, too, and they're good, too. They also have a handful of pasta options, which I've tried a few times. By far my favorite pasta is the linguine aglio, olio, e scampi (garlic, oil, and shrimp), which comes with a heap of arugula on top, and just a really great flavor overall. There are soft drinks, wines by the glass and bottle, and beer on tap. A few of their wines by the glass are excellent, and reasonably priced. I always get the feeling that I'm being slightly overcharged at Die Pizzeria, but I think that's just the Eppendorf surcharge (everything is probably 20% more expensive than it should be). When it's warm enough (or when the locals decide it's warm enough, they also have seating outdoors. They'll even set up a TV for big sporting events (World Cup, etc)."
3,"Prior to my trip out to Hamburg, I thought hamburgers might have originated here!  Anyways, though that isn't the case, I am so glad I found Jim Block!  I had it bookmarked for a cheap, quick, and pleasing eat.  I came here for a very late lunch/early dinner with my boss on a Sunday afternoon.I got the Mushroom and cheeseburger meal, so it came with fries and a drink.  I decided on bottled water as opposed to soda.  The plate was huge and was about €9.  Our orders were served fast.  The burger was messy and covered with a lot of mushrooms and the cheese was perfectly melted.  They have their own signature sauce put on it and it also came with shredded lettuce.  The fries were crisp and I saw many others opted to get a baked potato or side of bread instead.  They also have the option for bunless in which you just get served the meat with toppings.  Her falafel burger was shaped into a patty and she was very pleased with it.  My meal was so big that I couldn't finish it all.  There's mostly communal seating at this very busy location.  And it's kinda cool to see how fast food is different in Europe, as they use silverware!  I would recommend Jim Block for a quick and pleasing meal.  They don't have salads but there's something for a beef eater, chicken eater and the veggie eater."
4,"I am a long time customer of Panthera Rodizio in Hamburg, I usually go every time I am in Germany.The food is fantastic! When ordering, simply ask for Rodizio and skip the Salad bar  you don't have to have the salad unless you want it.I admit the service is slow at times, but having 20 or so staff serving a 300 cover restaurant thats packed and new customers arriving as soon as the ones that have finished, I feel the service is good.The atmosphere is very alive and noisey, which is to be expected. As someone else said, Alsterwasser is like a Shandy, beer watered down with lemonade. There are 2 P.R. in Hamburg. The one in H.H. (Hamburg Harburg) is a bit smaller and the service there is terrible, the main P.R. is near the docks in Hamburg (Hamburg Harfen). They also have one in Bremen, but I don't like this one so much, it's in the railway station (bahnhof)."
4,Second visit here and it is just as good as always. They continuously add new places and delights to make kids and adults giddy.
2,"Maybe I just dreamt that I already reviewed here. Decent location in a nice square by the canal, and popular. The downside is the sometimes painfully slow service, and I've never been overwhelmed by the pasta. I would recommend Rialto, which is just next door. It is stylish though."
4,"An intimate wine bar with a lovely menuA short convenient walk from an M2 bus stop, I had a very pleasant evening in this wine bar which seems to have a very dedicated local clientele.  I had a salad and soup--both were extremely tasty and the recommended wine to accompany was superb.  The staff was friendly and kind and welcoming to an American on a business trip."
4,"I've been coming here for like 11 years now.Hands down the best Greek place in the world!The prices are very fair, all the waiters are very nice and there is always loads of ouzo ;) I have always been bringing new people here over the last decade and everyone always came back for more!If you are looking for awesome bifteki, nice gyros and tasty zaziki - this is the place to go!But always, if you wanna come here reserve a table in advance, this is one of the busiest places in Eimsbüttel!"
2,"Disappointing for an Aussie who had hoped for a more healthy version like back home. Also the burrito couldn't be picked up due to size and how runny the insides were. Slow service (only one guy in the kitchen during lunchtime!) but I'm getting used to that in Germany. They mean well and seem nice & friendly but kinda missed the mark for me. Maybe I try the quesadilla next time, most people seemed to order that."
3,"What a strange experience this place was. It's a bar trying to be a dive in one of the richest parts of Hamburg. Weird mix of people: on one hand, the grungy rocker types and at the same time, young yuppies, wearing the standing collars and Burberry scarves. Really odd but at the same time amusing. The staff think they are tougher than they are working in a place like this but it fits the goal of the bar. Really tight quarters when it fills up but the vibe is good. If in the area though, a good place to grab a drink and have a couple laughs. You'll definitely not regret it even if this isn't your thing."
3,"I ate it at 2 a.m., not drunk, and didn't feel like crap! YAY! Great bratwurst and fries, wolfed it down like starving dog and was fully satisfied. Can definitely recommend for the late night munchies or the drunkie munchies, whatever you prefer."
3,Had a very good steak here. Argentinian rump steak done perfectly.
4,Xiao Xang Garten is a really wonderful restaurant situated in Elmsbüttel in Hamburg. The staff is very much considerate with the diners and very friendly and professional. We were invited by German friends who made us discover this most pleasant place. All the dishes we had were excellent. We strongly and heartily recommend this Chinese restaurant which is very quiet and intimate.Michel and Marie Moulin Lyon France
4,"One of the nicest locations in Hamburg to eat, drink and listen to music. The old LighthouseShip is placed near the Überseebrücken and is painted red. You will find it. You can choose: Sitting outside on deck an drink a bear or eat something or go down into the the engineroom, where a nice bar is placed. There you hear often Live Jazz Music. I think it was on mondays. A few rooms are even a small hotel on board.Enjoy"
2,"This is just another bar on the Reeperbahn that you'll never remember the name of after you stumble out in a drunken haze. The only reason I can remember is that I took a photo! On the weekends it's really busy, loads of mental dancing and drunkenness. On the weekdays they have EUR5 cocktails until midnight - not a bad deal."
3,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a while back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have to like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Recently for example had the coconut milk and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
4,"My new favourite café and a highlight of my Hamburg visit.  Quaint and full of character,  good vibes and chill tunes - this café serves up some amazing homemade cheesecake (highly recommend!). The homemade ice-cream is also bomb! Staff are friendly and informative."
3,"Love the outside sitting area, great view of the warehouses. Nice relaxing and quiet area away from the traffic. Friendly service, and the food tasted good. There was an English menu which was really nice, in the service spoke English as well. Really nice area inside too, but great for it outside sit on a nice night!"
3,"For 21€ that's really a good deal. You will get more food than you can eat: the waffle was excellent, the orange juice freshly pressed and the Brötchen nicely warm. Moreover the place is extremely cozy. The atmosphere really makes the difference! Would totally go again to try a different breakfast option :)"
4,"One very impressive model, amazing animations. I can spend so much time to look all the details."
3,"Very nice, however if you are British and used to hot curries make sure you opt for the hot chilli when they ask you, otherwise the Madras is pretty bland.Also for most people a small box is perfectly enough for lunch."
3,"it is not that easy to find a good brunch place in Hamburg! Glueck & Selig is definately worth going! drinks are a little overpriced if you ask me. dishes are nothing fancy, but very tasty!"
4,"Visit this place for authentic Cantonese Dim Sum, probably the best in town. This manifests itself with 90% of the dining guests being Chinese.The portions have European dimensions, the prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."
3,The Chocoversum is a chocolate museum from the Hachez Company. Our guided tour showed the whole process of chocolate production and we were able to try every step of the process. Furthermore everyone can make an own bar of chocolate. The tour was very informative and interesting. At the end of the tour there is a chocolate shop from Hachez.
4,"OMG! I never thought I will have multiple orgasms in a museum (almost). For everybody whose heartbeat goes up from fast racing cars, it's a must see. Absolutely professional presentation, and even interesting for kids (but you have to watch them constantly so that they don't touch the cars). Toilets, nappy changing room are also top class. Otherwise quiet and relaxed atmosphere, you can take your time to explore the past and present of the fastest racing cars of the world."
4,"This museum is super interesting and was worth every minute of our visit. The guides were super polite and helpful. Our visit consisted of putting yourself in a blind person's shoes; we navigated through a dark room and did everyday activities. To make the visit more lifelike, the guides were seeing-impaired so they have expertise and knowledge for the activity. Everyone was polite, friendly, and had an amazing attitude. I recommend this place for everybody that comes to Hamburg and is looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
3,"I love the french toast with maple syrup and fresh freuit. for 5,00€ i think it is a pretty good deal.I'm tempted to try out the salads but I know that my bill will be a LOT more expensive. but I'm sure it is all very delicious!the place is always PACKED on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/Brunch... if you don't reserve, you might not have a chance.my only disappointment is that they list red velvet cupcakes on their website as a kind of the baked goods, but I've been there several times and they never have them available. :-(  whyyyy?!?!  i would be so many and so often. ;-)"
4,"Love it - possibly in the top 5 of all German restaurants I have ever been to. warm atmosphere, a friendly and fast service, typical French meals, excellent quality and very tasteful food! All that for a price that is easily affordable (33€ the 3 course menu)."
4,"You fancy a steak but also a burger and can't decide which one you want for dinner? Well there you have it: Grinded premium steak meat between two buns -Bombdelicious my friends! And all of that between 9 and 13 bucks. It's the first time i had a burger with dripping blue cheese sauce - tasty! I'm just amazed by the variety of special stuff those burgers come with...one of us had the ""Drunk Ghetto"" with a shot of Vodka (cheers). For all the ""healthy"" ones of us...you can either choose a side of fries OR spinach or ceasar salad. They don't say it specifically on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Oh and for the really tough folks out there, try the Chicken Wings Napalm. But be brave, as it is already saying on the menu ""crazy hot""... it will clear your head in a second and gave my friends, quote ""hallucinations"". I was being a chicken and only had a bite....still needed water though which the waitress already had in stock for us since she saw us puffing.The waitresses were in general very alert.So 5 stars are flying to the bird!"
4,"Hamburg has 3-4 very good steakhouses. Meatery is easily the best. The quality of the meat is amazing, the tartars too and most of the other dishes I've tried. The side dishes are perfectly executed as well (the reblochon potato gratin, the very light onion rings and the mushrooms are to die for ). But the meat is definitely the star, cooked to perfection at the desired level of doneness."
2,"Actually, it was the ratings that lured us here. But it wasn't quite as ""great"" as some of the articles read. At first - yes, the service leaves nothing to be desired. Unobtrusive, but quick, nice and friendly. Questions were answered immediately. Ambience - unfortunately everything was already reserved inside, but there was space in the heated winter garden and in retrospect probably even the better choice.The menu is clearly arranged, in addition there is a laminated, small menu with the ""recommendation"". These dishes of the recommendation are on average a little more expensive.Taste: there is nothing to complain about here. Strong but well balanced. But in total rather mainstream. You miss the kick of the real Italian a bit.Do you get full? Not necessarily - at least for me three small cannelloni are not a real meal. You can't avoid ordering another little something in addition.Drinks: We had a big bottle of water with the wine. For five euros we got a rather chubby-looking blue bottle, sparkling water without any special features, and matching quite chic glasses.The wine consultation was quite ok, considering the not too abundant offer this is not surprising. The chosen Chianti was in any case reasonably priced and despite its longstanding bad reputation it was really very good. Fruity, intense, pleasant tannins. Served in wonderfully large, stylish wine glasses. Price - per dish considered reasonable, but if you want to get full you have to order something extra. Seen in this light, the attractive price is quickly doubled.A thing I really missed - there is NO PORK on the menue!"
1,"A real dissapointment!We had the 400 gr Western Steak today. Inspite of the fact that I had asked the waiter, and he had asked the cook, to make me a steak brown and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, what I got was a rubbery piece of meat, that was cooked a low heat, had no brown crust on the outside, nor was it juicy on the inside, and just not good at all. No way they will get me back here. Friendly service does not help when the food is lousy! What a shame"
4,"Awesome park for a chill time after work and at weekends. There is a huge greenfield, just bring a blanket, some food and you're set. We played viking chess, people asked to join and we had a good time playing viking chess with strangers.Highly recommended!"
2,"Located in the middle of Portuguese block this restaurant didn't necessarily disappointed but really didn't have anything special. Food was ok, prices were ok. Drinks were ..... small. Being a Hamburg restaurant, I expected fresher seafood. Being a Portuguese cuisine, I expected more flair... Was let down on both ends, but it did served as an ok lunch."
4,"If you're looking for traditional northern German food, Brodersen is definitely a good spot! The interior is also traditional and cozy with a nautical theme. The Pannfisch with the Dijon mustard sauce was quite good, and my partner also really enjoyed the Rumpsteak. I think the highlight was however the Bratkartoffeln... crispy yet soft and fried to perfection! Not the cheapest restaurant but for special occasions definitely a good option! Good for tourists visiting hamburg as well."
3,"Great beer, and good selection of dishes to go with it. the staff is friendly and very polite."
4,"This bar is just what the Grindelhof area needed: Hosting a very mixed crowd consisting of mainly students during day-time, at night, the PONY BAR also draws visitors from next door Abaton movie theatre. Honest prices and a good variety of drinks, sweet snacks and music - most of what needs to be said can be found in all the other entries. Here's the clue: Every wednesday night, there's Live-Jazz. Buggy Braune, one of Hamburg's most well known current jazz pianists, hosts a night of Cool and Modern Jazz, Swing, Be- and Hardbop along with his students from the Hamburger Hochschule für Musik und Theater. It's usually a classic jazz trio or quartet. Playing for free, the guys show that it's all about making music. Feel it. If Buggy's off for some other business, some student takes over his Fender Rhodes and puts the keys on fire. Starts at 10:30 p.m. Check ahead for night buses."
4,"Best coffee I have found in Hamburg! I have been in the city for 3 weeks and did an extensive search for the best cappuchino. Stockholm is the clear winner, for taste and presentation. Love it!"
4,"Germans are known around the world for their excellence in engineering and attention to detail, and nowhere is that more effectively on display than Miniature Wunderland. Every last bit of the models is breathtakingly designed, and each section is filled with hidden details and Easter eggs. Some highlights include:* The entire place has a day/night cycle, complete with sunsets, colored lights, and every last car, building, and street lamp lighting up in sync with the cycle.* There's a river in one of the areas that has a remote-controlled boat in it, complete with tides achieved by pumping water in and out of the river in sync with the day/night cycle.* The Hamburg airport has a perfect replica, complete with takeoffs, taxiing, landings, and a working departure/arrival board.* Each display is filled with buttons that cause rocket launches, open buildings, prompt volcanic eruptions, and more!* The roads are full of cars and trucks that actually move and obey traffic lights.You can easily spend hours here ogling over every detail. I lost count of the number of times I said ""wow"" out loud. If you're touring Hamburg, just go. You won't regret it, not even a little."
3,I've always had good food every time I've been here and always very reasonably priced. Today I had a pollack (seelachs) fillet with rice. It was great.
4,"Unglaublich gute Sushi, sogar das vegetarische Sushi mit den 3-4 Stücken tempura-Gemüse finde ich zum niederknien (in anderen Restaurants sind das oft nur Gurkenmaki, die man am liebsten vergessen möchte) Vorweg gab es eine ganz schlicht aussehende gemüsebrühe mit lachsstückchen. Selbst die war ein Gedicht. Mein neuer lieblingsasiate."
4,Honestly a must try if in Hamburg! The burger bowls are to die for. We also had cakes for dessert and they were AMAZING!!! the staff was really friendly too.
4,"A club that looks like a scout hut! A first - but as bad as this concept sounds it's actually pretty good. If I wasn't so damn ill I'd be there tonight. Grüner Jäger means ""Green Hunter"" in German. My good friend in absentia is also a Hunter - so I will take him here when he gets back. The beer is cheap, there are comfy sofas, a big dance floor, regular live music, young crowd, table football upstairs... it's a very decent hangout. Not as stylish as the Sofabar across the road, but more music going on."
3,"Great beer, lively restaurant, and, at least to an American, great tasting German food at a reasonable price. Would definitely visit again."
4,Very friendly staff and great breakfast. It was also fun to learn about the many different brewing methods and to try something new.
4,Good and cheap place to eat kumpir. Great variaty of kumpir. Big sizes and good prices.
3,"Strong cocktails, we loved them. We ordered mai thai and the mystery mojito. Nice ambiance in an early Sunday morning, after a stroll on the harbor. Too bad the terrace is still closed. Staff could be more energetic, but the good cocktails make up for it."
1,"i recommend trying food that is not sushi here. last time i ordered sushi from their lunch menu, i found the tuna not fresh enough to eat raw. if color or smell of sliced fish have changed, it's a sign that it is no longer fresh.the atmosphere is good. the restaurant does not really serve Japanese food, the teriyaki menus they have for lunch use sweet&sour sauce and not teriyaki sauce."
4,So good... one of the best Mexican restaurants in Hamburg! Delicious food and welcoming service.
3,"Preparation takes a while but it's worth to wait. It's  a jumbo tortilla, expect nothing less, make sure you are really, really hungry before you go in :)"
1,"Would love to give them a higher rating but the carrot quiche that we had was TERRIBLE. I have no doubt that because we were the Americans we were subjected to what we were told was ""the last of the quiche"" and ""the only quiche available"" was the carrot quiche. The gentleman ahead of us had ham and the 4 people that came in after us also were given the option of ham, of course they took ham. Awful, awful, awful"
2,"Service is average and the beer is kind of a dissapointment.  Neat location on a canal. Hard to explain the beer;  I had their copper lager which is almost a dunkel but doesn't get to the richness of a dunker, and lacks something if it's trying to be closer to an altbier. The summer lager I had was full of all kinds of spices like coriander, but it was just kind of cloying in flavor.Had the flatbread pizzas, which were great; vegetarian options are here, and you can make some stuff vegan."
3,"I love their lunch meals. I go from time to time with my work colleagues and we enjoy the meals there. Normally I order a meal which consists of fried mixed vegetables, rice and kebab meat. The value for the price is great."
4,"I am a HUGE fan of ramen so when this place came up as a new business in Hamburg on my feed, I couldn't resist going there for dinner and checking it out. I wasn't disappointed!This place is already uber popular! I got there about 6:30 and there was already a queue waiting to sit. Ended up waiting about 20 mins to get in and this was a Tuesday evening. I can't imagine what the wait must be on weekends. Worth knowing: if you arrive and there's a queue, you still need to go in and put your name down on the waiting list. Even when I left round 20:30, there was still a queue!I got edamame beans to start off with. They were well salted and tasty. The portion is huge for a starter. I would say these are enough beans for 3 . Next I got the Nitamago Wakame Miso Ramen. They have 3 bases on offer for their ramen: miso, shoyu and shio. They also all come with certain toppings; viewable on the menu and the difference between them tends to lie in the additional toppings. I was glad that they include a naruto on it; gives good colour and naruto is quite tasty.The best part of a ramen to me is the soup base and this base was amazing. Not as spicy(chilli) as I would have liked but this is something I've slowly finally come to grips with in Germany; I find the average spicy level here less than mild. Thankfully they provide additional chili to add, its called house spice  and is essentially a chilli oil. With the right amount of this added, the base was just right. Soft noodles and good portions of vegetables rounded it all up. Awesome ramen! This may just be one of my new favorite spots in hamburg. I'll absolutely be back"
3,"Greatest bun bo hue! Beefy broth with a little kick to it, but not too much. Comes with bean sprouts on the side. Yummy! If I lived here, this would be the place to get my fix. Skip the prawn spring rolls though, pretty boring and flavorless. Tra da tea good but a little pricy."
3,"We went there with 7 other people, of whose 2 greeks.Very good greek food. Good quality/price ratio :) Service was good and fast.Very noisy though, and the porc is really dry. Get some tzatziki with it :D"
2,"Beach clubs as beach clubs go, just stopped in for an after-work gig and it was relatively empty. Filled up quite fast though. Decent selection of grill stuff, booze and lots of seating actually not in the sand. Sweet location, nice that it's in the neighborhood and don't have to trek all the way down to the river to hit up a Strandbar."
3,"A favorite Döner spot!  But you must know my history with Döner.  First, I cannot pronounce it.  Try as I might, now over a few years and many different coaches, I cannot say the word without sounding like a Northeastern American, which I am not.  Second, I tried Döner in Berlin, some say the capitol of Döner, first in 2006.  Despite all of my American friends enthusiastic and sometimes overkill approach to this food object, I did not like it.  Therefore, I did not try it again until about 2 years ago.  Still, I could not adjust to the taste, especially with such yucky tastes springing up in my tastebud memories.  But finally, I was convinced to try the skewers, and loved them.  I must admit the portions are too big, but now at least I try my best to get through them.Now I live with Döner experts.  They can tell you all the best places here in Hamburg AND Berlin.  They will tell you waiting in line for that one super crazy popular spot in Berlin is, well, not really worth it with all the selection available for Döner.  And I was eating with them at this restaurant.  Öz Review: It is fresh.  The restaurant is clean.  The food is great.  The selection of dishes is traditional, and everyone I have tried is great.  Suggestions: Order dessert, you will be more than pleasantly surprised. Lesson:  Even if you do not like something after a few tries, if friends of yours INSIST that you will love it THIS time, give it a try."
4,"The Rathaus is their city hall, but you wouldn't think so with how grand and big it is!  The architecture is truly breathtaking.  I was surprised to see that it was open on a Sunday.  My boss and I went in before closing to look around and just awe.  Apparently you can take a tour, but we didn't know this and opted for a quick ""free"" self-tour.  Loved the back area as well.It's in the heart of the city center and is worth a visit!"
0,"Consistently embarrassingly poor service. Definitely not recommended. Food was very good, but the servers/staff were so incredibly bad. It wasn't even worth it. I can forgive rushed service, but running around like crazed lunatics and throwing attitude doesn't fly. Very disappointing. Lame. Just plain stupid."
4,bestice creamevertry snickers!! It was incredible and I would go there any time. Little expensive but totally worth it
3,Amazing potatoes!! Definitely try the chilli and mediterranean one! The service was not the friendliest but the food is truly great and the place as such is also friendly
3,"If you have ever been to a Sausalitos Bar before this one will not really be any different, excpet it is much bigger than any other I have been to before. It has a huge first floor and a smaller second floor. The cocktails happy hour is every day. You get a Jumbe cocktail for the price of a regular. The food is great especially if you are a mexican food lover. It is located in the Chille house which is in the back of the Moenkenbergstrasse. Every thursday they organize afterwork parties very very nice.cheers"
4,Best Döner in Hamburg !
3,"Wanted to come here for some time and finally had a chance to stop in. First off, and most importantly, the coffee is damn good. We had large cappuccinos and both us had some cake. One was a brownie type thing with white cream somehow on top and the other was a double-chocolate mousse type thing. Basically, we were complimenting the coffee the whole time and really enjoyed it. Strong flavored with just the right amount of whipped milk and really well balanced. I'm super anal about coffee and have a top-of-the-line machine at home and buy good coffee which I grind myself. This is the first place in Hamburg where I would say the coffee is comparable or better to what I can make for myself at home. The cake on the other hand was pretty good but not amazing. My brownie thing was a bit too sweet. The chocolate mousse thing was kind of bland. Unfortunately, I found the sizing also on the small side. I don't like when you get a piece of cake that is half a kilo but when it's tiny I feel scammed a bit. The sizing needs to be increased a bit. I also found the crowd a bit odd in terms of it basically being Schanzen yuppies but they're easily zoned out and I liked the room and atmosphere in general. Plus it was sunny and you can sit nicely outside in front of the door. Anyway, do come and try this place out if coffee is your thing."
4,"A small piece of jungles in the middle of Planten and Blumen. Exciting, if you are big fan of flora und fauna. Otherwise this place is not really big - two tropical rooms and one filled with cactuses. I was attracted mainly to cactus part of the garden. Basically you can get trough in like 10 min. But its entry free, so if you are in Planten und Blumen you should definitely give this place a try."
4,Fantastic food and atmosphere. Leave enough time to get through all the yummy dishes. Probably a good idea to make a reservation!
2,"It's expensive for the quality they are offering but I guess you have to pay also for the location. The wine was nice but the food quite tasteless. We just ordered a mozzarella salat for the two of us and well, it was cute and ok but not at al for two persons. It is a fine restaurant if you want mostly enjoy the location."
0,"What to expect from a copy of  world-famous tourist trap. Being from Bavaria myself and loving Bavarian food  this is one of the few places in Hamburg to get some. We went to get ""schweinshaxe"", a classic. (Grilled pork shank). First, instead of the typical bread dumplings, it comes with potato dumplings, ok, small issue. But the true dissappointment was the Haxe itself. It was dry and the crust (the best part) was hard as a stone. My feeling is they had put too many on the grill and just warmed up the leftover ones from yesterday, poured the fat over it and sold it as fresh. My mother in law had the pork roast, which had no crust whatsoever and was dry as well. These people are ruining the reputation of Bavarian food! its a Tourist trap. You want the real deal? Go to Munich, at least its the original trap. To be fair, I had a decent Haxe before, at the Speersort -branch of the Hofbräuhaus. But there the waitress was so unfriendly that I did not want to go again. Bad choice, obviously. I'd rather handle grumpy waitresses than bad food. I really hope for them it was just a bad day."
1,the lunch pasta here has large portion.
4,"A really nice little restaurant with high end cuisine. Friendly and relaxed with superb food. I chose the surprise menu, since i couldnt decide which of the delicies to pick. Super friendly waitress, and a dedicated chef who several times came to the table himself. Not overprised at all, and well worth the visit."
1,"The food is very disappointing but the service is great!! This place is decorated really well and as soon as you walk in you feel like you're over at someone's home. They have cute couches, coffee tables and dining room tables everywhere. There even is a cabinet with children's books. So overall it looks perfect! The staff was really friendly but where it all went wrong was the food. I ordered the couscous salad and what I got is a massive plate with one small scoop of couscous which was in ball shape and two leaves on top of the couscous. I was expecting a salad, since they advertised it and two leaves of lettuce do not make a salad. The couscous was SO small it was barely enough to feed a small child. The couscous tasted a little bit crunchy and they definitely overdid it with the oil, it was leaking in oil. Food deserves one star but the fact the restaurant looked cute I bumped it up to two stars."
4,"Best. Schnitzel. Ever. This was my birthday dinner, and it was perfect. The restaurant is a bar and a room for roughly 24 people. No reservations. Waiting is standing room only. But it was worth it. Very much worth it. We both ordered the Schnitzel - since we did not want to share. Their wine selection is small but very good as well. I tried a few of their whites by the glass. Portions were perfect and the room was cheery and warm.Next time I will save room for dessert."
4,"Dig polish food? And vodka? Look no further - the place is not huge, but the food is! To make sure you enjoy a meal there, make a reservation - this place is always packed and for a reason.Friendly and focused staff and you can see the chef in the tiny kitchen.When in Hamburg, make sure to have dinner here."
4,My first time back in Germany in over 20 years and my first meal didn't disappoint! Great portions and great quality. The dining room had a very fun and laid back atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it here!
2,We went there as a small group. The place has a nice decor. They serve typical German food. The food is good but I didn't find it great. May be it was not their night. I need to be back there once more.
4,"The best Mongolian barbeque I've been to. Lots of choice of oriental starters, buffet main courses and the grill too. Also a great selection of desert dishes and ice cream. Very reasonably priced too.Friendly staff and a nice modern interior."
4,"Almost got a point off for the rather long wait for a table, but otherwise a delectable start to the day. Three eggs benedict with a side of Hash Brown each, (looked and tasted a whole lot like country style potatoes to me but hey, maybe thats how they do it in Canada), and three pancakes with maple syrup were as good as inhaled by myself and two starving Bavarian brothers. Top it all off as I did with a hibiscus tea and a coffee and you'll need to be rolled out of the restaurant, like I was. (Almost.) Worth the weight."
4,"Bleeuggh. I was clearly here, since my phone checked me in and I have photos to prove it. However having followed the crowds down at 5.30 am following all night Chelsea-beating-Bayern revelry I don't remember much about it!What I DO remember though was Queen Mary 2 gliding by at 6am plus being saved by about a pint of hot cappuccino poured into me an hour later. So many people there for the Fischmarket  thousands were there even at sunrise on Sunday!"
3,"A pretty cool place near the Schanze. Your typical bar/lounge concept with some interesting design concepts. Without going into details others have already written about, notable is that the crowd tends to be in their twenties (college kids), half the people stand out front so they can smoke and the bartenders tend to be quite nice (rare in Hamburg bars). The chick with half her breasts tattooed is totally cool and the Asian guy is always helpful. There's also a small room downstairs which I found a bit claustrophobic.this is totally skip-able. Definitely worth checking out though as it's one of the morein places when it comes to the Schanze."
3,"I was coming here quite regularly 3-4 years ago but gave up because only one big problem and that is the glutomat chemical which they put in almost everything to improve the taste. I came again to see whether something changed but I'm afraid not much. It's really pity because the place is really good, and most of food and specially dim sums are delicious. Staff should be more polite but this is usual problem when place is very busy, they dont have time for nicer approach. I wasn't sure wether to give 3 or 4 stars because glutomat is serious problem but in the end I gave the streched 4 star because delicious stem breads just landed on my table :-)"
4,"Great food (especially fish and seafood), great service, great location, great atmosphere  THE place for perfect dinner, be it romantic for two or family or dinner with your visitors in Hamburg. It is not cheap and little bit of touristy, but every bite is worth it."
4,"Finaly we decided to drop by this tiny restaurant which we are passing almost every day while we cycle to our work. I must say all the time I had bad opinion about this restaurant, judging by outside look, but once we entered in I immediately recognized that I was wrong. It had pleasant atmosphere with nice smells and welcoming staff (I guess owners). From first view on menu I could feel that here they have good food. I ordered pasta pesto while my wife had some type of fruit soup. It was really delicious and my pasta was even better than in Vapiano, for which I was thinking is far Nr. 1 in Hamburg. I can only say that Sagners is coming on our short list of local restaurant where we are going for lunch breaks."
4,Absolutely awesome!  We'll worth a reason to visit Hamburg alone!  We took backstage tour offered for some extra euros. We were lucky to have taken the tour since we were only two. Great insight of the technology used.
3,Great burgers - best I've had in years - I had the Crack Burger and it was kind of addictive but I wouldn't have sold my body for it. Service is slow though. I down rated one star because of this. I would have down rated two stars - but they acknowledged the poor service in the menu.
4,"The best coffee we had in Hamburg. Espresso as good as i Italy. Lots of people to look at, and excellent place to blend in and watch sct. Pauli meet schanzen..."
4,"Oh my good - Jenfeld. This Part of Hamburg is not really known as a top place to go. But ""top"" often means a typical place for hipsters and or tourists. So - follow the stars of yelp and get surprised.To me Hoang Mai is one the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. Uuuugh, its ugly here. First problem - the door is closed. In general you enter the restaurant via the shop beside. Hey if you solved this problem, the spartan interior and green walls may make you think ""am I right here"". YES YOU ARE!!!The waitress suddenly turned up, presented the menu. Asked If we are in first time. Explained all options of the menu (in really perfect German). Some of the food is vegetarian, but can be ordered with broth. In this case, broth is made of bones - no longer vegetarian at all. Good to now but anyway - bone broth, sounds really good!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because most of the people here are Asians. One more point to assume the food is authentic!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because the taste is mmmmmmmm really incredible. Portions are OK. Referring to the amount and quality, the price is ok, not cheap but neither expensive. So follow the stars - 'cause Yelp will help you to find the hidden stars!"
1,"Maybe I came to this place with really high hopes because I was really let down with the food. I ordered a burrito with guacamole and asked for it to be inside the burrito and instead I got it on the side which is fine (maybe slight language barrier). When I got my food I was excited to see how massive the burrito was! One thing I notices is that they seem to toast them so it looked more like a Panini than a burrito. Then came the other big mistake, the burrito was extremely soggy! You couldn't pick it up and had to use a knife and a fork. Never have I been served a burrito that needs to be eaten that way. Anyway, it tasted pretty ok but the watery part in the middle kind of ruined the flavors. The guacamole was ok!"
4,Definately one of the best chinese restaurants in Hamburg. When the boss is there he enjoys to advise and explain the traditional chinese dishes at the back of the menu. Lots of chinese customers here as well.To access the restaurant you need to go up some stairs.
1,"Just had the lunch buffett.  Not good.  All of the hot food in sauces have thick gelatinous skins, the tempura is soggy, the sushi stale.  Avoid this place, even the beer is bad.  How do you screw up beer in Germany?  We were the only two people in the place for an hour in the middle of lunchtime on a Saturday."
3,"This was a very good eating experience at a very reasonable price for a competitive high end menu in a friendly ambience. We sampled all the appetizers, I was especially taken by the grilled calamari and the ceviche, not too crazy about the tatar. Fellows at my table had the dorade and the risotto with prawns and I heard good things about those as well. I went for the raised ochsenbacke which are the butt cheeks of the ox. That was a delightful piece of meat, extremely tender and flavorful, with a green mash potato better than any mash potato i have had. Their creme brulee is worth a try. Service was a bit slow."
4,"An amazingly beautiful building from inside and out. Make sure to do the tour of the inside, it is well worth it and only cost 4 Euros! You get a bit of history and get to see the amazing rooms. Everything is original which makes the building special in Hamburg. It survived both world wars almost completely (besides for the windows) intact."
3,I feel like the Warehouse district (Speicherstadt) is a time capsule.  There are a lot of old warehouse buildings in this area.  Each warehouse tells a rich story that played a major role in Hamburg's history.  This area is a great place for a stroll and will be more fulfilled if you have a guided tour or read up on it first in a tour book.
4,It's a little hidden place where you will find great and affordable meals. Even in the middle of the night you'll receive lovingly crafted vegetarian food. You can also rent the place for your personal events.
3,Came here with friends from Malaysia/Singapore who live in Hamburg. This restaurant is in the top of their list when it comes to Chinese food. I enjoyed the dinner.
0,"I would not suggest this restaurant and will never ever go there again. The foods are not fresh at all and the waiters are very unfriendly. AND i, and my mother got a stomachache right after!! It might be the worst restaurant i have ever been in this world!"
0,"Stopped in late for a beer and a burger.  Sat at the bar.  Placed our order with hip punk-rock waiter guy and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.  Enjoyed watching the staff eat their food further down the bar while we waited... and waited... and waited.  Finally, after a while we told our waiter that we couldn't wait any longer.  He told us to hold on and that he'd check our food's status in the kitchen.  He came back out and wouldn't make eye contact with  us. Douche.So, the food could have been good, but we never found out.  The service was ass."
4,"This café exceeded my expectations! The café was great, comfy, loud and people were enjoying the vibe and atmosphere the café gives.I went there with my friends and drank something after a long day at work while the other one is busy with studies and needs a breather.I recommend it highly. Please, make a reservation to go there, because we needed to wait for quite some time, but then we asked if we could sit at the bar. We wanted to drink and not to eat, so we couldn't care less if we sit at the table or the bar next to the barkeepers.Best decision ever! We felt the rock-vibe much more than we once felt at a normal table.I don't understand why people are complaining, but that may be because we went there in the late evening (around 21 o'clock) and got the full blast of hard rock or just plain rock. I don't see why people are offended by the music.And the people at the tables should be more realistic ... they do have two floors and only have a limited amount of staff. Naturally, people won't get beer as fast as the speed of light. I had no problems when I went there once when they just opened or just sit at the bar. I've got great service back then and even last week.I'd say that people are at fault for coming in busy times or days. Especially on the weekend, people tend to go there, because the Kiez isn't far from there. So, head up! It's worth it.And I do think the prices are reasonable ..."
2,"I went there last week and i had the filet. To be totally honest its good but its not GOOD.It's average, unlike other comments i cant say its the best steak I've had nor that's it the best steak in hamburg And maybe they changed the cook since aLii's comment but my medium rare was not rare at all, it was actually almost well done. It was a hard piece of steak.But it's averagely priced, for 18EUR you get a salad and fries or baked potato which is ok! I also had their Bocktail vodka with russian berry! That was absolutely berry delicious :)"
1,"Food was good but not worth the money. Service was relatively average and although the location of the restaurant is great, the place is rather dead.FOOD:Great menu! A lot of interesting options gives a very nice first impression. The food is good but completely overpriced. It lacks the nice spicy taste of asian cuisine and it is not very traditional. Also I've noticed some Vietnamese restaurants have started adding onion crumbs into their buns (yeah those you add to hot dogs and other junk food). Unfortunately my dish had that unwanted ingredient. Until this point I had already thought of giving the place a solid three stars; however, the dish was full of hairs and eye lashes which cost them a good rating.SERVICE:Slow, careless and unfriendly. Unfortunately these are the first words that come to mind after eating here. The waiter was way too serious and rather unhelpful. Showed no patience and just wanted to get the job done. Also although we were initially alone in the restaurant it took forever for them to take our order, bring our food and later to take our card. A change in attitude (or staff) might help this restaurant improve its service. LOCATION: Hoheluftchaussee is one of Hamburg's nicest places to go out for dinner. It is very lively and there is a lot to choose from. However this restaurant is rather spiritless. On a positive note the place is big making it perfect for big groups and spontaneous visits without a reservation."
4,"A great value Syrian (I think!) lunch venue in Aldstadt. Don't expect to get served within 20 minutes and get back to work, but if you want a decent sit down session come Friday, you can't go far wrong."
4,"There is no other option than rating this spot with five starts due to it's perfect location. There is obviously no parking and it's best to come by public urban transport and walk the balance. There are some simple food offerings, but they have a good selection of beverages. I also like the approach that they serve a lot of local brands besides the big brands of the large conglomerates. This is a mandatory spot to visit for every Hamburg trip."
4,"The price is a little high and the place a little ""cold"" fancy. but the meat is fantastic."
3,"The food here is great. It's tasty (strong flavors), varied (so many options), fast, and inexpensive. I love coming here for a quick and casual lunch.It's worth explaining the system at Vin O Vin if you've never been, because it's a little complicated, but definitely worthwhile:1. Walk inside, and tell the nice lady behind the counter what you'd like to eat. If you're new, try the small pasta plate (which is quite big), and you can basically choose from 3-5 pasta options and about a dozen vegetable and side dish options in any combination. You can also order meat options (costs extra) like a piece of chicken or some meatballs. 2. The server will make up your plate as you choose things, and when you're done, she'll hand it to someone to be heated up. (This is the part that's a little awkward, because you might expect to just take the plate and start eating. But it's worth the wait.)3. Find a table to have a seat, or if it's crowded, one of the waiters will help you. There's some nice outdoor seating in the summer. One of the waiters will take your drink order once you've sat down, and will bring some bread for the table.4. A few minutes later, a waiter will deliver your food nice and hot for the eating. 5. Return to the far side of the counter to pay for your meal. Just tell them what you ate/drank, and they'll ring you up.Guten Apetit!"
4,"These cupcakes are absolutely fantastic. Even though I had them growing up as a child, they never tasted like these. The cake itself is very moist and the topping (icing/frosting) extremely smooth and creamy. I can really recommend them. EUR2,50 each is a bit much, but seeing that they're hand made and absolutely delicious - well, life is short and as they say, we're not here for a long time, but for a good time.Thanks for making my day, Happy Kappy. I'll be back..!"
3,A very nice place in Hamburg to go for a walk. One round takes about 45 minutes. The park around the see is very calm and most people use it for running or biking. I have reduced my rating by one star because the places for a potential barbeque are very small and possibilities to clean up the charcoal are very rare in comparision to the Stadtpark.
4,"We accidentally landed here during peak lunchtime hour, and you could tell from quite a distance that this place is a fav among the locals. Despite a lengthy queue, we got our Döner Dürüm in less than 15 minutes. In short, if you love kebab, this is the place for you!"
1,"I was there last night with a couple of friends who raved about La sepia, saying - and i quote - the best fish they have had. I am not a fish fan, but i do love seafood. I got the seafood salad and we shared a plate of octopus. Well my salad was... dull.no sauce.fortunately it had a lot of seafood to make up for the unsaucy greens. the octopus were ok, i've had better. otherwise it was a busy night hence it was really slow. we didnt get served at the same time. drinks took around 15 minutes to get to our table. i wouldn't be back soon"
3,"Being relatively new in Hamburg (living here since about eight months), my girldfriend and me went there last Sunday for the first time. At the door my girlfriend had to show the contents of her bag because they wanted to make sure we don't bring any bottles with us. I don't think this is necessary, but hey, it's their club and we had to play by their rules.We were quite lucky finding two seats on a Sunday afternoon and had a fantastic look on the river. I ordered two Astra Alsterwasser at the bar (self-service only) and paid 2,70 EUR each. This definitively is too expensive for this local drink and was the reason we didn't stay for another drink.However, the decoration at this beach club is indeed very stylish (the car grill as a bbq grill is awesome! :) ) and I would suggest to go there at least once to see it."
3,"Great panino and pasta, friendly staff, coffee not the best"
2,"This basic place across the street from Central Station is frequented by many Asians, which I would assume speaks for some authenticity.I was here for a late lunch - a roughly 10-11€ affair when you include a small drink. The spring roll I got was burnt and tasteless. The main dish was a little better, still unremarkable.At the lunch rate it beats all options at the station itself, but I would not have liked to pay dinner prices for this quality. If you like Indian food too, you'll probably have a better time at Badshah just a few houses up the street."
4,"In the immortal words of superhans: ""What the f*'s a washing machine doing in a pub?! Jesus, I need a drink!"". Not only a washing machine either - a bed, table football, and a real hi-fi system. This place is kinda like hanging around in your own house, only you don't have to clean it when all your friends spill drinks everywhere. What a concept! I'm gonna take it to the UK..."
3,"I went to Marseille several months ago as part of a work dinner with some colleagues. Since being diagnosed with celiac, it is always up to me to pick a restaurant, and I chose Marseille because there seemed to be relatively little with wheat in most of the dishes (focusing more on meat, fish, and vegetables). I asked when making the reservation if it might be possible to make something gluten free for someone with celiac, and they said that would be okay. However, I was surprised and impressed that when I arrived, they even had gluten free bread for me! The waitress was also very well-informed about the menu, even knowing that certain things like their polenta had been cross contaminated with wheat. Overall, I was very impressed by their care taken for a celiac diner, even though they do not advertise as being gluten free friendly specifically. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed in the taste of the Bouillabaisse I ordered. However, the service was so good that I would be happy to come back and try a different dish sometime."
1,"Fast in, fast out: this place will quell all your primary late-night urges after all those beers:* fat* carbs* saltIt will indeed do this as competently as any cheap hot-dog place in Denmark .... and that's about it.Taste-wise, nothing to write home about, particularly the flavorless mayonnaise was a turn-off for me."
3,"Great park! Beautiful! A private public space. Lots of green, garden, and water! Mini golf. Ping pong too! Wonderful for a stroll or a picnic! Makes you realize what we lose when we privatize parks in the US..."
3,"They sell Augustiner and good, cheap (before 10pm) cocktails. One problem seems to be that it gets a little too packed. We got there as early as 8pm (very early for a Friday night out in Hamburg) and even then we only managed to get half of the last table in the place. By the time we left, two hours later, it was so packed that you literally had to push people out of the way to get anywhere. Like a mosh-pit."
4,"I shared the massive meat platter and salad. Delicious food, nice beer, good price, and great atmosphere. It DOES manage to do the whole semi-bar, semi-kebab shop really well, and is a great way to start off the night. A niche but very important role. The staff were really friendly too and the food and beers arrived quick. For the quality of quantity of food you get, the price is great."
4,"Don't skip this. Bigger than you think, with lots of attention to detail.  Easy access. Not suitable for wheelchairs (in my opinion) and the scenery switches from day to night very regularly. You can also have a view behind the scenes."
2,"We ate at Kartoffelkeller on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The restaurant is on a very picturesque street in Hamburg, right on the water. The concept of a potato themed restaurant intrigued us so we decided to give it a shot. There weren't many other patrons in the restaurant since we were late for lunch so we were seated right away.  The decor seemed a bit dated and it seems like a place that gets a lot of business from tourists--which isn't a bad thing but you could tell the place needed a little ""freshening-up.""I had the Hamburger Pannfisch and the husband had potato pancakes and the potato soup with sausage. Both of our meals weren't particularly spectacular but they weren't horrible either. We came away satisfied so we consider that a win. Portions were large but we didn't think that the food quality justified the price."
4,"Everytime i walk through the weidenallee i see L'incontro and say to myself, i should try that place out.and i finally have!when i got there around 7 pm, the place was already full, and we got one of the last 2 available tables. the place was full all through out the evening, with more than half of the tables 'reserved'. the food is really good.I highly advise you to try the gnocchi with 'maronen' ... its a delight. L'incontro is a cute little italian restaurant, its cozy, could be romantic if you are in the mood.I think reservation would be preferable although not required. All in all, the weidenallee is a nice change from schanze (and not too far away), if you are looking for something for the older crowd"
4,"Yum!One of the better values since I've been in Hamburg. I got the Schweinebraten (roast pork. DAT SKIN DOE.), mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut. You can either get a small or large portion, though there wasn't too big of a difference between the two. The small seems to be good enough. They spoke English here. :)DAS GOOT."
4,"Alright... we knew this was the best always !!!Superb hospitality. Huge ballrooms and excellent catering. We had a fine experience visiting the interiors, not to forget the Phantom Room- where all the history of this hotel lies.. its my favorite...all time !!!"
2,I thought this place was fine.  the view is certainly great.  The Pannfisch hamburger style was very nicely done.  but the sous vide salmon was not as successful - seemed odd in texture.  Overall the prices were pretty high so the 'value for money' didn't work for me.
3,"Nice bar for an early evening's night out. It gets pretty packed quickly, so arriving early guarantees you a place to sit and cheaper drinks during Happy Hour (until 22:00). I had a Caipirinha, which was large and delicious, for 4.50 euros. I like this bar because of the unique ""fish"" tank in the center of the bar. Digital fish swim around the tank and digital leaves float on top of it. It's touch sensitive, so the fish and the leaves react to your fingers. This is really my favorite bit about this place, which has everything to do with the fact that a large chunk of my brain never grew up with the rest of it and I still have immense child-like fascination with these type of things. Recommended for an early evening, but try to get out early, as well, or you're going to have to arrange for a battering ram to force your way outside."
3,"Tours cost around €15 per person, which seemed a bit much at first.  The tour lasted around 90 minutes, and we took the English one (there is one English tour M-F per day and two on the weekend days).  It walked us through the process to make chocolate and offered 7 samples throughout the process from bean to wrapped chocolate which they made throughout the tour.  Our guide was awesome, and made the whole thing well worth it.  Also, we got to decorate our own bar of chocolate to take home as a souvenir."
4,"Great pub and delicious food. Had grilled brandy chicken with yummy creamy mushroom sauce. My husband had the traditional fish and chips but without the chips and more salad. Got ourselves beer and shandy to finish our dinner. The food was just awesome, having to eat in a classic pub ambience."
4,"This is the COOLEST museum/exhibit that I have EVER SEEN!  When you think you are going to visit a tiny recreation of the world via trains...it is even better and bigger than that.  I mean, this guy and his team have thought of everything!!!  The lights go down for nighttime and the sceneries interact with you/change depending on the time of day, etc.  It is so hard to explain the magic of this place.  There are generally lines but so worth the wait.  Block off some time for this one.  This is not a place you want to pop in a run through.  The details are crazy cool and necessitate a lengthier visit.  I wish I could go back and share this with so many of my friends and family members but it is sooo far away for me.  If you are reading this and considering a visit, do it!  You will not be disappointed, but rather left in awe by the creativeness of it all."
4,"The ""transparent bakery"" (Gläserne Bäckerei) is a bakery located conveniently next to ""Planten und Blomen"" (plantenunblomen.hamburg.… ) and the Dammtor train station. It is run by Effenberger (effenberger-vollkornbaec… ) and offers a selection of freshly baked and often still warm delicious organic whole-grain bread. You can observe the whole process and have a chat with the baker in charge. A fun place, also for children."
4,"A great Turkish lunch spot, with tasty food and incredibly fast service! I'm usually here atleast once a week for lunch. I really like the chicken with rice plate, and mixed sharp/yogurt sauce. The staff is really friendly; you can get by with English if necessary. Seating is kind of hard to come by around lunch, but they have mixed standing/seating areas. Even if you don't stay, there is someone always offering tea, which is such a nice treat."
3,"Very fun to visit and a cool art experience, but very tiring! I love art, but without a guide or audio guide I had no natural path to follow. I ended up viewing only a portion of the art works before we all grew tired. The cafe was inexpensive and served delicious cake For future visitors who also prefer not having a guide, I recommend using a map or consulting with the staff before you embargo on the journey. Altogether the museum is breathtaking, and worth the visit."
4,"Great food, great place, near the city centre and with a subway station right under it. The room it's huge, with high ceilings and full of chandeliers with low light, creating an intimate (but not boringly romantic) and cool environment. Really friendly staff, and surprisingly relaxed environment. One of the best Italian restaurants I've ever went to! I started with a duck carpaccio (It wasn't raw, so It was tasty!) Tried a spicy Sicilian sausage pasta (I want more!). Finished with a huge Tiramisu (but it was average, although my eyes - and everybody's eyes in the room - were really happy with it's size). There was some kind of wave when they saw my Tiramisu coming. Or maybe it was just the great Sicilian (30EUR/bottle) wine. :)I totally recommend it! High price (45EUR/person with wine), but its worth the effort!"
4,"superb food, superb choice, reasonable prices. nice that they serve with tea and chips while you wait to pick up a take away order."
2,"pretty good food, decent service.we had a pizza - good, lasagna - not good, a few salads - good, and a pasta special of the day with chanterelle mushrooms - amazing.we were greeted warmly at the door by, seemingly, the owner.we did experience long wait times after that though, but maybe that's just the culture ?"
4,it was GREAT! There is no Menü. You get a three course meal of Fish and Shrimps. what ever the boss bought on the Fish market fir the Day. The Boss cooks himself. If you like Fish you have to visit this Place.
3,"Great food with fantastic seating inside! Very crowded on the weekends so expect a wait. The food is served in trays and very affordable. About 6 euros per dish served with bread, rice, yogurt, Dahl, small salad, rice and the main dish. Lacks true authentic spice but very good still. Recommend tikka and the saag, and if you're a fan of spicy just ask!"
2,"This is a traditional place in Hamburg which has been around forever. I've been here multiple times over the years but having just watched the EM final there last night, it was time to write something. It's basically a kiosk turned into a restaurant. It's still has the shabby flair but they've gone upmarket a bit adding things like wine, shrimp, salads to the menu. I don't know how little they used to serve way back when but it's no longer just beer and fries. Surprisingly enough, I had the beer and fried and they were really good. I haven't ever eaten anything else here and it's not gourmet or anywhere near it. If you are up for a classic beach club in Hamburg, live nearby and can get here easily (which is not the case when coming from the other side of town) and the sun is out or it's a warm evening, definitely stop in. Plus, as someone already wrote in the German section the crowd is also becoming a bit more upscale again. This place went a bit down-scale over the years but I believe management is doing it's best to get out of that hole and attract hipper people. If that's a good thing, I don't know!"
3,"Cool bar in between St. Pauli and the Schanze. They sell Pilsner Urquell pretty cheap and have a cool open mic night, which is what I was there for. The only drawback with this place is that it's a little bit isolated."
3,"I enjoyed this place immensely. In my walk back to my hotel, I needed to grab a bite for dinner. Found a fun outside table and ordered a glass of wine. Based on previous yelp reviews, I knew better than to order the nachos, but I didn't want to order a full dinner. I opted for the fried Camembert app, which arrived with a nice crisp basic salad. The plate had two discs of Camembert, which I found very generous. It was hot, crunchy and crisp and the berry sauce they came with went perfectly with them.The waitstaff was very friendly: disclaimer, I do speak fluent, native German so that may help a bit. But they were very easy going when I asked to move to get out of the plume of cigarette smokers. Price was reasonable and I left full and happy!!"
3,"Riad's is a nice little restaurant. It's a little bit dark in here if you don't get a seat in the front room, but pretty comfortable nevertheless. I had a delicious Falafel plate for 5,50EUR from the lunch menu card. For 7,50EUR you can also get a lunch menu consisting of any main course, three starters and a desert. This is what I'm going to try next time, since I still was a little hungry after having had my Falafel plate."
4,"After spotting in the newspaper last year that they were going to build Prototyp I was very happy to see it finally open.If your using public transport then Meßberg is your station. It's only a short 5 minute walk which is pretty good considering the HafenCity is a bit of a pain when it comes to public transport. The building is nicely set in a Speicherstadt style house. Just walking into the building is impressive. Suddenly switching from old to ultra modern! I must admit I felt like I just walked into an ultra stylish restaurant or clothes shop. Fantastic effect!!After paying the 7.50 Euro for the ticket (it's worth even if you only 'like' the look of cars). The staff were incredibly attentive I must admit. From being generally cheerful to giving helpful advice. Not sure if that's just a case of them still being in the opening phase or something.To the cars..A fantastic collection of various unique cars. Every car has in front of it a info box embedded in the floor. And what impressed me more than anything was a ~7 inch TFT display with a info video on loop (nice touch!).The first segment has a varied collection. But when you move deeper in then you get a lot of Porsche's. Not that I am complaining!Right at the back of the first floor is the simulator, a converted Porche 356 with a nicely sized flatscreen (tasteful enough sized). So you can drive a simulated track using the real steering wheel and gear shift. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to get on it as there were a lot of kids hogging (next time I will give it a go!).So after going round the first floor I finally find a Audio Room. Basically a 2m x 1m room with a touch screen display. Guessed what you can do in this room? Listen to the different sounds of different cars racing off. Fantastic I had a wonderful 10+ minutes of eardrum damaging fun!What else was on the first floor. The typical movie theatre affair with a HUGE screen. Although the video quality was not all that fantastic (they must have upscaled it).Downstairs is a temporary exhibition which was relatively basic but still fantastic. Some Formula 1 racing cars and very impressive Audi's.The one bit I totally missed out on was the art gallery. Next time I will have to take a look.So all in all Prototyp Hamburg is WELL worth a visit.So now done with the positive stuff. There were a few nigels I had with the place. The first being the touch screen computers. They were often very fiddly to use. For example in the Audio Room you had to double click on the volume control and make sure you helld your finger down to adjust the volume. Me being a techy it's no surprise right? :)The only other nigel is that the transition being floors is a little unclear. When you leave the first floor you feel like you have just left the exhibition. Then you walk downstairs and get surprised as there is another floor of cars.Conclusion  go visit it, as it's really worth it!"
1,Very boring food - tasteless pasta and salat that did not seem fresh. But the staff was very energetic and the location on a side street was very nice.
4,This was probably the best meal I ate during my two weeks in Germany! Everything was home made and there was so much attention to detail! I had spätzle with sauce and cheese and tried a dumpling with minced meat- both were outstanding! The staff were so kind and the English translated menu was perfect! I would absolutely recommend this place for an authentic German food experience!
3,"Was very pleasantly surprised by this place. A friend invited me here for lunch having eaten here before. I was expecting bland kiosk style food. It turned out to be really good and the portions are solid. They have a ""Mittagskarte"" which makes everything affordable if you come during the day. I've not yet eaten dinner here but I presume it fills up fast. Service is always polite...have now been here a couple times and food tends to come out fairly quickly. It's also nice to sit outside if the weather allows for it but there aren't that many tables...as is the case with most places on the Lange Reihe."
1,"Very disappointed having made this a ""must do"" evert time I'm in town. The service was good. The lobster bisque Ok, and the penne beef pasta boring flat and not worth eating. My colleague ordered a gin and tonic and couldn't finish it. We ordered the tiramisu and there wasn't the hint of liquor in it - ""safe for all ages"". Not what I want from one of my favorite desserts."
1,"Unfortunately it's only in German. It feels a little uncoordinated when walking through the museum. There's just a lot of text/information everywhere. It was cool to see and I got a little information brochure in English, still I think such a museum, especially in such an international city like Hamburg, should offer it in both languages, German and English."
4,"This is the new branch of the well known Hamburg based burger chain, featuring the famous Blockhouse Burger.The place I often have been to on Jungfernstieg is just too hammered and busy to be fun anymore, so coming here was a real treat. So it's the usual Jim Block quality and service, but with added comfort, plus free gifts for the kids.Very nice."
4,"I LOVED this place. But go early, because it gets packed and can be pretty hot and uncomfortable to get around in the tight spaces with all the things to see. Love how magical it is when the lights change from Day to Night and you can see the towns/ cities light up. You can spend quite a few hours here taking everything in, so plan accordingly. Wear comfy shoes and again, go early!!"
2,"First to make things clear, I am not a student nor on a budget. I've also had the benefit of eating steak in some of the best places in and outside of Germany hence my hurdle for quality meat is quite high. Hopi, located so close to my home, is unfortunately a disappointment. Having moved here recently I was looking for the occasion to try this place out. From the reviews here I was expecting to be wow'ed. Well, didn't quite happen. This is an older place and the interior is going downhill. Nicely maintained yet aging in terms of design. Even Block House with it's old school flair seems a bit more modern. Not a big deal though. This is a very subjective issue. Unfortunately where things went wrong for me was with the food. I had the ribeye steak. Prepared and served just like at Block House with the salad and garlic bread. The meat was horrible. I ordered it medium rare and it was gummy and bland. This was not good meat and if it were prepared by a gourmet chef would probably still not taste well. The garlic bread was ok but on the dry side. The salad very simple and the dressing forgettable. Don't get me wrong. For the cheap prices here, it's a good way to get your steak on. Once you've finished studying or received your first paycheck, it's time to move on. Yes, Block House is more expensive but the meat is consistent. Butchers, Meatery or the place in Afrikahaus are all better.On a side note, our waitress was super nice. We had the lady with the short, blonde hair and she really was a sweetheart. Unfortunately, the old guy (who I presume was the owner) was in the middle of a heated fight with the Asian lady at the end of the night. We were the last guests and these two really went at, insulting each other loud enough that we had ringside seats. We were amused but it didn't do much to lure us back in the future. ""Professional"" is defined otherwise."
3,"It's cheap, but not like the bird.  What can i say except, i don't know what to say. Have you ever noticed that the English language reviews in Hamburg don't give you any useful information?"
4,Great lil Surprise to find this Vegan Optional Middle Eastern Food. Farina at the counter was kind enough to explain everything to us in English & monitor our spending cz we only had 20 Euros in cash until I could find an ATM In Hamburg that would take my card. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this sweet lil Palestinian Cafe run by Farina & the Palestinian Family. ENJOY
3,"What a delightful surprise!In a city centre populated by fast food joints, lousy service and that unmissable local ""attitude"" where it seems the customer is there to compliment the establishment and not the other way around, O-ren stands out.The food we ordered did take a long period to prepare, which is usually a good sign and one not to be taken for granted in this town. Finally there, we were all delightfully surprised how crunchy the vegetables were, delectable the meats and fresh the herbs tasted. Only slight drawback is the hectic service which is understandable since we were there during the lunch break. I think it might do the restaurant a world of good if they had more people manning the counters and tables during the prime time hours. Still they were friendly considering the influx of customers and long waiting line at the door. Still, we will definitely be regulars. Thanks for a good time."
4,"Absolutely amazing ""all you can enjoy"". Don't worry about the limit, you will very unlikely get there. And it's so convenient to order your food by iPad."
0,"OrderedAManhattan-Saturday night, trendy spot, was not very full. Service was quick and nice, but the Manhattan didn't taste like a Manhattan. Tasted more like cough syrup. My boyfriend a Cuba Libre. Also didn't taste like a Cuba Libre. We finished the drinks and quickly set off to find a better bar."
4,"We were here with my Chinese in-laws, to give them a first impression of German food. so it was not the easiest for any restaurant to please us. However ""Goldene Gans"" managed to make us happy. It was crowded, but luckily they have a very nice back section, which I did not know about. So the restaurant is a good deal larger than it appears at first sight. The service was perfect and was not uncomfortable by a mixed language group (In-laws speak neither English nor German). The waiter handled everything graciously, brought the baby-chair for our little one (as soon as it was free) without the need for a reminder. Sharing dishes so everybody gets to try everything was no problem either an de got extra knifes and forks. We had deer, pork, Zander and trout. All tasted very good."
3,'raw like sushi' offers a great choice of sushi and bentos besides having lovely deserts. Important: the sushi not just standard maki & co but somewhat creative! These facts and the good atmosphere make this place a good alternative to the growing number of sushi place in Hamburg and is definitely worth a try.
3,"If you are in Hamburg you absolutely must come to eat here, since the food here is the best!The food is so freaking amazing, the prices are great, service awesome and the ambience was perfect.I wish they could deliver to Berlin haha! I crave their bowl of pho all the time."
3,This is a very nice family owned Italian restaurant. I came here for dinner and enjoyed the cosy atmosphere. Better yet it was neither too pack nor was it too loud. The food was alright. Not the best Italian I have had in Hamburg but definitely fair in regards to value for money. The mains are ~8 euros. What I can vouch very much for though is their tiramisu. That was very good and very large! Order one and split between 2 as I did.The most surprising thing for me was this was the first time in my entire year in Hamburg thus far  that a waiter has asked me if I'd like tap water when i asked for water. This is such a rarity in Germany. Anyone that's moved to Germany will know what i mean. That in itself is deserving of an additional star hence 4
3,"We didn't book a table but they were able to find us a seat instantly in the main room. The resturant has two rooms first as you walk through the door and the section through a corridor with a display showing the special of the day behind a glass display. Both rooms were busy but not over crowded and all staff were very polite and welcoming.The restaurant is very close to a train station and in an alternative arty district.The decor is very urban and industrial but in a very stylish manner. You can tell all the details and artwork was heavily scrutinised and calculated for the right look.After much debate over the menu we ordered two beers and went with the Lamb shoulder for two at 23 Euros each this was one of the cheapest mains on the menu. We ordered two sides Chantellene mushrooms and mashed potatoe with onions.The drinks came quickly followed 20 minutes later with our mains, the lamb was served on a wooden plaque and our dishes were two wooden chopping boards with steak knifes attached by magnet. This was served with mini side salad of which you could choose the dressing and half a corn on the cob. The waitress charved the meat off the bone onto the plaque board then presented this to us on our table.The food was lovely, the meat was very tender and the sides were cooked perfectly and very tasty. We actually didnt need the extra sides as the portion was quite big. The only negative i could give was the price was quite steap however for good quality food, it will never be cheap. The mashed potatoe was fluffy with mini bits of onion and the mushrooms were sauted in butter and herbs. we orded a espresso and jager after the meal and the total was 70 Euro, not cheap but as we were satisfied this was not a problem. I would recommend this resturant but mainly for an occassion to celebrate."
4,"If you go to Hamburg, even without your kids, you must go visit this place. It is fantastic! But go there late in the evening or very early in the morning - else there will be to many tourists.Expect to use minimum 2 hours there, even though you do not think a mini-world is anything for you, this place is a must see."
4,Great place to enjoy a hearty breakfast and a nice cappuccino. The place looks nice and the staff is friendly.
4,"Believe it or not, this is the best place for university students and everyone else alike.  I bring up university because you remember how tough it was back in school to eat healthy, a good size portion, and for a good price, right?!  I rate this levels above Campus Suite for quality, because most people from school do not know about this lunch spot and end up eating at Campus Suite if they go off campus away from the Mensa (cafeteria food at school).Well this place solves all that and does it in good timing to boot! This spot is totally worthy of a five star rating!  Every type of person comes here and enjoys returning because they have a great lunch special.  Usually it is some fish or pasta of the day and it tastes so good and costs 6€ was what I paid for a tagliatelle fresh pasta with creamy tomato sauce, grilled wild salmon with herbs, and freshly grated parmesan cheese with cracked pepper to add the final touches.   If you do not have to be at work or at school within the hour, once can also stop in here and have a glass of wine.  Most of the space is standing limited, but if you can get a window seat at the bar, its nice to watch everyone walk by on the Colonnaden above. since the restaurant is located below ground level. Specialty meals can change depending on what fish or pasta they have on hand during different times, which is a nice reason to return here regularly."
4,"First of all, you probably want to make a reservation. I dropped by for dinner on a weeknight without a reservation, and they basically said ""We're completely booked but you can sit here for an hour."" I guess I should have known based on how full they were that the crepes would be really good.I had the L'Apetit, which is a standard ""ham, egg, and cheese"" galette topped with spinach, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. It tasted far better than standard, however! The galette was perfectly cooked, just a little bit crispy on the outside. The ham, egg, and cheese combination was already really good, but the toppings were all surprisingly tasty as well. Each was flavored a little bit differently and the combination of flavors (plus the crispy galette) worked really, really well.The atmosphere is like sitting in a cafe in France, so you might get a little confused about where you're located in the world! Staff are friendly and fluent in English. There's also an English menu available if you, like me, don't speak German. Prices are pretty decent at around 10 euros for a savory galette.I've had galettes in other parts of the world, including France, and this place is near the top of the list. I was too full to try out a sweet crepe, but I'd like to come back someday!"
4,Loved this place. Was so cute inside and the tapas were awesome! Def coming back again maybe during the happy hour when the food is discounted. Can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommend.
4,"Good food good service good prices. I would definitely come back when in town. Not the best of areas, but if you're close to the station, it's worth a visit."
3,"My wife and I haven't eaten at too many Italian restaurants in Hamburg since we first moved here, but enough to feel like pizza here just isn't very good. It seemed like most restaurants liked to reheat some version of a frozen pizza or just some other variety that just didn't taste authentic, or really very good for that matter.We were beginning to lose hope, thinking that we had to travel to Italy constantly to get good pizza (which obviously isn't a bad thing at all, especially since plane tickets aren't too bad from here). For the times we don't feel like leaving Hamburg but really want pizza, Grazie a Dio for Luigi's! It's the best tasting pizza we've tried, and the most authentic thus far in Hamburg.  All of the pizzas are very good (especially the pizza parma) and cooked in a large indoor wood-fired oven! I love that! Lunch menu portions, which are served around 12pm to 3pm Mon. - Fri. are just the right size per person at an awesome deal of 5€ per person with a small drink. Off-weekday-lunch hours the pizzas are almost double the price, but also probably 1.5 times the size...so there's that. My wife and I actually struggled to finish two pizzas on a lovely summer afternoon in Hamburg and had to box about a half of a pizza to take home. We will continue to try new pizza places throughout our new home, but we're glad to know that we have a really good place to come back to again and again."
3,"Delicious burgers and amazing cheesecake. They weren't really lying when they advertise the cheesecake as being the best in the world. Oh, and some pretty good beer here too.When it's crowded you can expect to wait quite awhile to get your food (like almost an hour...so it's best to be in good company and feel like drinking a couple of beers), but when it's not you'll receive your food in a reasonable amount of time.We've tried a number of burgers here, The Rock (my fav so far), the Filthy Harry, Da Woiks, The Jack (which has blue cheese dressing(?)), and the Dr. Zian. All of the burgers are served on toasted English muffins and the meat patties are juicy, flavorful, and as big as a baseball! The burgers are also served with a generous amount of tasty fries.My rules to adhere to when dining here: if it's too crowded then leave (unless you don't mind waiting a long time to get your food), but if it's not too bad and you can easily find a seat, then you should really dine here."
2,"We thought it was a regular sit-down type of restaurant when we first popped in before we realized it was just a much nicer fast food burger joint than we had back home. The menu isn't super descriptive and I don't speak German, but I was able to make out some of it from the online menu and photos.I got the regular size (one patty) JB Champignon, which came with mushrooms, cheese, and sautéed onions. I decided to make it a combo with their freshly made lemonade and garlic bread instead of fries, because I had never seen it as a side to a burger before (not thinking there would be an excessive amount of bread). I'm a big eater but the burger turned out to be larger and wider than I had expected, so I was glad I only got the one patty instead of two. These are the kind of burgers you might want to eat with a fork and knife! The burger also came with lettuce and, unexpectedly, this creamy, mayo-based type of sauce, which was good but got to be overwhelming and very heavy near the end. I ended up scraping some of the sauce off the bun and then later gave up on the bun to eat most the garlic bread instead.Like some other restaurants in Europe, my husband had to pay extra for ketchup, which was their own chain brand that came in a big packet. I also took a couple sips of his Fritz-kola, which is a soda brand made in Hamburg. My husband was also very stuffed with meal (I think he got a two-patty JB BBQ, but I can't remember).We were both really impressed with some of the people around us who were licking their plates clean. It seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck, though more expensive for us in general with the conversion rates from Canadian into Euros. Clean washrooms, quick and fast service, less waste because of the real cutlery and plates they give you - I can see why this place/chain is so popular!"
4,The best chicken sandwich I've ever had was from here! Super cute little cafe with delicious food. The staff is very friendly and service is great! It was right in the main area of Hamburg so very easy to find. I highly recommend!
4,"If you have ever wondered what it is like to be in India then Jaipur Indian Restaurant is the place to go! Once you walk in you are transported by the smells, the decor and they friendly staff. The carved wood chairs and the music set the mood as you sit down and are presented with a list of mouth watering delicacies. You will want to try them all and you should. I found the best way to experience Jaipur is to come with a group of friends and order a range of different dishes and share it family style. This way you get a little taste of everything so when you decide to come back again you know exactly what you want. The spices, the textures, the flavors, it all combines in your mouth and it leaves you wanting more. Even if your mouth has a 4 alarm fire going on you can wash it down with a cool, creamy, mango lassi! The cold yogurt drink put the fire out while still being able to enjoy the flavors you love. The staff is just the icing on the cake. One of the most friendliest, helpful, and quick staff I have come across in a long time. The prices are average and if you want to make a night of it I would suggest heading over to the English Theatre for a show or walk down the street and party the night away with some cosmic bowling! Jaipur Indian Restaurant is a must! I expect all of you to be lining up at the door the next time I visit."
3,StrandPauli has a great location at the Hamburg harbour. Its a great place to hang out in the beach chairs enjoying the sun. The service was unfortunately a bit slow especially compared to the amount og people. And it would be nice with some heating lamps and blankets for sundown. Prices were reasonable. I'll be back!!
4,Authentic Indian food! Especially the naan! The portion size was also perfect. Only thing that was a bit irritating was the limited sitting space.
4,Fisch & co. serve up tasty fresh fish with multiple choices. You can eat inside or outside. It has a really rustic feel and is on the oldest street in Hamburg. The staff is friendly and prices are good.
3,Recommended for high ambiance and good food.
3,"first time here. Came with a group of people, actually 20 people. Really great for group. Food is great. I order extra no 4, it was pork and lamb skew mix with fries. The meat was nicely grilled. The guy next to me ordered a lamb plate, also looking really good. Probably gonna try it next time. Well, what is funny is I just found out lemonade in Germany is actually sprite. Well maybe I will try beer here next time."
4,"Karls is just awesome! I grew up going loads to ethiopian restaurants and having lots of ethiopian food so when the chance came to go along with a group to have some injera, I was immediately on that train.It is a small family owned and run restaurant that gives you a very cozy and homey feeling. Alex greets you with a smile when you get in and engrosses you with very interesting stories about origins and history of the food all through the meal as he brings dishes. He really cares about where his ingredients come from and its very evident when he speaks about it. On display are lots of spices, coffee, some baskets from Ethiopia and books next to the windows all centering round the theme of Ethiopia. Some of the coffee and teas are even available to buy.  We got a couple of mixed platters which came in the typical style I'm accustomed to. A large circular tray covered with an injera base with meats, vegetables and sauces on top for a couple of people to share together in a communal style of eating. Additional injera was also brought to eat. Everything was absolutely delicious from the bean sauce to the egg, mince etc. We all ate so much that at the end of the meal we had to seat back and relax for a bit before getting up. If that isn't an indicator of a great meal, I don't know what is. As it is both a cafe and ethiopian restaurant, also available are some cakes; the cheese cake looked good but I was just too full to try any and other treats you'd find at a cafe available.As we were in on a Friday night, we also got to experience the coffee making ceremony which they do only on Friday and Saturday nights so I'd recommend making a reservation and coming on those days if you would like to see it. The coffee beans are roasted as per the ceremony and coffee made for you to drink post-meal using the beans."
4,"Had the Homemade dumplings--Maultashen, spatzle soup,caraway bread and a chocolate brownie w vanilla ice cream. High quality outstanding meal in a small unassuming setting. Everything homemade.  An outstanding meal."
4,"delicious ramen! perfect ramen texture, tasty soup with fresh ingredients. fast service and affordable pricing."
4,"I used to go to this place very often when I lived in St. Georg. A little hidden in a sidestreet next to the famous ""Lange Reihe"", this is the coffee shop to go on your walk around the district. It is small, intimate,  friendly and very cozy. The prices are okay. Not very cheap of course, but affordable compared to shops like Starbucks or Balzac (the latter is around the corner and by far the wrong choice). They offer a nice choice of small snacks, candy, soda, pastries and ... of course... coffee which comes in two sizes. Ever since I left Hamburg, I returned every once in a while only to find out that nothing has changed in Peaberries which definately is a good thing here.They have rather restrictive opening hours and only very little place for seating. I suppose it is more of a ""coffee to go"" shop. Many people chose to sit on the benches outside by the Gurlittstr. which happens to be quite a nice promenade near the Alster."
3,"Now, I was a bit apprehensive about how much I would enjoy this and how much time I could actually spend looking at miniature figures but, I surprised myself on how facilitating it all was.  All these tiny figures painted and positioned in such detail.  Every time you looked at something different you were stood for a while taking it all in.  Then you would spot something quirky going on like a naughty couple in the car or a random dinosaur lurking somewhere so then you start a little hide and seek to see what else you can find that no one else may have spotted.It isn't just figures standing around either.  Hit the buttons nearby to activate movement in certain areas.  Again, sometimes this took a while to spot what was actually moving/changing so absorbed more of your attention and time.The time, detail and effort put into everything is truly amazing and I think everyones favourite is the airport where you can want planes landing and taking off (I kid you not!).  There are things there that just make you stop and look and look and somethings which make you laugh.  You will be wandering around in here for some time and, depending on how busy it is, you will be surprised about how much time you actually spend in here.We came a little late in the evening so had to quickly move through the last part however, I know we could have spent another half hour there on just that bit having been there for probably 1 hour before hand.  We were able to move through fairly reasonable pace but if it is busy, I can imagine you would easily double this time.As they are adding countries and places to this all the time, I'd imagine you could come back in a few months to see more and spend equally as much time in here."
2,"This is one of my favorite cafes around the area where I live. Coffee is decent (I generally have the soja cappucino) but their food is the real deal. Great to have a small bite or for brunching during rainy days. I recommend their soups and their vegetarian quiche. Additionally they have free wifi, making it a great alternative to Starbucks if you need a place to read or work. If you are in the area, check it out!Mucho love,D."
4,"I love, love, love Loving Hut! I come here for dinner at least once a month. Although the service can be a bit slow (this place gets packed and it's family run, so sometimes there's only one guy in front), the food can't be beat and it's well worth the wait. I've tried a lot of things on the menu and enjoyed them all, but I always come back to the summer rolls and the pho. Speaking of the soup, never will you have a better meatless pho, and even before I became a vegetarian I would've said this is the best in Hamburg regardless of animals protein content. So, whether you eat meat or not, this place is highly recommended!"
4,"Excellente. Had a superb porcini mushroom (Steinpilz) tortellini in a light cream sauce, washed down with a lovely glass of pinot grigio. I rarely order vegetarian meals but this was excellent and one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The restaurant is modern and stylish. The service is friendly and very professional. I was there midweek and didn't need to book a table but I'm sure weekends are very busy. I'd love to go back when have a bigger appetite and have several courses."
4,"A very cute cafe with delicious drinks and pastries! Came here last week to meet some friends for coffee and I'm so glad they chose this spot! I had their filtered coffee and a piece of one of their in house baked cakes ( almond cake?). Both items were very tasty! The staff was super friendly and was quick to make my coffee! I was told that they make most of their pastries and cakes in house and looks like all their offerings are delicious. They had the cutest cookies and petit fours next to the register and I was tempted to buy them all! Actually later that night I got to try some more of their cakes and pastries! We tried a piece of their blueberry cheesecake which was really tasty. We also had an assortment of chocolate treats which were equally as good! There was one treat that was like a salted caramel chocolate tart...sooo good!Highly recommend this place to catch up with a friend over great coffee and delicious sweet treats. Also, this place takes only cash!"
3,"A very nice place in a fast changing Barmbek, Hamburg.  We had Flammkuchen (German/French pizza without tomato base) and it was very nice.  Nice beer from draft and service very friendly (we were served by Korean-German waitress and she was very helpful).  TRUDE is located near the Osterbekkanal right next to a very interesting museeum (museum of work: where else outside of Germany could you find such a museum ...?). There are other typical German, but also international and vegetarian options on the menu.  At night a nice place to sit outside."
3,"This is a Korean restaurant. Why there also happens to be sushi on the menu too is completely baffling. This is pretty obvious from how much more Korean food is on the menu than sushiI chose to go with a classic. It's hard to ever go wrong with bibimbap. Good food portion, really good sauce and an authentic bibimbap. I was pleased. I shall return to try the rest of the menu, mostly likely their bulgogi"
1,"The sushi and other plates here aren't at all good tasting. There's a 20 euro ""all you can eat"" deal where you sit at a rotating table and grab dishes. It's not a waste of money (since unlimited food), but I couldn't say I thought any of the dishes had much flavor. The fish is low-quality, the rice is okay, and the presentation is kinda sloppy. There's not great sushi in Hamburg, but there's definitely way better sushi than here."
4,"Charming space. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Warm and welcoming. Efficient service. Fantastic seafood. Great drinks. Reasonably priced. Classy, but not at all stuffy. The Labskaus was excellent. It's kind of like a seafood tartare. Lovely. Excellent soups and sauces. Highly recommended. Would definitely return."
4,"Wow, what a delight. We went there for dinner and opted for the full 8 course menu. The whole concept is around using some innovative techniques and bold flavours in delicate dishes. The highlights were some veal with chickpeas and ananas. Amazingly powerful and delicate. Wagyu Beef with topinambur and truffles, this was just wow. The rich and melting meat with the truffles were perfect together. Another great dish was some sorbet served in Champagne. I am not a huge fan of Champagne, but combined with the sorbet it worked perfectly. Combined with some great wines and good service this was a very memorable evening. I can only recommend this place."
4,"I like this place! Friendly people, associates and their coffee is great, salads tasteful and their bagels are 100% OK. Worth a visit and enjoy it!"
4,That was definitely the fastest served burger i've ever had. It was also tasty. Fries could be better though. Still 5 stars because i enjoyed the burger and dont care about fries.
3,"Busy little Mexican bistro but inviting to step inside! Menu options are basic but have all the necessary ingredients to get your Mexican taste buds watering. The only thing missing at a glance was fish tacos or a shrimp option. Otherwise it seemed that the more simple the better!They offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. You can order veggie, vegan, tofu, chicken, steak, beef, or even chorizo fillers/toppings along with a variety of typical sides such as rice, beans, cheeses & several sauces. There is a sign that states: If we do not serve you within 10min, you'll be served in 15-20min, we are doing the BEST we can!!! Fair enough, but even with such a warning, the smells and your hunger wear down your patience as you sit feeling famished and eager to eat! The service is so friendly one does not complain, but when your food finally comes to the table, you dig right in!!! The portions are huge and the burritos are fresh & tasty :-) It reminds me of a German version of the U.S chain, Chipotle but without seeming sooo franchisey (I made up that word just now) Order a side of sour cream & salsa then enjoy!!!"
2,"A nice atmosphere, with running sushi, was kinda full, but still good sushi."
3,"Dubara is apparently ""the best kebab shop in Hamburg"". This is more of a folk-lore thing amongst my friends then an official claim, but of course, I had to test this theory out. OK - I have to be honest here, due to the baffling popularity of doner in continental europe, you're never going to get quite a good a kebab in France/Germany/Holland etc. as you will down the curry mile in Caspian's, Manchester (check out the reviews!!), but this place isn't bad at all. They do a special with coated nan with some sort of pizza sauce, all wrapped cylindrically, so you can eat it length-ways. This is important as any kebab-lover can attest. This monster will set you back EUR 3.70, although there are cheaper options, including a kebab with chips actually in it. I must try this. They also sell beer as everywhere here, and the staff are funny, so give it a go."
3,"Good place for a few drinks Nice Sofas (best for smaller groups of 3/4 on the one couch - bit difficult to talk across them) Or there's plenty of room to stand or take a stool at tables near the bar. Reasonable prices, enough room There's benches outside as well if you'd rather that in the summer"
4,"I've walked past this place at lunch time, and there's always a line out the door. I finally tried it today, and wow!! Excellent tasting ice cream. Very very fresh. You should go here if you're in the area and looking for dessert!"
1,"In the 'Portuguese' area of Hamburg, a large restaurant serving Portuguese food.  We were asked if we had booked so thought the restaurant must get very busy (it wasn't at the time we got there).  We were shown to a table in a reasonably empty restaurant.Felt the menu was a bit 'samey' and struggled a little to find something 'exciting' to eat.  Leaving the starters and go straight into the mains.  The food was OK but nothing to shout about.Staff were very friendly thought and accommodated my typical English and 'not speaking any other language'.  The restaurant never became busy so not sure about the fuss of 'have you booked'.  Probably would not rush back here but OK to come back if I had to."
3,"I give Xeom a solid four stars. It would be five, except that I really like Vietnamese noodle bowls (Bun), and theirs is pretty mediocre. The noodles are extremely thin and flimsy, and clump together in the bowl. If you like soup (Pho), though, then you're in good shape. Theirs is delicious (I had the chicken soup). There isn't much spice in the food, but there is a bottle of Sriracha on the table if you need a kick.The menu is pretty standard Vietnamese, with the aforementioned noodle bowls and soups, along with some salads and other specialty dishes. They have a large selection of drinks; I had the lemonade last time I was there, which was nicely presented and delicious.The dining room is small and cramped, and they're frequently packed for mealtime. We arrived around 12:30 for lunch and didn't have trouble getting a seat, but it gets packed around 1 PM. The chairs are all stools, and there are no coat racks, so you kind of have to make do if you have a coat with you.The staff is nice, and seems to all speak English, in case you need an assist. The prices are very fair. Overall, one of the better dining options in the city, just wish their Bun was tastier."
2,Good service. This place is well located and not over prices despite being across road from train station. Wasn't crazy for the pilsner beer I had but good selection. Food looks good from what I saw on other tables. Not a bad stop off but you feel like moving on from here eventually...
3,I had Mezze for lunch and I was more than pleased with my choice. The taste and presentation were tops and the portions were pretty decent. Very cozy restaurant and very friendly staff. Tip: it could potentially have mote tables
2,"Cute place for drinks and dinner!We sat inside immediately and started off with a glass of riesling and a cider as we reviewed the menu,Looks like this place is more popular for brunch as the pictures in yelp show an impressive brunch spread. The menu is mainly german fare. With a lot of noodle dishes. There was a tapas section and so we ordered the the baked cheese with honey to start. For our entrees, we ordered the noodles with turkey breast and mushroom sauce.The starter - was really good! The combo of sweet and savory for the baked cheese on bread was a great way to start our meal and I'd highly recommend it. The starter can be quite filling so I think it's best to share this with 4 people. We were only 2 so we were definitely stuffed after finished the starter and our mains. For our entrees, we received the cooked pieces of turkey breast with the mushroom sauce over it and had a bowl of noodles that came separately. They cooked a 2 person of noodles for us so that was nice. So you add the noodles with the turkey and mushroom sauce as you see fit. It was really good but very filling. I had to get a little to go box as I think the cheese and noodles filled me up! Next to pay, this was the first time we actually had to get up and pay in the front. We were waiting around for a while trying to get the attention of our waitress only to have her politely tell us we are suppose to pay in the front. We were more used to paying at our table but here just remember to pay in the front or you'll be waiting around for awhile.I'd come back to try the brunch and enjoy a beer or two!"
2,"5EUR entry costcheesy music... the kind of music you'd only expect to hear in german clubsi mean 80s and 90s music mixed with last year's songs and a bit of bob marley then some ABBA.The DJ thinks that by mixing, he's supposed to mix styles and songs...ok you get my point: Music - BADbut at least its full, its funnythere are a lot of people, which means a lot of weird people too. I am not sure id be back... not really my type of club but if u were rejected entry in the other hip clubs, try it out... you'll have a laugh"
4,"The best just got a lot better. Great, brand new restaurant that comes with a neat design and lots of new perks. Buns bakes in house, beef butchered in house, plus steaks (stunningly good) and a couple of neat new menu items. Obviously, the team is just warming up to the new place and things don't always happen at top speed, but then again it's fun to see them start up and help them iron out kinks by providing feedback."
2,"I don't normally go out for asian food (apart from sushi) since it has a tendency to either be meat-based or spicy (none of which I eat), but decided to take a shot at joining my coworkers for lunch here. I had the saitan dish - not that I had any choice whatsoever as it was the only vegetarian dish on the menu. The waitress warned me that it would have a ""basic spiciness"" but seeing as it was either that dish or no dish, I ordered it anyway. HOLY MOTHER JESUS OF NAZERETH THIS THING WAS SPICY. And delicious. And spicy. Too spicy. I couldn't finish my meal - had to run over to the bakery to pick up an egg sandwich instead. Have IBS like me? Don't go here."
3,"This bar is in ok. Giving 4 stars for the reason I once reviewed this place as another bar :D So, I suppose, this place has no face. It is just an ok bar with sofas and cheap drinks. It is a great place to go in between, but I would never say smthn like: Oh, lets go to the Roosen today!:)"
4,"This is a once in a life time experience!That was the best thing i have done in Hamburg since i got here.... Dialog in Dunkel offers you the chance to experience life as a blind person.Depending on the course you choose, you can spend between 1/2 and 1 h (i presume) in complete darkness - dunkel - being guided by a blind person through different rooms. Each room has a different theme, which you explore using your hands and other senses be it hearing or smelling.. you even get to a bar where u need to pay for your drinks this is something everyone in hamburg should do..."
4,Comfortable and minimalistic place with a cozy atmosphere. Friendly waitress and nice coffee and chai latte. Definitely recommendable for a quick pitstop during shopping!
4,"Mix with the locals and treat yourself to a phenomenal casual weekday lunch or early dinner at Fischfeinkost Delikatessen des Meeres (which roughly translates to: Fischfeinkost delicacies of the sea). This place is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a foodie, you have to check it out. If you're not a foodie, you should still check it out. The reviews are super impressive and very well deserved, and popular with the locals it is. Always a great sign, right?Ok, so here's the deal: you enter the space down a few stairs from the street level. You order your dish and a drink at the counter. The place is made up of a pretty cramped connection of tiny rooms with only a few tall tables around. Some with stools. Most without. But in pleasant weather, the great majority of folks are outside on the open sidewalk umbrella-covered tables that are pretty much full of people either enjoying their food or waiting for their food. When they have a bunch of dishes ready, they put them out on the counter and ring a bell. What? No, I'm not kidding. Then a bunch of customers just swoop right in and grab their dishes. Apparently everyone is a regular and already knows the drill, but I still have no idea how people know who gets what or when that bell ring is for them or not. Just bizarre, but it certainly seems to work. These are very happy diners, for sure. Luckily for me, the counter-lady was really sweet and clued in this rather clueless American when my dish was included in which bell ringing round.I had ordered the seafood lasagna w/carpaccio. Sounded amazing, and it certainly was. OMG. Happy me! Delic!! Lovely fresh pasta and veggies in a somewhat deconstructed lasagna style with a lot of yummy broth. Somewhat soupy. Just fantastic. The other dish available that day was a swordfish with potatoes on a bed of greens. Looked amazing and appeared to be the most popular. The Chef creates the menu each day of only 1 or 2 dishes, based on the freshest ingredients available in the markets that day. Brilliant! Simple concept. Simple food. Nothing fancy. Just fantastically prepared super fresh big plates of homey food. Everyone brings out their own flatware/napkin/drink to their tables, picks up their own dish from the counter when ready, and self-busses and drops off their dirty plates when they're done. Highly highly recommended!"
4,"Beautiful venue both inside and outside - has both indoor and outdoor seating, chilled out lounge area, the type of place you'd make your second home if it was your local :-) Great thin crust pizza, excellent beer selection, very reasonably priced. Seemed like a popular place to take your date on Thursday night as we were surrounded by couples. definitely will be back!"
4,"Good food and great service. I would have given this place 4 stars but added one star for the owner/chef who was personally serving us; this guy is great and funny too. It is a small place and so not good for big groups. They have a set menu (which supposedly changes every week or so) but if you like seafood, you should try it. The price is OK for Hamburg."
4,"A cosy place, next to u2 Hauptbahnhof. From ordering to getting food is just in a short while. Totally in  with their chicken avocado bowl. Absolutely recommend this place for everyday healthy lunch"
4,"Have been to this place a handful of times now and the experience never gets old. It's one of those you have to be appreciative of where you are type deal. Literally if you blink you will miss this place bc it's so small but the intimacy will never fade. Hands down some of THE best drinks I've had my entire stay in Germany. Service is impeccable and they also have a coat check. Hope that smoking is not an issue because they smoke indoors with the windows closed. This place is great to let your hair down without having to do the club two step of prepping, dressing up, meeting a guy/girl. You can just come here in regular clothes, grab a drink and make a new friend since you will more than likely be bumping into people even though you may not have been planning to."
4,"This place rocks! A great beach bar with a great Hamburg vibe. It's more off the beaten track than the inner-city beach clubs, and the vibe here is chilled and ""real"". Try the matjes-brötchen (matjes herring rolls), they're lovely, and I get told by Hamburg colleagues they are some of the best in town. A real bonus is that you get the nice evening sun here."
3,"Had a late lunch here with family after an appointment at UKE. Service was great and we ordered a biryani, baingan bharta and Punjabi paneer. All three items were very delicious. I will go there again on a special occasion."
4,"Wow! That's all I can say- this place was phenomenal! The ambiance, the staff and the food- OMG the food! Some of the best and freshest Sushi I have ever had. The ambiance of the place is fantastic- load but not too much, the staff great and watching the chefs cook in open kitchen helped make a great meal even better. 3 of us ate a literal boatload of Sushi and had a very nice bottle of wine, and it was only €50 a head."
2,this parlour is open all year round.strawberry ice-cream is recommended.don't go to tiramisu.
3,"Good! Maybe feels a little too casual, caféteria-like for the price level, but food quality was really delicious."
3,"Proper Irish pub. Went there once with a friend, had light snack and guinness. Beer is fantastic but food is bit too heavy. Place is quite small and dark but have good atmosphere and sometimes live Irish music."
3,"Great spot to hang out, just off The Reeperbahn and away from the craziness. They play great music, the bartenders are fantastic and the crowd are a good bunch. Since it is just off The Reeperbahn, it is GREAT people watching.....just park yourself by one of the windows, grab a drink and peer out at the mix of locals, tourists, hookers and the rest of the lot. You can easily waste away hours drinking and dancing (if there's room). I HIGHLY recommend when you inevitably find your way to this delightfully seedy part of town."
4,"We ordered chili cheese fries for appetizer off the board. I had The Jack, it was delicious. The meat was cooked at perfect temperature and they put a pretty good amount of cheese. I was afraid the blue cheese would be too strong but it wasn't. I added an egg on my burger for the hell of it. The bread they use are English muffin which is a nice change."
3,"Food: 5 stars    Value For Money: 5 starsIt only loses a star because the place has a grungy feel (the total look, the feng shui, as well as the feel of the table tops) but otherwise what you get for your Euros is completely superb.   The sheer variety of salad thingies that go on your falafel plate or into your wrap are just so tasty, so nurturing - - eating here keeps you alive in spades, on high octane.   And the smear of hummus,  and the droozle of tahini - - a bit of olive here and multiple veggie assemblages there,  this is flavor and substance and nutrition in heaping, power-pack format.   And those aromatic, hot falafels on a cool, multi-aspected salad plate - - the concept is knock-out, and the guys behind the counter are fast and adept.   Really, really good tucker."
1,"For my (maybe spoilt?) liking sadly the most boring breakfast throughout the whole Schanze. I refer to the Kostbar süß (sweet) now which had the character of a loveless canteen meal: tiny plastic packs of honey (1), Nutella (1), jam (1), cream cheese (1) and butter (1) slapped on a plate.Plus 2 biiiiig, flavourless rolls and a tragic slice of tomato, melon and cucumber. For the price of this (approx. 5 Euro without a coffee) I've had many much better breakfasts around town. Quite a letdown being only topped off by the bored and inattentive waitress. (- And they follow this pattern during the summertime, too, when you wish to sip a beer outside You could do a runner five times until these girls come to collect your money or orders.)"
3,"Trendy, cozy, chilled. Several standard drinks served on a high quality level make your night at this place. Enjoy yourself and your crew in between well off people of any age. The music is easy to listen and even if the place is crowded it is quite easy to keep talking and even more important listening ;-) The bartenders are really pros and they give you the drinks in a good mood and in a very reasonable time. You are looking for a place for a easy evening? Then this is the place you should truly consider.One star is missing because service time is reasonable, not best effort at any time."
1,"Clouds is a beautiful place to have dinner or drinks and I have been there several times. The food and cocktails are always delicious and I would say that they are worth the high price. As a grand finale to my mother's visit from abroad (and first time in Hamburg) I took her to Clouds the night before she flew the 27 hours home. Unfortunately this time I was utterly disappointed and have a particularly bad taste left in my mouth as a result of the service and tipping rationale. Our 'personal' waitress was abrupt and argumentative from the beginning when we simply asked if there were any tables by the window free. She then presented herself as our sommelier saying she could absolutely recommend the perfect wine to match our dishes and went on to dismiss the whole wine list and suggest merely the most expensive red and white wines on the menu. As a wine scientist I found this incredible considering the wine list has many options, and plenty that would have been a far better match. When attempting to discuss the wines with her she was dismissive and simply told me I was wrong by saying that Spätburgunder is the same variety of grape as Pinot Noir. I strongly recommend that your waitresses are trained in wine service (at least) before they claim to be sommeliers.Despite feeling hustled throughout our dinner we enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the restaurant. When it came to the bill I found the cost of the meal and a section below to rate our experience. Having not ticked a rating the waitress pushed me define if I was satisfied, happy or ecstatic with the experience. I was more than happy to give them a rating but found it staggering that the rating was accompanied by a percentage tip (already calculated from the total cost of the bill). Although I thoroughly believe in tipping when it is deserved and intended to tip for this meal too, being forced to tip is uncouth and a significant faux pas on the behalf of the restaurant management (who incidentally, were on holidays and not available to speak to on the night we were dining). My advice - train your staff in wine, don't force the tipping with satisfaction ratings on the bill."
2,"Ok. We came here mainly because both me and my wife's most favorite comic book character of all time is Batman. Yes, I know it is a city in Turkey, but we still had to try the doner kebab here because of the name...if not for all of the glowing reviews as well. If anything, the food here is a fantastic deal. It's seriously lunch and dinner for about €4. Many places only offer doner kebab stuffed in pita, but here they are well known for the durum doner which are served with delicious freshly made flatbread (it's really good!).The meat, however, we both felt was lacking in flavor and that is a pretty big component in the doner kebab itself. I know we will be back, but only after we've sampled around some."
4,"Possibly the most interesting museum I've been to. The three tours available have you navigate without sight, without sound, or with disabilities due to old age. I did the tour with no sight, and me and three other people were placed in a pitch-black maze with a blind tour guide. He guided us around in an amazing tour. I would definitely recommend visiting this museum if you're in the Hamburg area."
4,"One of the best experiences I have had at a restaurant - Franco the owner is amazing. The venue is small and intimate, but is filled with energy, fantastic service and the food is worth the wait. Franco took his time to really interact with his customers and that involvement makes the food and experience intoxicating."
4,"Uns hat die 1. Platzierung im Zeit-Newsletter hier her gelockt! Und wir kommen ganz sicher wieder! Steht nicht gerade eine lange Schlange von Eisliebhabern vor der Tür, ist der Laden recht unscheinbar und schnell zu übersehen.Die Wartezeiten sind kurz, und sollte es doch mal etwas länger dauern - es lohnt sich!  Es gibt ca. 12 Eissorten zur Wahl, darunter Klassiker wie Stracciatella, Schoko, Nuss, etc. Eine Kugel kostet 1,10 Euro. Für meinen Geschmack hätten die Sorten etwas ausgefallener sein können, aber dann entdeckte ich das Spaghetti-Eis auf der Karte! Da musste es auch gleich die große Portion für 4,20 Euro sein. Gott, was für eine Eis-Offenbarung! Ich habe noch nie so ein geiles Spaghetti-Eis gegessen. Super sahnig-cremiges Eis mit leckerer Erdbeersauce, weißen Schokostreuseln und eine gute Portion Sahne unter dem Eis!   Eisliebe hat ganz verdient den 1. Platz unter den Top Eisdielen in Hamburg verdient!"
3,"Very nice bar in the heart of Altona/Ottensen district - don't even try an attempt to come by car - either walk or if 5-10 minutes walk is too far, take a taxi/cab. They have 2 areas to sit outside - left and right of the entrance. No tables though, just some benches (beer garden style). Drinks are not better or worse than in other bars, but I like the atmosphere and you will directly spot why this place is called ""Reh"" (""Deere"") when coming inside."
3,"I dont think starbucks need an introduction or a description.It's starbucks! For those who don't know starbucks (although i doubt there are many of you out there) Yes it is self service! However, I, personally come to starbucks for their cakes. Please do try the Cheese cake (either new york or with jam) or the carrot cake and then thank me for my suggestion :) Enjoy! - and keep a bite for me :P"
4,Delicious I didn't know kebabs could be this good!
3,"This museum was so close to our hotel that we decided to check it out first thing in the morning.  We were not necessarily looking for anything specific but also wanted to see what they had to offer.  One of the special exhibits was all about video/computer games and it was so cool!  You get to play arcade/console/computer games that you haven't even thought about for years (or maybe you have).  I am so glad I stopped in for that alone.  The rest of the museum is ok, and will be especially interesting to you if you are more into furniture and design.  If you are looking for more art, check out some other spots around the city first."
4,After a truly grueling day we came here as a group of 8. Everyone left with content smiles. Perfect wait staff and excellent food. Love this place!!!!
2,"A Falafel place that is a bit more spacious so you actually enjoy sitting down and a bit cleaner than your average 'orient bistro'.Food quality is perfectly fine, flavours could much improve if they toasted the wraps / breads."
4,"I'm a massive fan of the Stadtpark, and now summer is just around the corner, I'm inspired to tell you why. For a decent program, I'd highly recommend renting a canoe and paddling your way through the canal network into the Stadtparksee, where you can promptly jump in (without paying!) and swim to shore. Then unload your picnic, beers and size 6 cricket set, and a happy afternoon will be had by all. It's advisable to use a windball instead of the real thing, lest you kill a baby and put a dampener on everything."
4,Germany's freshest. Simple place with super friendly staff. Excellent dishes all around our family of 4. Deserts were amazing too!  Given our variety of our dishes my conclusion is that you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!  Go!!!!
4,"I'm so glad I found this place!One cold, sunny Sunday I was in the mood for a walk along the river, some hearty soup, and a peaceful place to read my book. Then up pops coffee al volo on my Yelp page, as if it were meant to be. For me, this cafe has all the comforts of home. The staff are warm and friendly, the food is made with love, and you don't feel guilty for staying for a couple hours to read, chat, or study. Each time I've gone I've seen people there with friends, family, or by themselves; enjoying each other's company or catching up on some work. Overall it has a very welcoming, open, and comfy vibe. As much as I love exploring cafes around the city, I've also been searching for my go-to, all-in-one cafe. Finally, I think I've found it! Definitely becoming one of my weekend staples."
4,"Easily the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Great views and convenient location centralized in Hamburg. Right in the water! Friendly service, a blend of Italian and French food. This was more of a tourist location than for the locals which easier to navigate and order. Nice place to rest your feet for a while and enjoy an excellent meal. Try the chicken sandwich!"
3,"This is a lovely little local spot. Cash only. We went for breakfast and the server spoke enough English to explain the whole menu to us, and was really quite lovely. The bread is nice but not warm. The flavors are subtle - nothing really screams out at you but everything is nice. I got a plate with meat, cheese and bread and my husband got a tomato and salami scramble with bread as well. They go heavy on the butter here, which I like (it's served pate style so you can use as much or as little as you like). The food is fairly light. I wasn't hungry anymore once I ate here but wasn't super full either and ended up getting a buffet for lunch later. The latte here is an absolute highlight not to be missed. The foam is just perfection. No free refills on the coffee. All in all I'm glad we went but I wasn't impressed enough to go back a second time."
4,"We had a family lunch. The place is nice and food is good and tasty. A lot of German dishes, a bit heavy on condiments but this is my personal taste as I am not originally from Germany. We had a salmon burger, two regular burgers and a fish on a potatoes bed. Nice and fast service"
3,"Ah Rosi's Bar.. it's another of the almost identical bars on that side of Hamburger Berg. That mean's it's actually a pretty good bar, but you could just as easily pick any of 5-10 bars within 50 yards and have the same evening. - popular music? check.- dance floor? check.- cheap(ish) drinks? check.- good crowd? check.- free entry? check.- table football? check. Did I just copy/paste that review? Did someone copy/paste this bar?"
4,"The food is really good, the price is reasonable for what you get! The food comes a little late, which means is made fresh. And it was fresh! The personal are also very friendly. Next plan is brunch!"
4,"Who would think that Hamburg would make the best burritos in Northern Europe? Don't leave Hamburg without a late drunk binge eating extravaganza at Jim! It is worth every euro cent left in your pocket. Great art work on the wall, fantastic staff and food beyond your wildest hangover dream come true."
4,"Cafe Mimosa is a great little St. Pauli breakfast spot. There are two main options; cheese & meat or lots of cheese and both are great. The cheese breakfast comes with brie, goats cheese, mozzarella with tomato & balsamic vinegar, cream cheese, some other cheese, grapes, butter, jam, two slices of homemade bread, a bun and a coffee. Basically everything on the plate is of the highest quality, and they give you the perfect amount, so that you'll finish everything, but not want more. The cheese & meat option is the same except you swap the goats cheese & mozzarella for palma ham and some good quality salami. Great value at EUR6."
4,Great selection of top quality meat but most impressive is the wine list. This place is serious about wine with the biggest selection of American wine I have seen in Europe. The Sommelier was also really great she recommended a Ridge Zinfandel with a little age. It went great with our Danish dry aged (90days)! They even show all the meat dry aging. This is great for a date night or celebration. Price quality was on point.
1,"Nice place, simple food but tasty, yummy Hefe but when it came to paying the bill was furious to be charged for it twice- I still need to go back and get my money back!!"
3,We had shoyu ramen and miso ramen and they all tasted very good. The shop was very clean with friendly staff and warm atmosphere. I would like to come back to try other flavors such as butter corn or special shoyu ramen. The taste was quite close to what I had in Japan. I wish they have tonkotsu ramen as well.
3,We arrived Hamburg at noon and decide to get some burgers before going to the office. This place is pretty close to the city hall and rated well.I ordered the steak burger and fries and they both taste good. But the place is very hard to find since it's located in a food court in a shopping mall.
0,"Really horribly rude on the phone. The hours on yelp are wrong, I called at ten pm, could hear noise in the background but they stated it was closed. I asked what time it closed and he wouldn't tell me. Don't go here there are better places with superior customer service"
4,"Amazing. Menu is short  - like in very good restaurants. I tried Lamb and Sea bass, both were delicious. Note: they accept only chip cards."
4,"Klasse Laden, nette Leute! Toller Treffpunkt fuer allerlei Oldtimerfans"
3,"The food is basically very good. Nothing fancy. If you like Vietnamese style dishes this is pretty nice. If you are a fanatic about Vietnamese foods this will probably fall a little short. That said, I would happily return and enjoy a different selection. Nice folks. There is outside seating today (oct 2, 2015---it was a beautiful Friday in Hamburg)"
4,"Das Terzetto ist zu meinem Stammitaliener geworden. Ich habe dort schon meine Eltern, fast alle meiner Freunde und auch Kollegen hingeführt. Das Essen ist wirklich außerordentlich gut, der Service typisch italienisch ;-) und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis absolut in Ordnung.In der dazugehörigen Bar nebenan habe ich kürzlich zusammen mit einer Freundin unseren Geburtstag mit 40 Leute gefeiert (geschlossene Gesellschaft). Unsere Wünsche wurden alle erfüllt. :-)) Würde ich wieder machen!"
4,"Amazing coffee and extremely friendly baristas. Pour over coffees are superb and the cafe has amazing views of the canal. What is not to love about this place? On my second visit, I got wild and tried the food. No surprise, it was also incredible! I had the poached egg with spinach and avocado served on a huge loaf of fresh bread, all topped with coriander-basil pesto. Be still my heart! If you are close - come here, if not still come here."
4,"Very friendly staff, delicious food and not too pricy. They brought out olives, bread, and drinks as soon as we got seated and tolerated my terrible German. I've been there three times and I still have yet to try something on the menu that I wasn't very pleased with. Be careful around the bathroom area though, there is a sneaky hidden step and once I missed it and fell. Thankfully no one saw. But I would hate for anyone else to have the same experience."
3,"Great location, terrific food, tasty drinks. Very pricy but in total worth it. Do make reservations beforehand if you're interested in a table with view."
3,"Went once for the specialty/fusion sushi that is offered  awesome! So tasty and very creative. Fancy atmosphere, need to reserve in the evenings. More on the pricey side, but high-quality food."
2,"First of all, be careful when telling friends ""Let's meet at Bok,"" in ""Schanzenviertel,"" because for one, there are several chains in Hamburg and next, there are I believe three already in the Schanze area.   I first ate at the Bok on Susannenstrasse with friends from University when I moved to Hamburg, which we found was a nice meal, comparably to the Mensa (cafeteria) food that we more or less often ate on a regular basis.  This sushi bar is really great for students because it is casual, yet feels a bit upscale, but  affordable.  It is levels above Sushi Circle which I personally think people eat there simply for the entertaining factor of prepared sushi on a rotating belt.  Otherwise, instant sushi is never quite as delicious as freshly made to order. If I visit Bok, I like the location along Schulterblatt because during warm days and summer weather, they bring out long wooden benches to eat outdoors.  This street is great for dining outside with friends, people watching, and having some drinks well into the evening, then heading over to the several bars in the immediate area. I would go here if you prefer a variety of sushi choices, vegetarian options, like Japanese noodles, sitting outdoors in the warmer months to come and want to be in the midst of the buzzing Schanzenviertel neighborhood vibe, off the main street, at an affordable price."
2,The food was normal ... my sister and husband didn't finish the beef ... we have tried much better Persian food in Germany ... the staff were nice though .. price was good too ..
2,"We wanted to try out the restaurant because the reviews were quiet good. The first impression was good. The atmosphere is good. You can sit outside if you reserve a table in advance.We ordered a starter. A mixed starter plate cost 18€. Even though it is overpriced, it was delicious. For bread you pay an additional 4€. As a main starter we ordered homemade pasta with truffle (28€) and Pasta Aglio with scampis (18€). The homemade pasta with truffle was delicious. But still very overpriced. Pasta Aglio was really disappointing. Tiny four scrimps were added. Winterhude is known for the higher prices. We were very disappointed. I am willing to pay more if the quality and the service is good. This was not the case. We waited 1.5h for the main course. Service was not asking whether we want more drinks or have any other wishes. All in all this place is a overpriced. The service is not great. You need to wait a long time to be served. The dishes are not outstanding."
1,We were really disappointed by this place. The cheese on my cheeseburger was simply burned (like totally black...) and when we said something about it they said that it is supposed to be crunchy... okee this was NOT crunchy but burned. Eventually I got a new one which was better (as in the cheese wasn't burned)Both our burgers were not very special or really good. I would not recommand going here for hamburgers.The drinks were good so maybe this place is better as a bar
4,"Very cool little pizzeria just off the Reeperbahn in St. Pauli.  Order at the counter, then find a place to sit.  Don't be surprised if you end up sharing a table - they only have a few large tables and a few chairs at the counter.  Thin crust, good toppings, and a good selection of beers."
2,"Yes this is a strange one. This restaurant benefits from being in the middle of one of the busiest restaurant areas in Hamburg. So it's more or less always going to be pretty busy. So we were very grateful when we found a table here without having booked. Four adults and 2 kids, it was great, especially when they asked another table to shift off their place for us. Then we watched all night as they moved people around the place all night as new people arrived. I haven't seen that before! It was also freezing outside, but boiing inside, and every time the door opened (which was a lot) we all got a blast of icy air! Overall it wasn't bad, the food was OK, then we had a little dance at the end when we were told they didn't take credit cards but then when I pulled out my Qype wallet, hey presto all of sudden they did! Which was very strange!"
3,"I was walking around hungry in this fantastic neighborhood when this random German girl came up to me and suggested this place. And she wasn't kidding, the food here is top notch. Low key (meaning not fancy) decor, typical menu for this kind of cuisine but the quality is fantastic. I had the falafel with halloumi and it was fried on-the-spot...amazing. The counter is small and crowded, but service is brisk and you get your food fast even when there is a lineup (there is always one here apparently, which is a great sign). The crowd here is very mixed which makes it interesting. And it cheap, cheap, CHEAP (my dish plus bottled water around €5). Recommended!"
3,So cute and cozy and so schwäbisches 'comfort' Essen!  Everything is house made.  You have to order at the counter and they bring food to your table. My spätzle dish and my husband's Maultauschen tasted as if we were at my husband's relative's house in Baden-Württemberg.  Big portions.I had my schwäbisches essen fix at this place.
4,"Have always had a great experience here. The interiors are very cool and the cocktails are very good. Let's just say the drinks are complicated in a good way. Only problem sometimes, it can get super crowded."
1,"Recommended by many in Hamburg for some strange reason.  If at one point this was a top restaurant, those days are gone. Passable Italian food torpedoed by indifferent, insufferable, lackadaisical service. Do not want to be unfair to the kitchen, even if the food is not all that either, but the main topic of conversation between me and my dinner partner was the poor experience at Gallo Nero.  They do have cute empty bottles of wine lining the walls."
4,"Awesome, simply incredible food. Great atmosphere, great prices, four people, 2 starters, main dish dessert and lots of wine for 100 euro. Respect. We had the baked avocado with goat cheese and honey, luftgetrocknetes Rindfleisch ('carpaccio for People who don't like RAW meat')..Tortellini alla Panna - best ever. Tagliatelle with beef tips - best beef I have had in Hamburg, full stop. Pizza panna - those fenchelwurst! Awesome. Schweinemedallions in gorgonzola - rich creamy deliciousness. Just freaking go. Now."
3,"This is my first Vietnamese restaurant in Germany. It's a cute little restaurant with outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has metal dinning tables with small plastic stools reminiscent of restaurants in Vietnam (which I have just spent 3 weeks in prior to coming to Germany). The green tea is the traditional Vietnamese green tea that I love. I also had the shrimp spring rolls (summer rolls) that came with a fish sauce dipping sauce. The inside is filled with veggies and the very thin vermicelli noodles. Very tasty. I also had the beef pho. The usual hoisin sauce and the plate of vegetables on the side was not served with it like I am used to in other countries (US, Vietnam, etc) but the broth is very flavorful you almost don't need it. The beef is served medium rare over the boiling hot soup. It was kind of chewy but overall still good."
4,"RIB Happy Hour is awesome. 990 Euro for high-quality food. Forward: I walked by Jolie a few weeks ago and noticed two large guys rubbing their bellies after finishing off what looked like an entire pig. Both had plates stacked with bones in front of them. I asked a woman sitting outside(who turned out to be the owner) about the deal and she confirmed Happy Hour for Ribs on Wednesday, 990euro. Service: I returned for dinner last night. The owner was seated outside and seemed bothered that I was only there to eat food, not drink alcohol.  I was the only person in the restaurant so I would think my business would be appreciated. After a somewhat heated discussion about why I should order drinks whenever I go to any German restaurant, Claudia apologized and her smile came out, which was lovely. The waiter was young and jovial. Food: Dinner was great. Close to an entire rack of spicy-honey ribs, a small salad with sprouts, crispy potato wedges with sour cream and chives, and two pieces of perfectly grilled garlic bread. I don't even like garlic bread and I devoured the entire meal. A lot of food, a lot of great food for 990Euro. The ribs were overcooked in the slightest but not enough to warrant losing a star. The food was so delicious that it knocked the bad taste out of my mouth from earlier. I'll definitely be back with my girlfriend next week, and we will drink, and hopefully the experience will be even better."
3,"A great find! It's a small cozy place on a nice street. Really warm on a cold snowy night. They have 3 options for vegan spätzle which I was really craving. They recommended the ""cheese"" and onion one as the most traditional and I got it with smoked tofu as an option. It starts with a small side salad but then when the spätzle came out it was huge! It comes in a glass baking dish straight from the oven. The vegan ""cheese"" was really creamy. It was a bit of a struggle to finish it but it was so good! The staff were really friendly with perfect English. I'll definitely head back when I'm in Hamburg."
2,"Why go to Zoë 3 when Zoë 2 is literally nextdoor? It's a question I've only twice had an answer for. 1) Zoë 2 was too busy to get into2) Zoë 2 was closed, but then we realised that Zoë 3 was too They have upgraded this place recently with the addition of sofas, before that it really was tough to make a case for going in. I'm sure it's a fine bar, but you'll never want to go in."
0,Great wings. But worst service ever!!! Takes ages to get your food if and just if they do't forget it!
4,"Very nice smell as we walked in! A smell of fresh backed croissant. Pls reserve the table coz the cafe is not really big. Suitable for kids: baby chair, diaper change table and a box with books and drawing pens are available"
4,"Been there a couple of times and the staff is super friendly. Don't know if everybody, but they speak Spanish ;D.Sure, this is ""fake Mexican"", but even me as an honorary Mexican--lived there some years--I think it's tasty.Vegetarian options available if you're grossed out about meat for the day.My recommendations: burrito carnitas.And they can save you from starving to death since they close about the latest in the area."
4,I love the Miniatur Wunderland. It is a huge model train railway with several themes and countries. There a lot of details and it is impossible to see everything in one visit. Additionally there are buttons you can press to start a small action e.g. a fire and then all the firetrucks come to the building. Enjoy
4,The most beautiful building of old classic architecture in Hamburg. The Rathaus building was once described to me that it is so impressive because it is reflecting the self confidence of the Hamburgers and their love for the city. It think that is a pretty good description. :)
3,"I love a good dive burger place, and this place is really awesome! Came here for dinner and the place was packed, the hostess said that there were no tables available but the bar area was first come first served. There was plenty of room at the bar so it was easy for us to find seats. Immediately we looked at their chalkboard for their angry hour specials. Hehe, not happy but angry hour. There was a special for buy one get one free for the tap beer which we obviously ordered. Then we saw napalm wings for 25 cents each. We love hot wings so we of course did a half order of that. For the burgers, I went with a plain one as the burgers looked pretty massive and there was plenty of mayo and ketchup on the bar top for me to sauce it up if I needed to.For our drinks we ordered a couple rounds of the ratsheern red beer. It's a good light beer and I needed a couple of glasses once the napalm wings came around. When we ordered the napalm wings, our waitress warned us that it was spicy, we said. 'ja, we know'. Then she proceeds, 'No, IT'S REALLY SPICY!"" lol We were foolish and said, 'ja we like spicy!'. The waitress said ok.... and out came the wings! They were in a dry habanero sauce with a side of blue cheese dressing and some carrots. We took one bite and our lips were on fire. ok yeah.... napalm wings are REALLY SPICY! The flavor of the wings were still really good but I think I cried a little! So be careful when ordering the wings. It's a great deal when they are 25 cents but I'm really glad we only had 3 each. I could not finish 6 or a dozen!Ok, as my mouth was on fire, my burger arrived with a heaping pile of fries. I dove into the fries and couldn't really taste anything but burning. After the napalm wings heat subsided, I finally was able to eat my burger which was really juicy and delicious! I love how the english muffin soak up the burger flavor and I was able to eat the whole thing without a fork and knife :) Overall, it's a great place for great messy burgers! The staff is super friendly and were happy to speak to us in english or german. I insisted on german since I'm still learning and the waitstaff was patient with me and my shitty german :)Will be back for the burgers and I still need to try that cheesecake!"
0,"YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT! What you get is 2 sweet girls who understand customer service and one male manager who does not!1. What we ordered 4 cheeseburgers and 6 orders of chicken wings2. What we got 4 cheeseburgers on english muffin buns? 6 chicken wings?!French fries made with old stale oil.  ketchup, mayo----oops no napkins?3. A manager telling me HOW IT IS - mam your order is wrong because you ordered wrong!! hmmm I rememebr in 7th grade business class 101 ""The customer is always right"" NOT HERE-THE BIRDFu*kUVERYMUCH for your service"
4,Eins meiner Top 3 Lieblingsrestaurants in Winterhude. Die Trüffel Pasta ist himmlisch! Der Service wirklich sehr gut. Im Sommer kann man gut draußen sitzen. Drinnen ist es sehr gemütlich und klassisch eingerichtet. Kann ich nur wärmstens weiter empfehlen.
3,Good food! And you can smoke in the restaurant inside only tell the owner you're wife or your sister is having a child in the hospital then it's ok
3,"This is a very hip bar not far from Hamburg uni. The lighting is spot on, the venue is cleverly designed and has comfy seating arrangements and a great bar to sit at. The Barstaff are knowlageble and friendly and they have a 5 euro cocktail menu...the Cosmopolitains being so scrummy I wish I had of had time to order another one.There's table football and a DJ box with a Live DJ playing music that sets the tone but isn't too overpowering on your conversation. Located right near the cinema this is a great place to pop in pre film or afterwards. Bonus points for the decor, it's adorable....feel like going back though wiht a gold metalic marker next time and drawing a horn on all the little gold ponies painted on the wall as then it would be a unicorn bar wouldn't it?"
3,"Very nice and reasonable food in a casual set up, but a little small for big groups. The service was nice, the people are really nice but do not understand any language other than german so for tourists it is a little harder but pointing out what you want is never a problem. Very good for vegetarians."
3,"It's ""Australian"", but to be honest I've never noticed any antipodeans here. You can get average Australian beer if you like, but I recommend sticking with the German stuff. I've always wondered whether they'd show Australian sport on tv, somehow I doubt it (I've never really noticed any TVs), but maybe they do. Actually, randomly, the best thing about down under are their chicken wings. Plentiful, relatively cheap and with a myriad of sauces. They also do some decent burgers, but weirdly they come on toasted baguettes rather than buns."
4,"One of my all time favorites in the Schanze I must admit. Good music, good people, comfy chairs/banks/sofa's. Closing times are rather flexible so I hear (they close at 4am sometimes if there's people around). The look of the place is retro, but that is a normal occurance in the Schanze. It's not huge but it's big enough. Want to chill out and chat and have a cool bottle of beer? This is worth checking out!"
3,Fast and delicious!  Tried the wagyu cheeseburger loved how light it was . I would qlso recommended their mochi !
3,"Superb establishment. Everything everyone has said is true, I realised as much after my own personal cocktail consultation on massage Mondays! What do you like? What tastes, what spirits, what mood are you in? What's your favourite colour? What's your name, where'd you come from, how many. no wait. I got recommended a Hendrick's crush, which contains crushed kumqats! What an invention, a fruit that no one had any use for before, apart from ornamental, of course. Anyway, it was delicious. I've since been back and sampled the flammkuchen (also great) and watched the fish a lot. An impressive tank. On Monday nights every customer gets a free massage too - slightly surreal, but great!"
4,"I never thought I would be a fan of the currywurst..unless it is at 4am in the morning after a big night out where anything would taste good!! However, Curry Grindel has completely changed my viewand my tastebuds! They are brilliant and the chips are great tooand to think that this place is just at the end of my street! Great place for a quick snack and if you ever have visitors to Germany.this is the place to introduce them to the currwurst!"
3,"I thought this place was called Lahmacun, but I guess the sign also says Deniz Imbiss.. Anyway it's a pretty decent little kebab shop, I think - I was pretty drunk at the time I ate here."
3,The Goldfischglas is a nice bar at the Schanze. The menu offers the usual drinks and a few cocktails. It was very crowded and noisy. There is a tabletop football available. Enjoy
4,"Spent a whole evening here recently, and a great time was had by all. Free table football - big bonus. The idea of this place is it's set out like a three room flat. Walk through the front door into the kitchen/utility room. In the back there is a living room, then further back still is the bedroom (also where you'll find the table football table, oddly. Update: We went to 3 Zimmer Wohnung again last night and I accidently found out that theyve massively expanded! Basically I was looking for the toilet (having never been to them here before) and took a wrong turn in the maze downstairs which landed me in the table-football room. After talking to the barman it seems that they only opened the room up a few weeks ago. So the upstairs is the same 3 Room Flat that we've always known, but downstairs there is a new long room with a few sofas, a second bar and 6 table-football tables. Yes, 6. It's quite a cool game, but it's depressing how good all the locals are at it..."
2,"I really like what I ordered, a vegetarian burrito without the tortilla (allergic to gluten). I was a little surprised that they didn't have one gluten free option on the menu and think that the price was a bit high for the amount of food I got."
4,"I'm always a little leery of expensive restaurants with a great view. Most of the time it feels like you're only paying for the view and the food is an afterthought. Not the case here. The food is fresh, innovative and fantastic. The service is great. The view is amazing."
4,"This place is hard to find. Also, If you're someone who only leaves work at about 6pm, then you'll never be able to go, because they close at 6pm and only open on weekdays. Both of the above points are a shame, because this is a great little place. It's basically the Hamburg equivalent of good old British Fish & Chips, only in Hamburg they serve potato salad instead of chips. Portions come in three sizes, ""baby"" (3 pieces of fish), small (5) and large (7). I guess the names are meant to be amusing because a small portion would be more than enough for most people. Thankfully I had the good sense to order this. It's not particularly cheap; A small portion costs EUR8.40. However, the fish is excellent - it's just a shame about the location/opening hours because without taking a holiday I'll never be able to go back."
4,Tucked away just a bit but worth the walk. Friendly staff and stellar pour-over. Will return a number of times before leaving town.
3,A tasty and sensual combination of classic American diner food and Korean delicatessen. Every bite of the burger was juicy and filled with flavor. I'm looking forward to coming again and trying out more from this inexpensive and delicious hidden corner
3,Old pharmacy transformed into a student pub. Like the vibe and comparatively low prices. Main drink is beer.
4,"I am going to go ahead and give this place five stars. I'd be tempted to dock them one star due to the exorbitant pricing but to be honest, it's almost worth it. Yes, they are expensive and even more importantly, yes you knew this coming here. If you really think you are going to see this menu and not find it expensive then you shouldn't be here in the first place.Now, on to the food. Great, great steaks. Presented as steaks should be.....raw and on a platter for you to choose your cut. I had the ribeye (400g) which had a perfect blend of fat and meat and ordered it medium rare as quality meat should be cooked. Perfect.....not one complaint and I finished almost every last scrap of this cut, which very smartly came out on a hot plate......dislike when they don't do this with larger cuts as it cools off too quickly before you can finish it. The sides were just as good. We had the spinach, the beans with bacon and the steamed vegetables. Perfect.....everything just as I like it.Service is also top notch. We did seem to constantly have different people coming to the table...one for orders of starters, one for the order of drinks (bottles of wine in our case), one who brought the first course and so forth. Yet, everyone was super nice. Really liked this.One side note......and this is not meant negatively. I ordered some barbecue sauce to try it with the meat. This barbecue sauce was horrendous. I absolutely hated it. Yet, it doesn't mean it was bad. It just wasn't my style and I talked with the guy who seems to run this place about this. I very clearly told him I hated it but it didn't interfere with my meal at all. I was lucky I didn't pour it over my steak. One tip: simply keep the sauces on the side and try them before drenching your steak in them. You may love them. I didn't.Finally, if someone isn't going to eat steaks don't come here with them. My g/f for example doesn't eat steaks. Hence she won't be seeing the inside of Butchers. Don't get me wrong....I'd love to take her here but it's a waste. If someone isn't into meat, leave them at home and come here with your buddies......or preferably invited by someone with an expense account (as was my case!)"
4,Such an interesting part of Hamburg... A place where old meets new to the max. Even though it reminds me of Holland and Amsterdam a lot it has it own charm due to the new part Hafencity being add to the old Speicherstadt... Cannot wait for the Elbphilharmonie to be finished and see this area grow to a fun and interesting place. It could use some green and trees though... That is a pity... a leafy lane would work well here as contrast to both the new and the old!!!
4,"Authentic Italian restaurant that is said to be frequented by celebrities also. Wouldn't have wondered if I had met the Godfather himself there. You won't get served pizza, but tasty antipasti, pasta, and tiramisu. Luckily I didn't have to pay the bill!"
4,Owner was super friendly and gave us tons of tips about the best way of cooking the meat. The amount of food was really satisfying and as taste as it goes. We will definitely come back.
3,"Kardelen is an affordable Turkish place with dozens of solid meat and vegetarian options. The food tastes fresh, and there are daily vegetarian and meat options posted on a blackboard outside and showcased before the cash register behind a glass counter.I recommend the gemüseteller mit döner, which is aubergines, cauliflower, couscous, two falafel balls, yogurt sauce, and chicken or beef with a small side salad for 6.50€.The food here overall isn't amazing, but it's tasty and certainly worth the low costs. I've had a lot better döner kebab and falafel in Hamburg, but this is still a place I recommend for lunch if you're in the area."
3,"The Delta Bistro is really in quite an odd place! You'd be forgiven for thinking you were actually walking into a factory, because, well, you are! It's on the first floor of some sort of cash and carry which is part of the meat market here. You'll be walking down a deserted street that's fairly badly lit with parked lorries stacked on the pavement, and getting a little bit lost before you find it. Upstairs, the seating is very spacious, and the service, although not fast, very professional. Both starter (carpaccio de boeuf), and main (rib-eye steak) were excellent, and the Austrian wine we ordered was very drinkable too. I would tell you how much it cost but my date for the evening paid for everything too, what a bonus!"
4,"Great food, fast and friendly service, and good prices.I had some lamb chops here and they were absolutely spectacular! The lamb was very tender and full of taste. The rice was well-flavoured. The salad was made with a great variety of ingredients and was very zesty. The overall combination of flavours was well-selected and the layout of the food was really colourful.Although the outdoor seating has a very 'fast-food BBQ' sort of feel to it, the indoor seating looks much more like a restaurant. The décor is colourful and lively, and the place does have a rather 'busy' feel to it.I'd recommend stopping by here if you're in the neighbourhood."
2,"Had a quick lunch in this Portuguese quarter near the clock tour on Sunday. Pleasantly surprised I must say. There are so many restaurants at this corner it's a bit confusing as to where to go. The lunch plates were about 15 euros each, and we had two entrees among the three of us. One was grilled squid plate, which was excellent, and the other was what seemed to be white fish fillets cooked in tomato cream sauce. The latter is also decent and gets three stars. The service was not outstanding but was acceptable. Clean bathrooms. Can't complain and did not regret going."
2,"Staff here are really super friendly! They seem serious about their coffee with lots of options on the menu.But it's not a cozy or comfortable place where I'd want to hang out for long, a second drink etc..My non-coffee drink (chai latte) was rather lukewarm, flavour on the dull side. The many happy Yelp voices suggest that coffee drinkers might be luckier here."
4,"I've been traveling in Germany for 2 weeks and this is the best flat white I've had so far! Double shot, right amount of milk and foam. Very velvety! The dark chocolate cookie was also great! The baristas are super nice, made recommendations when I was having trouble decide what to get (their menu is large!). Nice interiors and outdoor seating. Free wifi which is great if you want to work."
4,"Really good quality meat. Hefty portions for very reasonable prices, especially take away. Really friendly staff who know their stuff & always put a smile on your face when you go in (think it's family owned)."
3,"A really excellent venue, we came here since one of our daughters came here for a birthday party  it's the perfect place to tire out a large group of tweenagers! Since it was Winter (December) when I visited, I only managed to see the main indoor courts but it is a pretty amazing facility, with a number of huge indoor sand courts interspersed with rest areas and a central cafe. Surprisingly out of town, however its not far from the nearby u-bahn station so easy to reach on public transport."
3,"Rather interesting town hall area - large and fairly impressive. To any tourists, it is not a place you need to plan into your trip, as I found I inadvertently passed through the area several times whilst crisscrossing the city trying to see different sights. Not saying the town hall is not worth a stop, the architecture is worth a picture moment in its own rights (and I am not a buff in that area, to me, it looks nice), but given the location, it is easily reachable from different ends of the city. Visited during Spring, so the area was pretty lively and picturesque. Would definitely be on my list of interesting places in Hamburg."
3,"What a night! Went with a group of 11 and were treated to a tapas style meal selected by the owner which included four flavourful seafood courses: sea bass, sword fish, shrimp flambé and Canadian halibut.  A truly authentic Portuguese dining experience including a beautiful acoustic serenade throughout our meal.  Highly recommend."
4,"Delicious! Great environment, friendly staff, and delicious ice cream- all for a great price!!! They also have vegan options. Would highly recommend!"
3,"This is the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Hamburg last week. What a great way to kick off a stint in a new city - with a go-to Ramen spot!My husband and I arrived around 6:40pm on a Wednesday night. It was very busy and we ended up waiting for over an hour for a table for the two of us. After a few minutes of figuring out how the line worked, we added our name to the list.We tried to order gyoza, but they were out. We ordered the fried chicken instead and OMG. It was so juicy and delicious. My only complaint is that we couldn't eat it all, otherwise we wouldn't be hungry for our ramen. For the main course, I ordered the Shio with Egg and Seaweed and my husband ordered the Miso ramen with corn and butter. We were both pleased with the ramen.I can't wait to go again to try out the other types of ramen that they have available!"
1,"The view is great - and that's basically it. Knowing this location for several years now, one must say that the quality decreased over time. Nowadays the cocktails are too pricy for their quality (for example Boilerman, Le Lion Bar de Paris are better options). On top the service is slow and needs to be constantly reminded of previous orders."
1,"Disappointment! I have tried their cheesecake before, they are really rich and creamy! But today I decided to try their lunch. Since they went vegan, something has happened to this place. They portions of their cheesecakes have been reduced, and the food options have been limited. The menu says that they offer the best vegan burger in town,  (Honestly, I really really hate to give bad reviews) unfortunately it was really dry and lacked taste. The ""fries"" were also soggy,  so maybe it could be great if instead they could do a salad. Maybe it was a bad day. :)"
4,"This is a slightly ""hidden"" restaurant in the Hamburger Hof on the Jungfernstieg. It's my local coffee place as our offices are very nearby. Most people don't know this place by name but have probably walked by it often if they live (and shop) in Hamburg as it is quite central and everyone has walked through the Hamburger Hof at some point. They have very good coffee and the food is quite good. It's a fairly standard type of fare but is always good for a quick meal. I really don't order anything else except for breakfast type things in the morning or salads for lunch but these are favorites of mine. The service is also quite good and there is one waitress who's been there forever who is super nice. I can't remember her name though. The seating is also good because you can be inside, or outside/inside since the ""Hof"" is a ""Passage"" and you have variety in terms of people-watching. Further, they also have seating on both side of the Hamburger Hof completely outside which is nice in the summer months. Finally, it usually isn't overfilled so you can always find a place to sit."
4,"Some of best fish ever, and excellent service. Had a great food experience. Will come here again :)"
0,"Sehr enges Restaurant und nur mittelmäßiges Essen. Noch nie so hektischen und genervten Service erlebt. Man fühlt sich wie am Laufband. Hauptsache man ist schnell wieder weg und der Tisch ist wieder frei. Nicht mal 45 min waren wir dort und das unter der Woche. Man wurde von den Kellnern regelrecht belästigt und nach dem Essen wurde einem einfach die Rechnung auf den Tisch geknallt. Unergründlich wie dieses Restaurant so beliebt sein kann, da werde ich meinen Abend nicht mehr verbringen."
3,Recently vastly improved Italian restaurant. Al fresco dining at a reasonable price.
2,"It's big and interesting. That's about it. Oh, there was some kind of food market/festival going on out front of the place. History buffs will probably find this one a gold mine. frankly, I have a hard enough time keeping track of my own history, much less hundreds of years of shipping industry happenings, so I was more impressed by the architecture than anything."
4,"Decided to come here for Sunday brunch while visiting Hamburg based on other reviews. It didn't disappoint! The breakfast offerings are outside of your traditional German (of course) but are superior in my opinion. Large portions, plenty of flavor, lots of choices. We were able to get seating immediately (lucky) around 1100. The service was relatively quick and the staff was very friendly. Prices were extremely reasonable and the two of us ate for under 20€. There was a mix of clientele; this restaurant is not just for Turkish or Arabic people. I recommend picking up a variety of the baklava and other sweets on your way out as well. I will be back if I'm ever in the area again!"
3,"The Kopiba is also known as ""Deathpresso"" Café.  It's their home brand coffee bean and is alsoactually the big sign outside above their entrance... so don't be confused when ppl tell you they'll meet you at ""Deathpresso""This leads us to the next fact: Kopiba is all about coffee and Espresso and they have an excellent selection of self-roasted coffees to have there and to buy. The staff is always willing to help you select the espresso bean that you want.It's a small café but intimate and cozy. On weekends they serve a breakfast buffet which contains just anything that you will need after your long night out in St Pauli.DO TRY their waffles!!!! They are absolutely amazing!!!"
4,"Utterly charming, and obviously -- people know! My husband and I were taking a stroll around beautiful Hamburg on our last day, and happened to find ourselves faced with a 2 hour wait at the Miniature Museum (next time). A quick pop of the Yelp app and we found ourselves at Ti Breizh devouring gorgeous crepes within a few minutes. Now, this was midday on a Sunday -- it obviously gets very busy and is very popular, so typically reservations are recommended. This Breton-inspired, white wash wood interiored gem was just what we needed after a long night and heavy morning of walking. I chose the Nordic savoury crepe with loads for smoked salmon and fresh dill. Mmmmm, so nice. Served with a nice side salad. Though we weren't toting our toddler, it did some very kid friendly (at this hour anyway) with several children at most of the tables near us. Kid chairs available and by nature, crepes are very child approved! There's a small shop in the front selling clothing that fits the theme (ALL stripes), unfortunately they closed before I could finish eating so I didn't get a chance to peek around. I likely would've bought something, too. 5-stars easily -- sometimes there is a reason a place is so popular, and the reason at Ti Breizh is because it is fantastic. Next time -- dessert crepes with nutella and wine for days. Delightful."
4,"Visiting from New York, it's not always easy to find great espresso bars in Hamburg. This is an excellent one."
4,The food was amazing. So delicious!  I had the stuffed chicken leg. Fantastic. Husband ordered a simple salad and it was also delicious. Wine was rich and just what I wanted after a week of beer in Bavaria. Highly recommend.
3,"I chose this place based on the comments on qype!It's a small restaurant/café in the Hamburger Hof 'mall'.We got there on a tuesday at around 6pm. It was empty, so we got to choose the table we found most appealing.The menu has a wide variety of food including salads, soups, pasta and pizza. They also have the Menu of the day which is written on a blackboard. It includes dishes that arent listed on the 'normal' menu.They also have an extra coffee menu. I had a salad, the rucola/schafkäse salat, which was really really good. The portion is rather generous. It's not very expensive.Two persons, 2 drinks was at around 20EUR. Very fair for what they're offering. I'll definitely be back"
2,"Yesterday I decided to try something new and close to home. I went with my friend to have nice tapas. Overall it was nice, would like to give them 3.5 Starts. The service was slow, it seems they could not handle the amount of people. But the wait shorten when the food came,  in less than 5 minutes after ordering we had almost all our dishes. The tapas where ok. Unfortunately the boquerones were not as fresh as they can be. But either way, everything tasted delicious. The perfect balance from garlic and spicy. Just the Pollo al Limon, was not my thing. In my opinion it was a little pricy for what we got, but for the area I was not so surprised."
2,"Atlas Restaurant is somewhat hidden in a relatively modern business district in the northwest of Altona. Like some of its surroundings, the restaurant oozes a bit of the red brick loft style that was so fashionable a decade ago. Unfortunately the dining room was rather empty on the evening of my visit, which - together with the empty (except for the cloth and a single candle) tables - made the place feel a bit barren. Service was fast and friendly throughout the evening and is one of Atlas' strong suits. The food, on the other hand, was a bit of a mixed bag. The evening menu is competitively priced (at 28 Euros per head) and includes three courses, which leads one to expect above-average, brasserie style cuisine. The salmon tartar starter was accompanied by pulpo, melted tomatoes and pickled cucumbers - a combination I personally didn't quite understand. The salmon tartar was decent, if a bit bland on its own, but how the other elements should be combined harmoniously eluded me, despite many attempts. The main, Boeuf Bourguignon, was better: the meat was tender and the sauce rich (in a good way), only the vegetables were slightly too tough.Desert was a lovely mousse au chocolate cake with pistacchio ice cream, which left very little to be desired, indeed. Atlas Restaurant is offering more than decent food at a good price. Maybe I'd just caught the wrong day of the week, but I'd probably not go there for dinner again, if the place is always as empty in the evening. Just in terms of food there is little to keep one from exploring the backyards of Altona."
3,"There is some construction going on at the street end and so it is not very easy to locate the cafe. Cafe has a very nice seating arrangement - nothing too overwhelming and you get enough space for yourself.. both inside and outside. Prices are not superhigh - though the coffee I ordered wasn't the best I had in a while. But, nice friendly staff and you really feel that you have come to a small home driven cafe in a positive sense. Very close to the station - so you dont need to walka lot..."
4,"So I have had some good Italian meals and last night we came here as a work group and some visitors from out of town. This experience was pretty special.We all went for the taster menu and the whole thing was just fantastic.15 year old super viscous Balsamic vinegar, extra first pressed Sicilian olive oil, angel hair spaghetti with truffles, carpaccio of smoked tunafish, melt in the mouth Tiramisu great wine, and really good service.A really good place to enjoy incredible Sicilian Italian food outside on a warm evening. Not the cheapest, but one of the best."
4,"Food was delicious!! Specifically the prawn coriander dimsum. I even forgot to take the picture. . We also ordered another chicken dimsum (this was a bit ordinary), cashew chicken and fried fish. All of them were super tasty. Probably best chinese food i have ever eaten in Germany."
4,"Excellent Hunan style food with an extra menu in Chinese: some customers were Chinese  always a good sign. I went there with a Chinese colleague and let him order. We had some great ribs, duck, lamb, chicken and also a Sezuan style spicy beef soup/stew which was amazing. Possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had."
4,"We went there on our last evening of our Germany trip. We had high expectations, and were afraid that they might not be fulfilled, but they were! The good was amazing! We had pulpo and bruschetta as an entree and Himachi and entrecôte as a Main course. Everything was delicious! The Location is really nice and surprisingly not that loud as I expected. Our waiter was really kind and nice. She checked regularly if the wine and beer were empty or not. Btw, the White ""House wine"" was really good! We will come back next year when we will be the next time in Hamburg"
4,"I think this is my favourite park in Hamburg. It's huge, I've probably seen only 10% of it but it's the perfect place to be on a sunny day. It's never too crowded, not sure because of its size or because people prefer going to Elbstrand. In my opinion this is definitely a plus, since one can really do what he wishes, chill, read a book, play football, Frisbee, grill etc. without being hassled by the people around. There are even a couple of museums in the middle of it. I don't want to spoil this place too much, come and check it out in person. In my opinion this is a MUST see during summer time if you live in Hamburg."
