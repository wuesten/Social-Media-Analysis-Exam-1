3,"I have walked by this place many times, an I guess I was too busy window shopping to notice this restaurant! Breakfast all day?! And I didn't know about it!? That is a crime. I ordered the French Breakfast at 15:00. It came with two buttery croissants, jam, nutella and honey. I had a sweet tooth, and this ""breakfast"" definitely cured it.  The juice was fabulous. Maracuja (passion fruit), orange and strawberry. Unfortunately the little fruit flies also know that they use fresh fruit in their juices, and they enjoy hanging around for a taste.  Will be back, especially to try other juices."
4,"Unbeatable, this place. you walk in and feel as if you were in Little Italy in New York in the 70s. Wooden decos, tables, original old-fashioned floor and no-English speaking personnel. Well, what the hell. The food is more than gorgeous, even if you have to fight through the linguistic issues. Feels lile Mamma is serving you personnaly, for those who've been in Little Italy at the above mentioned period of time. A must go."
2,"Spent a very pleasant evening here recently. We were holding a small celebratory dinner with 5 business colleagues. The ambience was relaxed, friendly but just formal enough to make it appropriate for this event. Cox has a French feel to it with a menu and wines to match and what looks like a decent small bar alongside, though we didn't get chance to use it (the restaurant was very accommodating given that we put back our arrival by 1.5 hours!)."
3,I've always had good food every time I've been here and always very reasonably priced. Today I had a pollack (seelachs) fillet with rice. It was great.
3,"Yummy food, good service and a cozy atmosphere-- Das Dorf serves up a very nice German dining experience. Before our trip to Hamburg, we made a reservation at Das Dorf for a Saturday evening. We arrived for our reservation and was seated right away. The place doesn't look very big at first, but they definitely take advantage of every single corner available. The atmosphere is cosy albeit you're cramped into a cellar.I had the stewed ox cheeks and my husband had the schnitzel. The ox cheeks were very flavorful and the schnitzel was good. The portions were generous and the service was nice and fast. I would recommend Das Dorf for a nice dinner in Hamburg."
4,"Omg I love their non-alcoholic cocktails! The best I ever have had and I will never forget the 'summer love' (yogurt, mango, white chocolate syrup, maracuja and cranberry juice) and 'kiwi twist virgin' which was pretty sweet but sooo tasty. Their food is amazing as well and I will definitely come back again in their happy hours because the drinks are big and affordable!Venue:Great for groups but it's pretty loud after working hours!  Loud, mainstream club music and a weird mixture of business ppl and youngsters. Not really a restaurant but a nice place to have drinks before you go clubbing!"
0,We decided to give this place a second chance.Fortunately we had the same terrible experience like on our previous visit.The food is still terrible and the staff has absolutely no sense for hospitality whatsoever.It's really interesting that the management just responds to positive feedback here on yelp but doesn't seem to care about bad customer experiences and / or how to learn from them.
2,"I was taken by a friend here. Had heard of it before but never actually thought of going. I was quite excited to find another steak place as I love good meat. Anyway, came here to first be greeted by the horrible smell at the entrance of the buidling. OK, it's a meat market so I can understand the smell but it's just not the first impression you want when walking into a restaurant. Once upstairs, the decor is a bit bland and old fashioned. The night we were there it was also packed with senior citizens. We were by far the youngest there (outside of staff) and we're in our mid-thirties. Nevertheless, the steak was OK. I wouldn't say it was anything more than average though. I found the meat a bit tough as well. Service was quite good on the night we were there but in summary, decent meat and good service is the opposite of what I expected. Actually had the meat been better, I would of cared far less about everything else."
3,"I believe this was the first burger joint we dined at in Hamburg and it is still one of my favorites. Yes, the burgers are hard to eat because the patty is shaped pretty much like a baseball and everything is contained between two small english muffins. But everything I've ordered here has been delicious and satisfying. The fries have that homemade quality and you get a lot of it. If you still have room after the giant plate of burger and fries, you have to have the cheese cake, self-proclaimed as the best cheese cake in the world. I believe it! The staff is nice and friendly. Always a good time and delicious food to be had here."
4,"This is a slightly ""hidden"" restaurant in the Hamburger Hof on the Jungfernstieg. It's my local coffee place as our offices are very nearby. Most people don't know this place by name but have probably walked by it often if they live (and shop) in Hamburg as it is quite central and everyone has walked through the Hamburger Hof at some point. They have very good coffee and the food is quite good. It's a fairly standard type of fare but is always good for a quick meal. I really don't order anything else except for breakfast type things in the morning or salads for lunch but these are favorites of mine. The service is also quite good and there is one waitress who's been there forever who is super nice. I can't remember her name though. The seating is also good because you can be inside, or outside/inside since the ""Hof"" is a ""Passage"" and you have variety in terms of people-watching. Further, they also have seating on both side of the Hamburger Hof completely outside which is nice in the summer months. Finally, it usually isn't overfilled so you can always find a place to sit."
4,"The light show is really beautiful. I wasn't going to go, but changed my mind at the last minute. I quickly taxied over from my hotel and got out and ran to the park. I was able to make it there by 10:15 (it starts at 10:00) and the show lasted until 10:30. I sat on the side of the lake opposite the large tower on a cement block. It put me the closest to the fountains of anyone, but this also meant I got pretty wet. If you don't mind getting wet, I would also recommend going for that seat."
2,"My local restaurant.  The food is good the drinks are great, it's just the service which could improve.  I like an experience and warmth.  As a business owner, feelings are everything.The basil smash is nice if you like interesting herby cocktails! If you're around here, Holla at me"
3,"Really solid coffee bar that has just about everything you would expect. It was just across the road from my hotel and I fancied a coffee so I popped in and was happy with the experience.  The only downside (missing part) of this place is they had no filter coffee at all, it was completely espresso based.  Still I went with a flat white and sat at the window and watched the world go by. There was a good view and the service was friendly. It is styled as most coffee shops are these days. Fairly minimalist in its approach with a less is more attitude to furnishings. They of course have lots of wood finishing , stone finishing , big tables and a fancy (la marazocco) traditional espresso machine.The main thing is the flat white I had tasted great, the service was good and I spent a peaceful and relaxed 15 mins people watching in a nice location."
4,"Some of best fish ever, and excellent service. Had a great food experience. Will come here again :)"
4,Incredible quality coffee. We ordered coffee on ice with hafermilch. It was deliciously creamy with perfect taste of incredible coffee. Nice modern interior! If you crave good quality coffee - this is your spot! I am not a coffee drinker but this one will make me turn into one
1,"Definitely overrated here on Qype. We had reserved at Taparia and they screwed up our reservation. Will next be docking their review on here but Casa del Sabor comes first. Right off the bat, I want to say we received very polite service. Place was packed and the young waitress did her best to get us a table. All is well at this point. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. First off, the food is mediocre. We had tapas primarily and had ordered six different plates. Each and every one of these was bland if not downright bad. The turkey with ""devil sauce"" (whatever that is) was horrible. The chorizo with white beans was also disappointing. The meatballs in tomato sauce we also just bland. The other plates.....completely forgettable. Worse than the food was the house wine. I am convinced it was watered down. Either it was a horrible 2 Euro bottle from Aldi or some other discounter or they added water to ""stretch"" it. One way or another, bad. Anyway, too bad that the food just doesn't work here. It seems genuinely Portuguese and could be a great little place to come for good food. Unfortunately, they've long ago stopped focussing on quality food and just rip off tourists at this point. In this part of town you'll fill your restaurant without even trying. Shame, since our waitresses were so polite. (Maybe they actually listened to the few poor reviews on here from others about service. I'll cross my fingers that they do the same with the food.)"
3,"Great vegan restaurant. The food is tasty, the place is cosy and the crew is cool. Best vegan quiche I ever eat !  The blueberry pie is great too.The missing star is for the really slow service : 40 minutes to get my dish."
2,"Pony Bar is probably the undisputed No.1 bar in the Univiertel - which means that this is the place for you if you like a hip crowd, shabby chic and reasonably priced drinks. I went there for breakfast, which (I guess/hope) isn't exactly their speciality. The trouble started when it became clear that rolls would only be available 45 minutes after opening - on a Sunday. Service never fully recovered after that bad start and orders took their dear time to arrive. The rolls, once they arrived, were of mediocre quality, which should probably be expected given the rather low prices. Espresso, on the other hand, was excellent when the one waitress prepared it. Her colleague's effort some while later wasn't that nice. My advice would therefore be to go there for afternoon coffee or a drink at night, but not necessarily to make a detour for the breakfast. Unless you're a coffee fetishist, got a lot of spare time and are on a budget, that is."
4,"I seriously can't believe that I forgot to review Gloria. Busy busy I guess. Anyway I've been a few times for their Sunday brunch buffet. It's not cheap at EUR13, but boy is it good! Check out the photos..."
3,"A restaurant full of surprises . The food was good (altho the pork chops felt a little bit overcooked, were pretty chewable still), the environment was romantic and relaxing. We also had small house salads for free and a typical Croatian shot for each person on the house.The price was very reasonable too (35 € for 2 people).But the menus they had were only in German and Croatian , and the waiters were not too good at English, being unable to explain what each course contains . Overall it's a very good restaurant and I'd definitely go again."
4,"This vegan restaurant made my Hamburg experience so much better! The food was amazing, with a great selection of different food all for a very reasonable price. The staff was wonderful, and the place was decorated with a very cute theme. The bathrooms downstairs were really nice and chock-full of amenities. I will definitely be coming back here!"
4,"Wonderful new little cafe serving home cooked food and thoughtfully sourced coffee and teas. The owners are kind and passionate about the quality of the ingredients they use, which hasn't gone unnoticed by locals as they regularly sell out of what they have on offer. There are also items from their family farm for sale and free wifi :)"
4,I can't be better :) I love it. I had lived Sheldon cooper's dream for few hours :)
4,Great place. Good prices. Cozy and comfortable. Air is filled with scent of coffee and tasty cakes. Perfect spot for a coffee after a meal at Fish & Co.
3,"Have been here for the first time. I certainly took a while until we got served. And it even took longer until the food was ready... But both, Pizza and Pasta were really great though, do it's worth the time!"
2,"Of all the cities in Germany I've been to, the Hamburg Rathaus was probably the most structurally appealing that I've seen.Really just like any other city center though... lots of shops, stores, restaurants, busy area of town."
4,"A friend of mine brought my mom and I to Plat du Jour for lunch.  It was so cute and French, packed with businessmen and women for lunch.  What a spot to truly enjoy well made food with a lovely ambience.  I had to go back, so I brought my boyfriend and his sister one afternoon.  We each ordered the steak because it sounded and was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant forLunch with friendsLunch with business partners"
3,"I met a friend for dinner the other night and we had a great time. We decided to share a pizza (because they are enormous) and salad and decided of half Hawaiian / half spicy sausage. When the pizza came, it was already cut in two with half of each kind on a plate for both of us. Man, Germans think of everything!The restaurant was quite busy on a Thursday evening but we managed to get a table in just a minute or two. You can grab a hefeweizen at the bar while you wait.Overall, I think the Yelpers are spot on about this place: a solid 3.5+ stars for pizza, salad, and beer. I'm rounding up to 4 because the waitress brought me an English menu without me having to bear the embarrassment of asking. Danke schoen!"
1,"Too expensive, poor food, really bad service. Nothing new in this part of town. They truly did their best to fullfill the low expectations for this part of town. Basically the majority (actually all) restaurants I'm the area are quite bad. Some are just less bad but none can be defined as really good. It peeves me that they get away with it because of all the tourists who come through here. Anyway, another reminder to remember not to eat in this part of town. Only place even worth considering is Taparia. Forget the rest."
0,"Horrible. For food that is nothing special and found exactly the same, but cheaper all over the city. Don't bother here. Service topped off my bad experience. In the confusion of not understanding German. I accidentally took the pommes of the lady in front of me. Realising what I had accidentally done, the chap serving me told me that I would be getting one less sausage and instantly took one off my plate before serving it to me. Wow. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible way to treat a customer."
4,Honestly a must try if in Hamburg! The burger bowls are to die for. We also had cakes for dessert and they were AMAZING!!! the staff was really friendly too.
3,"Nice location, stick to details and definitely worth to visit. I think the entrance is all little bit high, but at he end of the day, u should visit it, when u are in Hamburg"
0,"Very disappointing! I am German and I am used to quite a bit of bad service but this was a new level of rudeness. I could go into details about our stay there, yesterday, but I will just leave it to some examples: We were 8 persons, after taking the orders of 5 of us, the waitress lost interest and started fo collect the menus so I had to insist to get my order and those of my kids to her, too. Later they brought the wrong cakes for two of us (taking notes sometimes makes sense!) and kind of blamed us for it. We eventually took that cake to avoid a scene but it didn't taste very good. We were never asked if we want more coffee or drinks, the Apfelschorle I had wasn't really cold (it had almost 40C outside) and ice cubes seem to be unknown to them. When a motorcycle parade passed the restaurant, they refused to close the door, so we couldn't have a conversation for 15+ minutes due to the noise. I could go on but just want to add at this point that the place wasn't packed. In fact it was quite empty. I do not recommend this Schönes Leben."
4,"OMG.... great coffee - fair prices- great authentic atmosphere- super friendly staff! I arrived after a long trip and was super tired - was greeted with ""moin"" and felt like home straight away. I ordered a large cappuccino and the ""katzenfrühstück"" ... basic scrambled egg with Toast! Simple but delicious"
3,I am not normally a fan of places like this but I have to say that my fist visit to Sausalitos was more than pleasant! It seems to be a great after work place that has become adept at making sure groups of friends can enjoy an after work cocktail (half price until 8pm) and some tasty mexican food. The atmosphere is buzzy and the music cranks up a bit later in the evening (maybe that was the strange looking blue cocktail I had?) The service is swift and friendly an nothing seemed to be too much trouble. I will be going back soon to try the extra stron Chilli!
3,"Young, fresh, cozy as well as dynamic place.Very good and friendly service.We had poached eggs with avo, pesto, spinach on bread. Delicious!Waffle, other bread and dishes look perfect as well.Coffee (espresso and cappuccino) were excellent.The home made maracuja lemonade was just refreshing WOW!One star reduction, as we wait for 30 minutes (ok, I didn't know before). Reservation online only and no table free the next two weeks.In general perfect for the business. However not for spontaneous brunch people."
4,"My favorite attraction in Hamburg. If I have friends who are visiting, I bring end our tour of the Speicherstadt and Hafencity with an outing to Miniatur-Wunderland. I've been several times now and am never disappointed. You can spend hours just looking at everything. Great if you have kids with you but grown-ups will love it, too."
0,"Busy place - which does not honor table reservations. We arrived with a party of 20 - and had, of course, a reservation. We were told to wait outside, in a long queue. We left."
2,"Surprise to find this place. Food are not bad,  but not surprisingly good anyway. Very friend staff, we really enjoyed it. We like the duck and dim sum which are very good. The beef rice noodle are so so, could be worse. The owner seems well connected so he has many pictures with famous politicians."
1,"The only reason I give it 2 stars its because of the lovely waitress that was taking care of us.I thought that this place was going to be a good experience for me, but it was actually very disappointing.Maybe they can't handle stress very well.. The place was super full...But still at least a dissent burger...I don't know if they have a problem with people who ask the burger well-done, I know a lot of chefs don't like it, but I don't remember I've ever got such a bad burned burger ever in my life before. That was the last straw for me... One and a half hours... First and last time!"
3,We arrived Hamburg at noon and decide to get some burgers before going to the office. This place is pretty close to the city hall and rated well.I ordered the steak burger and fries and they both taste good. But the place is very hard to find since it's located in a food court in a shopping mall.
3,"Okay. I have an unnaturally positive opinion of Kumpir. They make potatoes with different toppings. This isn't rocket science. It is akin to Subway for potatoes.That being said, I love it. I love that it is open late, it is just out of the U/S-bahn station, and it is cheap. Did I mention that it is also tasty and the staff is always friendly? Let me say it now.I have run through most of the menu and it is pretty tasty. It seems like the people working there are generally happy to be alive, which I appreciate.The one thing limiting my review is the quality of some of the ingredients.  I could see an upgrade in quality bringing this to the next level, and a 5 star rating, as long as the price doesn't take an exponential hike.An extra euro here or there would be fine with better quality, but I will keep coming back anyway:)"
4,"Everytime i walk through the weidenallee i see L'incontro and say to myself, i should try that place out.and i finally have!when i got there around 7 pm, the place was already full, and we got one of the last 2 available tables. the place was full all through out the evening, with more than half of the tables 'reserved'. the food is really good.I highly advise you to try the gnocchi with 'maronen' ... its a delight. L'incontro is a cute little italian restaurant, its cozy, could be romantic if you are in the mood.I think reservation would be preferable although not required. All in all, the weidenallee is a nice change from schanze (and not too far away), if you are looking for something for the older crowd"
2,"All is said in Arril review. The surrounding is also great to walk with friends, play frisbee and enjoy movement of people and ships. I will always walk around when I have some time."
4,"Awesome, simply incredible food. Great atmosphere, great prices, four people, 2 starters, main dish dessert and lots of wine for 100 euro. Respect. We had the baked avocado with goat cheese and honey, luftgetrocknetes Rindfleisch ('carpaccio for People who don't like RAW meat')..Tortellini alla Panna - best ever. Tagliatelle with beef tips - best beef I have had in Hamburg, full stop. Pizza panna - those fenchelwurst! Awesome. Schweinemedallions in gorgonzola - rich creamy deliciousness. Just freaking go. Now."
3,Great place for German food close to everything in Hamburg.  We had two people get the pork shank for dinner and it was excellent (a little fatty). The beer was good and the prices were good. Great value for the money. I would definitely recommend if you are spending any time in Hamburg.
4,"After spotting in the newspaper last year that they were going to build Prototyp I was very happy to see it finally open.If your using public transport then Meßberg is your station. It's only a short 5 minute walk which is pretty good considering the HafenCity is a bit of a pain when it comes to public transport. The building is nicely set in a Speicherstadt style house. Just walking into the building is impressive. Suddenly switching from old to ultra modern! I must admit I felt like I just walked into an ultra stylish restaurant or clothes shop. Fantastic effect!!After paying the 7.50 Euro for the ticket (it's worth even if you only 'like' the look of cars). The staff were incredibly attentive I must admit. From being generally cheerful to giving helpful advice. Not sure if that's just a case of them still being in the opening phase or something.To the cars..A fantastic collection of various unique cars. Every car has in front of it a info box embedded in the floor. And what impressed me more than anything was a ~7 inch TFT display with a info video on loop (nice touch!).The first segment has a varied collection. But when you move deeper in then you get a lot of Porsche's. Not that I am complaining!Right at the back of the first floor is the simulator, a converted Porche 356 with a nicely sized flatscreen (tasteful enough sized). So you can drive a simulated track using the real steering wheel and gear shift. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to get on it as there were a lot of kids hogging (next time I will give it a go!).So after going round the first floor I finally find a Audio Room. Basically a 2m x 1m room with a touch screen display. Guessed what you can do in this room? Listen to the different sounds of different cars racing off. Fantastic I had a wonderful 10+ minutes of eardrum damaging fun!What else was on the first floor. The typical movie theatre affair with a HUGE screen. Although the video quality was not all that fantastic (they must have upscaled it).Downstairs is a temporary exhibition which was relatively basic but still fantastic. Some Formula 1 racing cars and very impressive Audi's.The one bit I totally missed out on was the art gallery. Next time I will have to take a look.So all in all Prototyp Hamburg is WELL worth a visit.So now done with the positive stuff. There were a few nigels I had with the place. The first being the touch screen computers. They were often very fiddly to use. For example in the Audio Room you had to double click on the volume control and make sure you helld your finger down to adjust the volume. Me being a techy it's no surprise right? :)The only other nigel is that the transition being floors is a little unclear. When you leave the first floor you feel like you have just left the exhibition. Then you walk downstairs and get surprised as there is another floor of cars.Conclusion  go visit it, as it's really worth it!"
4,My friend told me that this is his favourite steak house in Hamburg. And he will come to the restaurant every time when he is in Hamburg. I order the lamb and it is really good. It taste very juicy and tender.
4,Found the Bistro as I was walking around and I am so glad I stopped in as the service was fabulous!! I had the Hambourgeouise tartine and it was amazing!!!
3,"If you come to Hamburg on Sunday morning you will visit the Fischmarkt. You have to be there very early and after a walk and bargaining with different Fischmarkt-sellers, you will need a place to chill. If you follow the way from Fischmarkt to St. Pauli-Landungsbrücken, you pass Strand Pauli (that means Beach Pauli. And if it is summer and if the sun shines, you can sit on sofas or beachchairs or even lie on a queensize bed, drink Cocktails or have a breakfast, or snacks like Hamburger. The prices are a little bit higher than in a Pub - but when you see, that you have a beach in the harbour and can watch the ships passing by (as we saw the Sadov today) it is worth the money. We paid 10 Euros for 3 very well served non alcoholic drinks."
2,"Was there last thursday night and it was absolutely crowded. We managed to get a bar table, which wasn't one of the most comofortable seats since the chairs had no support to lean on. I had ratatouille filled baked potatoe gratinated in cheese and with creme fraiche. It was good, but not a stand out, but I wasn't disappointed. (They have better baked potatoes at other places in hamburg such as Kumpir in Sternschanze and for half the price too). All in all it was a nice evening. We got our food very quickly. Edit: I was there again last friday with 3 friends. I had the vegetarian flammenkuchen. They used mushrooms from a can. I hate when restaurants don't use fresh mushrooms. Again, the restaurant was crowded, but neither food or service was more than average, so I lower it to 3 stars. We went to 15 restaurants and bars in hamburg iover the weekend and this was the worst of them. However it doesn't really say much since the rest of them were excellent."
4,"Had the Homemade dumplings--Maultashen, spatzle soup,caraway bread and a chocolate brownie w vanilla ice cream. High quality outstanding meal in a small unassuming setting. Everything homemade.  An outstanding meal."
4,Was very impressed with this stylish and cool restaurant which used to be an old warehouse. It is very different to any restaurant I've been to. The food was also very tasty and the staff were very pleasant.
4,The Strandperle is for lots of people living in Hamburg a kind of a famous café. They are right. It is really beautiful.It is directly situated at the Elbe and visitors have really a great view at this river. You may watch the huge ships passing by while you are having a coffee or you are enjoying your breakfast.A small beach is directly in front of the caféThe café is very special and you will find lots of young people spending their time here. Lots of people in the twenties and thirties go there to meet friends or to relax.The atmosphere is amazing. When you go there simply to have coffee and to relax it often may happen that people start a conversation without knowing you at all. This is the result of such a comfortable atmosphere. Everybody is relaxed and life is beautiful again.The service is very friendly and professional.It is really worth going there and enjoy this place.
2,Good service. This place is well located and not over prices despite being across road from train station. Wasn't crazy for the pilsner beer I had but good selection. Food looks good from what I saw on other tables. Not a bad stop off but you feel like moving on from here eventually...
4,"I shared the massive meat platter and salad. Delicious food, nice beer, good price, and great atmosphere. It DOES manage to do the whole semi-bar, semi-kebab shop really well, and is a great way to start off the night. A niche but very important role. The staff were really friendly too and the food and beers arrived quick. For the quality of quantity of food you get, the price is great."
4,"Delicious German food our beautifully rustic atmosphere. We had the Rinderroulade and Pannfisch, which both were delicious.The staff is super friendly and helpful. Added with a bit of luck you also get to meet the house's dog."
3,"Cool bar in between St. Pauli and the Schanze. They sell Pilsner Urquell pretty cheap and have a cool open mic night, which is what I was there for. The only drawback with this place is that it's a little bit isolated."
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90.Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel.Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
4,A great place for a peaceful walk away from the main roads. There is also a dear sanctuary in the park. Ideal place also for running or walking the dog.
4,"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Hamburg. Cafe Mexico has dishes I haven't found at any other Mexican restaurant in the area - chilaquiles, tamales, nopales, you name it. Its obvious the kitchen staff are using high-quality ingredients and making everything from scratch. The drinks menu is extensive and the margaritas are small and potent. I went with a large party of friends last year and the waiter gave us all a free shot of tequila at the end of the meal. Service was great - the waiter took the time to explain different dishes to us and slipped in and out of German, English and Spanish depending on who he was talking to in our group."
4,"Eiskantine, I am going to need new jeans soon because of you if I keep coming here so frequently.I have come here way too often in the last 2 months and every time is even better than the last. All of the flavours are absolutely delicious. An always changing collection of unique ice creams and sorbets."
4,"I believe this is one of the most beautiful views of Hamburg Hafen from a bar.  You really capture the beauty of not only the Harbor city but can see down the Elbe River for quite some distance. The entire Empire Hotel is chic, and the food is tasty and served with a bit of poshness as most trendy hotels usually incorporate into the overall experience.  The worst thing to discover with going to Lounge 20 Up is when a queue (or long line) develops to head upstairs to the bar area.  Either stand in line or enjoy a few cocktails at the hotel lobby level bar until the line dies down, then head upstairs.  The risk you run of not standing in the roped off line is that when you finally get upstairs, you might NOT easily find anywhere to sit, let alone stand on busier nights.   When it is crowded, you have little to no chance of actually getting close enough to the window to enjoy a city view, but if you finally manage to steal a table with a a view, the sight is gorgeous.. Floor to ceiling glass walls almost make you feel like you will fall.  If you are afraid of heights, your stomach gets a couple butterflies but you get over it pretty quick. Any tourist to Hamburg should come here just for the FREE view of the Harbor alone. What is not free, are the pricey cocktails!  I like to order the champagne mixed cocktails by the glass served in a flute, often with a gooseberry fruit garnish. Do not expect to dance here, it is mainly for cocktails and lounging, but since it is only a 10 minute walk to Reeperbahn, you can be at clubs, bars, other touristy attractions in no time.  It receives 5 Stars for the views of 20Up and the upscale trendy vibe of the hotel facilities and decor. Tip: There is a coat check but on busy nights, this is one of those establishments that frown a bit if you do not check your coat in and request to hold onto it.  You get a quick glance like, ""Oh, you want to hold onto your own jacket/coat?!"""
4,"An excellent Indian cafe a short walk from the Hauptbahnhof. Don't expect nice table cloths and stylish service but the food is great. Also, check out their Indian sweets with a sugar content so high it should be illegal. It's strange that some if the best Asian cuisine is served in little cafés like this."
4,"Amazing place, details are unbelievable. What amount of work for completing it."
4,"Best Indian food I've had in Hamburg thus far. Went here on an impulse with coworkers for lunch. Little hole in the wall place with amazing food at incredibly low prices. We shared an appetizer of veggie samosas. Love the way it was plated with a variety of dips at all degrees of heat from none to more than some. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Thali, it contained a moderate hint of heat which was enjoyable. My dish came with chicken, rice, yoghurt, a mini salad, bean/legume side, and naan. It was hard to believe all this was just €5.50. After seeing my coworker's plate of Chili Chicken Thali, I think I will have to try that next time to test just how spicy it might be."
4,I love self-service Bok - I prefer the no messing around feeling. I prefer the way the food is presented. I prefer looking at a few boards rather than that ridiculous 500 page book of a menu - it's so much easier to find something you want to eat. I also prefer the Wagamama-esque benches and communal tables - it lends itself to a much friendlier atmosphere. There's also no getting annoyed that you can't get the over-worked waiter's attention. The only real negative with this place is that it's situated underneath a Burger King. Oh well.
4,"Yum!One of the better values since I've been in Hamburg. I got the Schweinebraten (roast pork. DAT SKIN DOE.), mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut. You can either get a small or large portion, though there wasn't too big of a difference between the two. The small seems to be good enough. They spoke English here. :)DAS GOOT."
4,"Amazing Breton style buckwheat crepes. I had the Nordique, which comes with smoked salmon and sour cream. The atmosphere was pleasant and nautical and my table shared a bottle of the house white wine which went perfectly with the meal. Ask for an English menu, there is one available."
4,"This place is an oasis of human interaction and peace. I really loved it! It was one of the most or I could say most heartwarming experiences visiting a place can offer. You get to know not only how it is - to see nothing and spend time in dark - but whats more important is that you learn to trust the person guiding you, not even seeing them. Just buy touch. When it ended I wished that peace and trust could last longer. Have to apply well in advance to get a tour, but it is so worth it. Also don't forget to put a few Euros in pocket(have to leave stuff in locker) to get to buy some drink, I had chocolate milk, and it tasted amazing! Great experience, would go again!"
3,"Don't know why Oma decided to name this place Apotheke, when it is in fact a bar / restaurant, but however bad his marketing skills are there is no doubt he cook some banging food. I played it safe with a tasty French Onion soup inside a bowl made of bread (only ever seen this done previously in Austria), which was gorgeous and more than enough for a meal in its own right. Bargain for the 5EUR it cost me. My fellow dinner guests followed suit, except for one brave soul who plumped for the cheeseburger, which was so big it could have given Chunk (thebestsportsblog.com/im…) a run for his money."
1,"Had dinner here with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. Tasted good, but messed up our plumbing. Won't be coming here anymore! Unless you're ok with a tummy ache after. Good luck!"
3,"Quite a cool place. Very big and bright. Pay around 25 euros (if i remember remember correctly) for an all you can eat buffet with mostly japanese and Chinese food (such as sushi, noodles, duck etc.). Also a section with raw food (meat, fish and veg) for the cooks to cook up in front of you.Generally the food is decent. Gets refreshed every so often and the deserts are different everytime i go there but always tasty (fried banana, cake, fruit plate).Sometimes service is slow, but they do come and refill your empty glass. Cocktail bar in there as well with a separate lounge area. Whiskey sours was good."
3,"Stopped off for brunch on Saturday. My wife and I showed up around noon and found only a few seats available. Reservations seem really popular for breakfast here; I would definitely call ahead! Brunch runs from 8AM - 2PM and focuses on the classics: meat, cheese, eggs, eggs with bacon bits, OJ, and salad. I think it was just the right amount of food and selection for 8 Euro.Drinks, coffee and alcohol are available at the front counter. Everything seems to be self serve and pay afterwards. It's a pretty chill atmosphere, maybe a bit loud though when all the rooms are full. I'll probably be heading back."
3,"Authentic Korean food. The service is just okay due to their overcrowded client volume. The food is nice. I'll recommend roast meat menu and their ""hot pot"" menu (it's actually kind of bigger version of soup). I have to say it is a bit pricy compared to the quality of food."
4,"YAY- After being to this bar countless times now already with friends or just on my own and constantly raving about how much i enjoy this place I finally decided today that along with my Latte Macchiato I'd ask the name of the bar as for the longest time now have been calling it Sofabar for obvious reasons. With a salon lounge filled with pre-loved sofas, some definitely from another era... this is undoubtedly Hamburgs most comfortable bar. This place is always at least half full even during the day and on some nights you may even have to wait to score a couch of your own, but with over twenty sofas to sink into and table service, this is an ideal place to come chillout, listen to some tunes, sit back and have drinks with friends. Not only is this a great bar with reasonably priced beers and drinks.... the coffee is worth coming for too! The great all rounder..."
4,Lovely place for coffee or sandwich. Unpretentios and affordable inspite of location. Big enough to accomodate large groups. Wonderful service. First floor terrace overlooking Binenalster channel makes it even more attractive. What else to wish?
4,"This really is an exceptional bar.  It is neighborhoody, unpretentious, but every aspect is just a step above.  The beer selection is fine (in an old-school, non-craft-beer-aficianado sense).  The outdoor seats let you settle back and reflect, and the indoor spots are pleasantly nooky.  The servers are keen, able, and cool.   A great place to hang."
3,"Serves food til midnight every day of the week, including Sunday. Centrally located. Ordered 4 Dim Sum plates, two bowls of Hot and Sour soup and one plate of Chinese vegetables. My boyfriend had a beer. All for about 33 euros. Service was fast, friendly and the food came out quickly. The Dim Sum plates were fine. We got the steamed puns with pork, the pork and shrimp dlsteamed dumpling, fish balls and fried tofu. The only dish that was really great was the tofu. I wouldn't recommend the fish balls.The best part of the meal was the soup and the vegetables, but mostly the soup. It was a large portion and was the best version of Hot and Sour I've ever had. It's impressive when a place makes a classic exciting like that. And only for 2.60 euros a bowl. I'll be coming back here for a late night soup for sure."
2,"Came here because it was close to my hotel and lookd like a popular place.  It was good but doesn't beat Red Robin IMO.  Anyway, I was looking around and noticed something odd, from an american stand point.  This is what I learned.  Germans eat their burgers with a fork and knife."
3,"Like usual, super Burger and tasty Cocktails.Insiders will always go the roof, great Lounge feelingand super View to the Elbe River.(Good Weather Only)Side Area of the Roof is Rain- and Wind protected.Don't miss it for a Tour through Hamburg."
4,"Great spot for Polish food! My friend recommended this place as he said this is like his comfort food. I can see what he means as the food is very hearty and reminds you of home cooked meals immediately! A couple of friends and I met up for dinner and drinks on a Sunday night here. I hear that this place can be very crowded so it is best to call ahead and reserve if you can. We we got there though, there was plenty of room, but they did indicate which tables were reserved and at what times. For my drink, I ordered the Parliament mule which consisted of vodka, ginger, and I think bitter orange? It was very tasty and refreshing. Reminded me of a mimosa but with a vodka kick!For our appetizer, we shared a plate of pickled vegetables and we also nibbled on fresh bread and dip (on the house!). The pickled vegetables assortment was pretty interesting. There were not just cucumbers in the mix but also little squash veggies and tomatoes as well. It was a great start to the meal. My friend mentioned that you usually start with the pickled vegetables and shots of vodka. I think that sounds better so I might try that next time! :)For my entree, I ordered the mixed plate of pierogis. It comes with 8 pirerogis (mix of vegetable and meat ones) and some sour cream sauce for dipping. I was a little bit scared 8 pieces would not be enough but the pieces are packed with vegetable and meat fillings so yeah in the end... I was happy and full!It's a great spot for dinner and drinks as they have their own spin on cocktails and the classic choices for your beers. The food is all really great and reasonably priced! I need to come back to try the borsch! :)"
3,"On our first night in Hamburg after making the big move from SF, we had our celebratory dinner here. Badshah wasn't hard to find though the signage might not be super obvious when it's dark. The restaurant is pretty small, but tables seem to turn quite fast. We each ordered the Thali plate, mine with the chicken tikka masala and his with the palak paneer. Both were very tasty. I ordered the mango lassi as well and it was probably one of the better mango lassis I've had. Service was quick, the staff was friendly and price point was decent. Overall, very on par with anything we'd get in San Francisco, which is great!"
1,"Mutter, a bar I have never managed to get into. No, not because of their door policy, but because all of the smokers of Hamburg and the rest of the world now congregate here and chainsmoke like beagles in a Huntingdon life sciences lab. Not I'm not one to whinge about passive smoking, far from it. But when the only way to survive in a bar is to don scuba gear well, it's over for me. I can't swim anyway."
4,"This is the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Hamburg I know - they didn't even used to have a menu; rather, those 'in the know' would just order one of five house menu items, like the pho or bun of the day.  Now they've modernized with a one-page menu with pictures, perfect for the old and new fans alike! Very affordable, good home cooking.  Difficult to get a table after noon on the weekends, but it's worth coming early for!"
4,"WOW!! What a marvellous place...little India.Simple, easy and unconventional but really great. The food is excellent.I had the most basic food...chicken tikka masala. Indian spicy. And it was very spicy! Just perfect.It's a place for great food and less candle light atmosphere.To sum up: Come around and enjoy!"
3,"This is a great place in Hamburg to sit and eat with friends. It's pretty packed, but if you hang around it long enough, you can get a place to sit.  I'd say this place is more north Vietnamese than southern, which means the dishes are presented and named differently, but it's so slight most people won't even notice/care. The pho here is different than most other Vietnamese restaurants: you don't get a side dish of bean sprouts, lime, chilis and herbs to add to you soup.This isn't a downside in my opinion, because the soup gets there fast and is beautifully satisfying.Since all the pho is 6.50 (a freaking steal if you ask me), I got pho tôm, which was pretty damn good. My friends all had Bún (pork, beef & tofu). I tried the tofu bún and it was truly amazing. I will probably get it the next time I'm here. The drinks were all good, both the lemonades and the red sake mojito are freshly made.All in all (tl;dr), it's a nice casual place to go and sit with friends and eat, drink & talk. I'm sure it's even nicer in the summer months with outdoor seating and slower tempo. The only downside was the waitress, she was a bit curt and heavy-handed, but I'm sure she'd had a long day. In the end we didn't mind it because the food was good and the service was fast."
2,"This used to be a five star place. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have taken a dive. Service is fast and it's so busy you have to fight for a seat. This hasn't changed. These are the reasons I'm disappointed: 1.) My favorite items, the salad and the sandwhich with thinly sliced filet has been discontinued. Only variations of burger patty are available now. 2.) They ran out of carbonation for their fountain drinks. They offered a bottle of Fritz Cola instead, but didn't have any in diet. 3.) I ordered a salad with balsamic vinegar and got one with French dressing. 4.) They remade my salad and it tasted like both balsamic and French dressing combined. Was the mixing bowl clean? 5.) It used to be that their salads used the finer parts of the leaves. My salad tonight consisted of at least 50% white parts, the tough and tasteless sections of the lettuce leaf near the stem. I ended up eating less than half of my salad. Even my husband who happily gobbles up my plate and his took just a few bites and gave up. Honestly, with the filet strips no longer on the menu, I have no reason to return to this Jim Block or any other Jim Block."
2,"From the very beginning, they had us standing out in the cold so they could try to sell pictures of us with axes. Considering the price we shoulda gotten the picture for free... lol It's a lot of acting and narrating in German, so if you don't speak german, a lot goes over your head. But some of the videos have english on the bottom however bring your reading glasses cuz its a bit small. overall i think they should consider english tours considering they have parts of their brochure in english... a lil misleading. so 3 stars only."
2,"Schöne Location und auch nette Mitarbeiter. Die Preise allerdings sind frech - viel zu teuer, für das, was man bekommt, gerade im Bereich der Kuchen und Torten."
0,"Sadly, this place is a poor representative of Hamburg and the German people.  We came here with our daughter and her boyfriend, who is studying in Hamburg,  and they would not serve us.  They told they did not have space, which is fine. (Even though it appeared several tables open).  When we asked how long of a wait for a table, she said,"" we don't have any space for you.""  All four of us, including our daughter's german speaking boyfriend, agreed the message was rude and because we were Americans.  Warning- if you are an American visiting Hamburg, don't come here.   What I would like to tell the server who was so rude. Please come to Southern California in the USA and enjoy our beautiful beaches. We promise to treat you better than you chose to treat us."
3,"I wouldn't normally go to a restaurant this close to the Reeperbahn, but a colleague assured me that this place was worth it, and boy was he right! I can't remember the exact name of the dish, but it was pasta with meatballs or perhaps sausage meat and it was amazing. Probably the best pasta I've had in Hamburg. The location is a bit odd (you have to dodge the local prostitutes to get there), but once inside it's nicely decorated and they even have a small outdoor area out the back for those warm summertime evenings. The food is a bit more pricey than most Italian restaurants in Hamburg. A pasta dish will set you back about EUR10 and a meat or fish dish will be more like EUR20. Overall: great food, odd location."
3,"Südhang has a really great, warm friendly atmosphere. I was there on a Monday evening after a day of mooching around Hamburg and wanted a nice glass of wine to finish the day. I got to test first which is great. The staff were all really friendly and welcoming. Would defiantly go again. I think it's a great first date location, nice lighting, mellow and calm atmosphere."
4,"The most Irish Irish pub that I've been to in Hamburg. They pride themselves on the quality of their Guinness, the breadth of their whiskey collection and the standard of their food. I told them I found them on the internet as the top Irish pub in Hamburg, they countered with we're the top Irish pub in Germany! and pointed to a wall of awards. When we approached the bar we were offered two Guinness, almost as if that was the only option. I asked about the other beer available and then decided that it was either Kilkenny or Guinness. I went for Guinness. Next up, choosing some food. Near the front of the menu was Fish and Chips. I love a good fish and chips, but I've not had any since coming to live in Germany (1 year ago). I asked how it was, more meaning what type of fish and chips it was (chippy or restaurant), and was told that it's very good. I was then told that they were so confident in it that If you don't like it, you can have it for free. The Guinness was good. The fish was beautiful. As with all Irish pubs, the prices aren't cheap. A 400ml Guinness is EUR3.70 and the Fish and Chips was EUR10. I'll be back."
4,Delicious I didn't know kebabs could be this good!
0,Great wings. But worst service ever!!! Takes ages to get your food if and just if they do't forget it!
3,"3 Euro for a falafel brot (which is actually a wrap). It is hot, tasty, but not the best i had. In Berlin one can find much better falafel joints. This place is an amazing solution for hunger after midnight when most place are closing down. I was afraid a vegan like me would not find  anything at this time, but found this as a great option. The place was full, and there is a cozy sit down tables on a gallery upstairs."
4,"A good place for burrito lovers and ""alternative"" people.I'm vegetarian and burritos are one of my favourite foods, so when I found this place I was excited to see their menu is conveniently divided into meat/vegetarian/vegan selections - with more than enough choices in each category.The burritos are big and juicy, the kind you have to eat with a fork and knife, and are some of the best I've ever had. When it's busy you might find yourself waiting quite a long time for your food, but the atmosphere is nice and they specifically say that on their menu so there's no surprise. All in all, one of my favourite places to eat in Hamburg so far."
4,"This museum is super interesting and was worth every minute of our visit. The guides were super polite and helpful. Our visit consisted of putting yourself in a blind person's shoes; we navigated through a dark room and did everyday activities. To make the visit more lifelike, the guides were seeing-impaired so they have expertise and knowledge for the activity. Everyone was polite, friendly, and had an amazing attitude. I recommend this place for everybody that comes to Hamburg and is looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
3,"Hubby took me here for my birthday. Our reservation had requested a seat by the window so we can enjoy the view but we were seated at a table next to a table by the window; we asked if we could take the empty one by the window but were told the table was reserved. It actually remained empty the whole time we were there, so that was a disappointment.We ordered the Chateaubriand for two which comes with a total of four sides and two sauces, so we got the asparagus, broccoli, roasted veggies and truffle fries. As you can see we tried to even out the meat with all the veggies. For the sauce we got the truffle and lobster - both were rich and full of flavor, but we both liked the truffle one best. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and was flavorful and tender. The sort-of table side service (since the steak is cut in the dining room but at a special station vs next to your table) made it seem quite fancy. For dessert we got the coconut sorbet sans ""Happy Birthday"" message despite hubby making the request with our reservation. Except for the restaurant seemingly not reading the special request in our reservation, this was a nice indulgent night out. The food was good and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, and the view is hard to beat."
2,"Sorry fellas, but it's NOT like being on the real beach: so damn packed you can't even strech your legs and the view is non-existent due to the monstrous Blohm&Voss shipyard with all the noise from welding and construction (is it another yacht of Abramovich?) Well, actually it's not that bad, better than infierno of the cement and glass in the city on a hot summer day. They have cocktails, they have beer, they have sand - but that's about it."
4,"Excellente. Had a superb porcini mushroom (Steinpilz) tortellini in a light cream sauce, washed down with a lovely glass of pinot grigio. I rarely order vegetarian meals but this was excellent and one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The restaurant is modern and stylish. The service is friendly and very professional. I was there midweek and didn't need to book a table but I'm sure weekends are very busy. I'd love to go back when have a bigger appetite and have several courses."
2,"Update: Last time I was here the service was rude and so slow that we had to threaten to leave before we finally got given our tapas. My old score was 5/5. ================== This place is excellent. Best tapas I've had in Hamburg, and I've previously had some pretty good tapas. More food than we could eat + beers for five guys and the bill only came to EUR47(!) Things to definitely order:-the spicy potatoes (10 or 12 on the menu, I forget)-the chorizo (it comes flaming!)-the honey-mustard chicken-the fried cheese & ham thingys (I will learn the name) I'll definitely be back."
4,"Really good dürum- I Stan this bitch. It was juicy, dry everything u would want in a durum."
4,"Golden is certainly one of my top favourite chinese restaurants in Europe. Instead of choosing from the German menu, I recommend to talk to the owner-manager, a smiling chubby 50 year-old chinese who speaks English and is very friendly and helpful. If there's too many people to get a hold of him, choose dishes on the menu starting from number 700 and above. Those are the authentic ones. All previous ones are for foreigners. I beg you not to drink soft drinks with this food, order jasmin tea for heaven's sake! They actually serve an excellent one, a rare thing these days and a distinct sign of quality."
4,"Found this restaurant through Yelp. The reviews convinced us to try it and  I'm glad we did.  This very small (24-30) seat restaurant serves authentic German cuisine.  The menu was hand written in German so my wife and I couldn't read a thing.  The waiter, who spoke limited English, slowly interpreted everything on the menu for us.I had wild boar, cooked osso buco style. Served with a creamy risotto.  It was outstanding.  My wife had Weiner Schnitzel which was excellent. We had oysters and calamari for apps. 2 glasses of regional wines.  Bill was €72.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant"
3,"Spacious cafe & roastery in the same development as the Ratsherrn brewery, which seems to be well placed for getting the sun throughout the day.Service was good & the coffees and cake were equally good and well sized. Someone more discerning with their coffee drinking than me could no doubt delineate between good or bad but I'm more concerned with size & temperature of the drink when it reaches me and both were up to scratch."
4,"I didn't have really high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised! We arrived at 2pm on a Friday afternoon in April. They said we would need to wait 45 minutes, as they let people in on a co trolled basis to avoid overcrowding. We didnt mind waiting at all, since it gave us a chance to rest anyway. The exhibits are absolutely mind blowing in terms of the attention to detail. You can also see the artists at work, as they allow you to watch the creation of new displays.  You will get the sense of how painstaking it is to create all the displays that they did. We enjoyed the Italy displays the most. We felt the US displays were put together a bit too randomly.   For example, you have a backdrop of a tornado, against a space shuttle launch, situated next to Las Vegas and Miami beach. The US displays were also a bit sterotypical, which included a ""gold rush"" scene that didn't seem synced up. Lots of fun though. The displays include working trains, lights, transitions from day to night, etc. Plan to spend at least 2 hours there."
4,"So good food and such a good service ! It is a little bit more expensive than other restaurants in Hamburg but so worth it. You get what you pay for! You can choose from different side dishes, sauces and herb butters and combine your own meal. The waiter we had was very nice! He filled up our glasses in time and even tho the restaurant was packed with people we didn't have to wait for a long time for the food. The tartare starers is to die for!"
3,"Pretty cool concept. Bunch of couches laying around (well, aligned perfectly, actually - It's Germany after all), a few vintage lamps lighting the place and a small bar at the end. Sat down late at night, had a few ciders and a nice convo. This one's called Zöe #2 because the lounge across the street called Zöe #1 and belongs to the same people. They look the same but we chose this one because #2 didn't serve tea (true story). Anyway, chill place to chill, A+"
3,It's close to the wonderland. After visiting that I just searched restaurant and choose ti breizh. It's cheaper and more delicious than i imagine. But the passion juice is too sweet.，
4,"Nice informal atmosphere, simple but cracking menu, country potatoes are the absolute best in Hamburg."
4,"I like this place! Friendly people, associates and their coffee is great, salads tasteful and their bagels are 100% OK. Worth a visit and enjoy it!"
4,"Unbelievable what you get to see here. Make sure you'll register online to get a reservation, this place gets very busy at times.Breathtaking Details that you can only see if you take your Time.Thousands of little Cars driving around, a few hundred Locomotives (the longest Train is what, 50 feet long?) and Mountains, Cities, Bridges built with a passion for detail.The Command Center (40+ computers) looks like the NASA Control Center.Google ""Miniatur Welt Hamburg"" and see the You-Tube Video.The new Airport simply rocks, a must see!I'll be back on my next Visit to Germany!"
3,"As long as I'm sitting outside, on some sort of bench and preferably my thigh is touching someone attractiveI'm usually quite content. But, if the bar I'm doing it at also has a nice crowd and my beer is extra largeI'm quite contenter. There is a cat theme only shown by the little cats painted on the floors and a couple other places, but the kicker is the massive gun motif at the end of the stairs before the bathroom? It draws a big Huh? when passing, but after a couple Augustiners, it's novel. Great view of the whole area, including the squat whose rustic smell will hit you if you're there on a good day when the wind has picked up. Yum!"
3,"If you see the locals eating here, you know that it's gotta be good...but it was soooooo good. This place was bustling nearly 24/7 for a reason. We passed this place several times of day over the two days we were in town as we were staying nearby and every time the tables were filled...12PM, 6PM or 2AM...this place was putting down excellent food. We came here for some late night goodies after a night out and then more importantly for dinner one evening and I was thoroughly impressed. The ezme and homemade pita bread (more of a cross between pizza crush and naan) as a starter on the table was TOO DIE FOR! Such a great first impression. Then the rest of the food that followed was just a pile of flavor explosions! The meats are incredibly well season and prepared. The vegetables are fresh and all the sauces are lick the platter clean good. Highly recommend this as a stop while you're in Hamburg...at ANY time of day. Only complaint...the place was HOT! Really warm and wish they would use the A/C a little more liberally."
3,"After an aborted attempt to visit another restaurant on our first evening in Hamburg we found this delightful little pub. Tucked in a pretty, quieter part of Hamburg near the Hummel statue, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the servers (not all spoke English, but were more than happy to get their coworkers who did, and English menus were available) were friendly and even attentive - not terribly common in Germany! You don't have only one server - the whole team is ready to help you. We were excited to try a craft Pils rather than something from the big breweries, so we ordered a few glasses. After a few inquiries we made our selections from the menu. I wanted to try a dish more local to Hamburg and our server helpfully pointed them out to me - all different herring dishes. I asked which she would recommend and she very helpfully told me that the Eingelegte Bratheringe (a fried herring dish) had started marinating that day, so it wouldn't really taste the way it should until it had marinated overnight and therefore suggested the Heringstopf - a dish with marinated herring fillets in a housemade cream with onions and apples. It came with Bratkartoffeln (fried potatoes) and salad. It was delicious but extremely rich. I couldn't finish it because we had ordered an appetizer (a very tasty goose terrine). The boy had pork schnitzel which came with a nice cucumber and cream salad that we didn't have in any other parts of Germany. Bottom line: The meal was reasonably priced, the service was friendly and efficient, there were Hamburg specialties on the menu, the ambiance was great, the area was pretty and the beer selection was good. Wholeheartedly recommend it."
4,"I already passed this bar many times on my way to the schanze. Never went in because of the tight packed crowd.Until last friday, I arrived early, lucky to find seats on the bar! Perfect setting, when you feel like drinking!Around 10oclock it was getting more crowded, which only improved the chill, social atmosphere.A goodlooking dj played funky background sounds, although, unfortunately, this is not the place to dance your night away...Perfect for starting off though!The caiprinhias were amazing, so was the service (only woman...?!), and after some tequilla gold shots I was feeling like I wasnt able to leave this place ever again! Or else...come back for sure! Prices are reasonable, luckily! Another reason I should go back...There was supposed to be an aquarium in the middle of the room (cool!!), I did had some thoughts..but yeah, to be sure, definitely have to come back to have a closer look!"
4,"Very friendly staff, delicious food and not too pricy. They brought out olives, bread, and drinks as soon as we got seated and tolerated my terrible German. I've been there three times and I still have yet to try something on the menu that I wasn't very pleased with. Be careful around the bathroom area though, there is a sneaky hidden step and once I missed it and fell. Thankfully no one saw. But I would hate for anyone else to have the same experience."
3,"This is a new breakfast favorite. Have been coming here for some time and never wrote a review. We like sitting outside on the upstairs balcony. Great people watching as well as a great breakfast. When it's too cold we prefer sitting at the bar upstairs and eating there. The service is super nice and breakfast is pretty varied and always tasty. One argument I have is that the place tends to be a bit smoke filled if too many smokers are around. Somehow the place doesn't air out well and if there are a bunch of smoker around, we turn around and head elsewhere. Otherwise, a great place that's very central and comfortable. Great place to hit for breakfast followed by shopping in town. If you come, make sure to sit upstairs....downstairs is kinda boring and if it's nice outside, you can sit out front or upstairs on the balcony. Don't forget though that the balcony fills up real quick. They also have heating towers outside and blankets so even on colder days, the outdoor option is one to consider."
2,"If you need to satisfy your greasy Chinese food cravings this is def the place to come to. Over priced Chinese food with an ambiance that makes you feel like you in the movie rush hour. The food is just ok, fairly fresh. Unfortunately I ordered from the English menu which didn't really explain the dishes very well so ask your server to clarify!"
3,"Trendy, cozy, chilled. Several standard drinks served on a high quality level make your night at this place. Enjoy yourself and your crew in between well off people of any age. The music is easy to listen and even if the place is crowded it is quite easy to keep talking and even more important listening ;-) The bartenders are really pros and they give you the drinks in a good mood and in a very reasonable time. You are looking for a place for a easy evening? Then this is the place you should truly consider.One star is missing because service time is reasonable, not best effort at any time."
4,"Trüffelschwein is a restaurant that is well deserving of its Michelin star (I personally would give it two), and we have now been feeling extra lucky to know how close we live to it and how amazing food-art is just a stone's ""throw away,"" as long as their is plenty of ""disposable"" income lying around. ;o)In all seriousness, a meal here is without question worth the price tag and was certainly one of the best fine dining meals we've had. It is also definitely a place worthy of milestone celebrations so it was the perfect spot to celebrate my wife's birthday. There were a number of options for the amount of courses to partake in, five to be exact, and we opted for the 7 course degustation which really came out to 11 courses after the amazing amuse bouche and dessert extras.1st beef tartare-cucumber-gin: tasty and very well balanced, also came with two pieces of steak to grill on a tiny personal grill.2nd prawn-pork belly-couscous-saffron: excellently prepared prawn over fork-tender pork belly and savory fine couscous, it was one of my favorites.3rd stuffed cabbage-truffle-truffle jus: this dish was completely covered in decadent truffle shavings. 4th pineapple vanilla sorbet-champagne: excellent palate cleanser before the main.  5th iberico pork-truffle-celery-almonds: our main course had so many different delicious elements to it, my wife called it ""a journey on a plate""...apt.6th aperol spritz to eat: amazing frozen aperol with a lot of sweet and delectable surprises in it like fruit and candied things.7th frozen goat cheese-tarragon-white chocolate-olive oil: sensational dessert that was almost too pretty to eat and despite many of the savory elements, it was still quite sweet and was easily one of my most favorite desserts ever. 8th birthday cake!One thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the fact that we weren't really sure how everything was going to taste ahead of time. There were a lot of new flavor combinations and surprises for our palates which I really enjoyed.Overall, the food was excellent and beautifully and artfully plated. Service was fantastic. We both really enjoyed our entire dining experience and hopefully won't be waiting as long as we did to dine here again."
4,"Excellent food, very special action. This is a unique experience! Never had a better experience in a fish restaurant!After a few days here is a little more detailed review:We arrived at Casa Franco and got an ""dude"" welcome. We were placed in the middle of the restaurant and it seemed uncomfortable at the beginning. My wife and me got seated at a 6 seater with just one couple with us. The tender told us, that he is the menu tonite, so we don't need to read. Decision was easy: he asked us if we want fish, meat or vegetarian. We decided to go with the fish menu. As start we got olives with tasty bread and kind of mayonnaise-garlic sauce. After a while the flambed scampi arrived and that was a big start!! The second course was a super tasty mix of tuna and pike-perch fish. This was the time we realized that everybody in the room took the fish menu - and they started to serve the courses simultaneously. After the second course they served a shot for everybody with general salut! After a while one of the tenders showed up with the next course - in raw format. It was a loach and a kind of a big fish! Meanwhile a guitar singer walked through the room and gave us a big Portuguese feeling with singing pretty good and impulsive!The third course arrived and that was a big one! The Loach of course and a super tasty sword-fish we're served with tasty vegetable. Each fish got his own sauce (as with every course) and it was great! The dessert was good and after that another shot arrived. Each course and shot was announced once to the entire audience.With all that, we experienced a great dinner with a feeling of being big friends to guest at friends! While leaving every women got a rose as gift and after talking to the manager and thanking big for the great dinner, he passed a bottle of Rioja to me.Thank you ""Casa Franco"" team for this unique experience! We will definitely come back!Addendum: when arriving you might think ""WTF"" but don't judge on this - this one is one of the best fish restaurants I've ever bin."
4,"Great steak place, in my mind comparable to Outback Steakhouse, if not better.  A chain, but great quality none the less.  If you're looking for a good American style steak in Germany, this is the place!  Their homemade sour cream tastes incredible, also.  Dog and kid friendly."
4,"After a short wait to get a table, the breakfast was simply sensational. The coffee was good, orange juice was fresh, and the granola was delicious. I then had the avocado and eggs in toast with Pesto - delicious. Would definitely come back here."
4,"Bock Treffpunkt Imbiss has been described to be as ""the place where vegetarians eat meat, where non-smokers smoke and where atheists come to pray.""It's that good. I ordered the köttbullar and the dish managed to exceed my already high expectations. I thought the sauteed mushrooms in the sauce was a nice touch as well. It really brought together all of the flavours. Post meal, we were offered a choice of dessert. I went with the chocolate pudding and custard. This was hands down the best köttbullar that I've had in Hamburg, yet.It's quite the interesting little setup as well -- underneath a tent. Very cozy and not the least bit cold in Winter as it is heated."
3,"In a one week business trip to Hamburg, I ate green lovers four times: once with a coworker, once as catering for a team meeting, and twice on my own. So I guess you could say I'm a fan of this place! And I'm clearly not the only fan, as there was a lunch line every time I visited (various times between noon and 1:30). But not to worry, the line moves quite fast and you'll be eating lunch before you know it.There are various salad and soup options available, or you can create a custom salad by pointing at ingredients at the counter. I quickly learned how to say the various parts of my order in German (mixed salad, egg, beans, corn, mushrooms, tomato, parmesan cheese, balsamic dressing), though most of the staff is pretty fluent in English. Visiting from SF where a custom lunch salad can easily cost $14, the prices here (around 5-8 euros for a custom salad, depending on what you put in it) seem very reasonable.There's some indoor seating but it's pretty packed at lunch, so you may want to plan to take your meal elsewhere. Though if you do manage to get a seat and are dining alone, not to worry, they have free wi-fi!Healthy, fresh, fast, and reasonably priced, this is a great antidote to the heaviness and grease typically associated with German food."
3,"I went there based on the numerous positive suggestions. It is in the basement of the building on a pretty little street. I had called in with a reservation request and they promised me that a table would be open. But once I got there, still had to wait 10 minutes to sit down, which was a bit of a bummer. I ordered a Salmon, Spinach and Tomato savory crepe. It took a while to get but it was very delish. The salmon was a bit salty but very flavorful. I went for a sweet crepe (sugar and lime) and that was even better than the savory option.My recommendation is for you to stick to the sweet options if you decide to check it out. They are far superior and just as good as the ones you get on the streets of the City of Lights."
3,"Three things here are unquestionably cool. The name: A day bar, which is called ""first love"", cannot be completely bad. Then the free view through the enormous windowpanes. And (last but not least) the WLAN (uncool: it's npt free). What else? The usual menu card with pasta & snacks as well as the obligatory selection on coffee from latte to espresso and various cakes (home-made?). A popular meeting place also in the summer, where one can sit outside at beer garden tables. Also a good after worx hangout. The beautiful large heavy sturdy wood tables are used often also for project meetings. Meals, drinks, work, chat, hanging out in an area with bar. It's nice to be here."
4,"I am so happy finding this place through windy day of Hamburg. Despite of its small space and no chair, their food is super satisfying. That day, they only sold two choices of dishes: spaghetti (€7) and lasagna (€12). I ordered spaghetti topped with sorta white fish and tomato sauce. It came with big portion for my late lunch. The fish topping was generous and its sauce is pretty good, not too sour. You can choose some of beverages served. I ordered ingwer-minze-tee because I need hot beverage to reduce the windy effect to my body. I think I chose the right drink because it really boosted my mood. Thanks!!"
1,"The food was great..but the service was really bad..when we were ordering,the waitress was really impatient and a little rude..she was in a hurry and basically ignored the details we were telling her..we ordered a large juice and a small one was served..when we asked about it,she said that they never serve large juices (the last time we were there, i ordered the exact same thing in a large size, so it does exists..and we actually witnessed another guest ordering the large one and actually managed to get it) and we ordered chicken with pikant sauce, which then was served as a suß sauer one. When asked about the mistake, the waitress said that she didn't mess up..it is what it is..it is pikant and suß sauer (beides) and that we can't order pikant OR suß sauer, which clearly was a lie because the last time we ordered the same menu,it was pikant OR suß sauer, not AND. It had no pikant taste at all. How stupid does she think we are though..Seems like she lied to stay out of trouble. ( we ate it anyway because we did't want to create any fuss) When paying,the waiter actually asked whether i was going to give a tip or not..i honestly said no, because i was dissappointed in the service..it wasn't like we expected red carpet treatment or anything..we just wanted what we ordered (and not being lied to). After i said no, the waiter actually gave me a grunt which i found quite rude. Anyhow, i honestly think that the food was undeniably great. I can't lie about that. But it is better not to come there on busy hours, because this might happen to you as well. Communicating was a little bit hard since they didn't speak much german or english. So getting the right order might take some time. Something they clearly don't have the patience for."
2,"I was not happy with the cocktails I ordered: - Moskow Mule the taste was completely off and they did not serve it in a moscow mule mug- Whiskey sour is too sour :)The service was fast and friendly though, the atmosphere was a chillaxing one and the music was just right."
3,"sehr lecker, leider lassen die Toiletten zu wünschenaber das essen ist super. nicht dieses Standard glutamat China essen von um der Ecke"
3,"Really nice bar in the heart of St.pauli, good vibes and great music all around.It was crowded from the moment we went in until we left  at around 4am, as I'm going out but never until such hour I was rather surprised.We wet there on a Friday, so the party went on and on- from German pop hits to Hip Hop, 80's and Soul- almost every song was right on. People kept dancing, drinking and smiling despite the density.I was barely sitting down, just when I was really tired, so thumbs up for the DJ.Drinks are fairly priced.However, one thing that bothered me was the cigarette smell- for such a crowded and small place, it's better if people would smoke outside, because it seems like there's no ventilation system, couldn't breathe at some point.Places like this make me value fresh air- and hate how I smell later."
3,"Why has nobody ever reviewed Rosi's Bar in English? Could it be because whenever the English end up this far into a St. Pauli weekender they can no longer differentiate between any of the bars on Hamburgerberg?! I suspect so. Anyway, Rosi's trivia: the girl with the dreads from Zoe 2 DJ's here at the weekends sometimes. It's always packed Thursday till Sunday morning. It doesn't look anything like the photo, cause you have to imagine the mass of people sprawled on the pavement. All good fun, and probably better than the Reeperbahn"
4,"Sehr schönes, gemütliches Café/Bistro mit toller Getränke- und Speisekarte im Shenzhen Schanzenviertel. Die Pfannekuchen und Säfte kann ich besonders empfehlen. Preisklasse: mittel, aber definitiv jeden Cert wert!"
4,"This restaurant is located on a small cobblestone street close to Hafen City. The restuarant itself is very small and they only have one table for up to 5 people outside and indoor seating as well. I went there during a non busy time and the place was empty. The lady working behind the counter was really nice and recommended the blackfish with the potatoes and a side salad. I am really glad i took the reccomendation the food was abosolutely delicious! The fish was very fresh and delicious and the potatoes were cooked to perfection. The side salad wasnt bad either! They have fritz cola as well. Between the excellent service, the food, location and price I was really glad I decided to stop by."
2,"Update: I have to take this place down a notch. They are now vegetarian and everything which used to include meat now has some kind of tofu replacement or isn't on the menu anymore. This definitely takes them down a notch when it comes to many breakfast options.....bacon.....you can't take away bacon folks! It's a god-given right!Had breakfast here this morning with a friend and business partner and came away pleasantly surprised. There have been a lot of comments all over the place both on Yelp and Qype about this place. I had been at ""Don't Tell Mama"" in their previous location and really liked the cheesecake but service sucked and the location was a hassle for me. Had meant to come here forever but finally had the chance. I am finnicky about breakfast and very few places in Hamburg do it right. Mamalicious did a pretty good job. The eggs benedict were quite good as was a 3-egg scramble (with dried tomatoes and feta cheese). Coffee was tasty too. I had a fruit smoothie which was so so but I think it was more the mix of fruit verses anything else that didn't let it shine. All in all a nice location with outdoor seating as well (does get loud due to busy street right there). Service was really nice but we were first ones in the door in the morning and it wasn't that busy. Unfortunately, hash browns were out. No idea how something is already out right at opening and found this a bit odd but so be it. All in all we were happy with breakfast and enjoyed the place. I plan on coming back and hope not to find all the gripes which have been mentioned: too loud music, slow service nor missing food items, etc. This place is good but could very easily tip over to mediocre. As long as you get good service and they have everything available you should be happy with this place. Prices are a bit steep too but hopefully you're getting quality for that and they do use organic products (or so they say) and mention having a local, quality butcher for their meat. Let's hope that the second visit is just as good if not better."
4,"I have definitely reviewed the Hafenbahnhof before. But since Qype doesn't remember, here I go again! It feels like miles away although certain people may argue it's not, it is. But don't let that put you off. Great views of the docks out of the windows whilst you sip a cold astra and watch Hamburg's very own Ricky Kings play. It's all good."
4,"Hundreds of positive reviews, so you know this place is fantastic. It is a reason (for me) to come to Germany in the first place. Some advice:-Email in advance for a tour. It is reasonably priced, they can assign you an English speaking guide, and you get to go behind the scenes. You can see underneath the airport, hidden charging areas, a shocking amount of infrastructure underneath the models, and a whole lot of explicit scenes that can only really be seen from behind!-Push the buttons to watch stuff happen. There is a chocolate factory action button. The chocolate is just OK but it's still fun.-The food in the cafe is decent, and is kitschy as hell but fun.-If you're here on a weekend, put your bulky stuff in the lockers as it can be crowded up top-Budget a few hours to be here."
3,High end steak house with good steaks from various countries and nice wines...though I personally feel they overpriced the California wines (I am from the US and know the California wine prices in the US).  Atmosphere is high end.  Interior is clean and nice.  Prices are high but worth the overall experience. Just don't buy the Cali wines.
2,"On the + side:- The restaurant is centrally located: Gansemarkt- Pizzas are affordable and gigantic (be ready to ask for your doggy bag)- There are daily extra dishes, which widen your options- Staff is friendly and attentive- There is a terrace, which is great on a sunny/warm day- There is a bar counter, so you could go for a drink or eat alone without feeling awkward- Good place for a bunch of friends to have a laugh or a family who wants to feed hungry kidsOn the - side:-It's one of those restaurants where the sound control is so wrong that it feels like you are in a canteen; it's ridiculously loud making a proper conversation challenging.-Ok pizzas are huge but when you really look at them, it's basically a huge crust of white flour with a bit of oil; if you put together the toppings, you realize that it's acually less than what a regular pizza would encompass...welcome to excess of starchy carbs and high glycemy...- I tried dark black pasta with seafood; pasta were overcooked (another canteen feeling) and seafood taste was covered by a way too heafty oil dressing...All in all, quite ok, I dont think I would recommand it though I wouldnt want to go back there eitherThere are better italians in town with better atmospheres"
4,"Whenever in Germany, I always make an effort to visit the Hofbräu house.I've been to the other location here in Hamburg, but this location on Esplanade has a more authentic vibe based on the original Hofbräu Haus in Munich.Came here this time with a large group from work (in Germany for an Expo), and everyone was pleased and enjoyed the evening.Most of us ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which is my favorite.You simply must make an effort to dine here."
4,"Love this place!!! Amazing Turkish coffee and fantastic selection of Turkish sweets , baked goods and puddings. Yum!!"
2,"Beach clubs as beach clubs go, just stopped in for an after-work gig and it was relatively empty. Filled up quite fast though. Decent selection of grill stuff, booze and lots of seating actually not in the sand. Sweet location, nice that it's in the neighborhood and don't have to trek all the way down to the river to hit up a Strandbar."
4,"Wow is all I can say about this restaurant. The atmosphere was lively with an authentic Chinese feel. The food was absolutely fantastic, one of the best meals I've had in Hamburg. I cannot believe I've lived down the street for so long and not came here sooner. Be sure to call ahead because it was packed"
4,"Since I'm an Asian, I dare to say this Japances Restaurant is very very traditional and their cooking is fantastic. Even they have Teppanyaki, there is not much in Hamburg. I'm sure I will try it next time."
2,"Having been to the original location in Munich, the Hamburg location was a little disappointing.  Service was very slow and staff was really much less interactive with our table.  Food is not bad, there certainly weren't any surprises, but I felt the food at the Munich location was a step above what we had in Hamburg.  If you are in Germany and will not have a chance to hit up the location in Munich, its certainly a place to try if you have a few days, but I would honestly recommend another location for good local German food.  This location is definitely for tourists from outside of Germany."
3,"The one time I have been here, I ordered the chicken schnitzel with Spätzle and it was very delicious! I had one of their alsterwassers but this time decided to try out the dark version of it and it was even more yummy than the regular one. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
3,"From the branches of Vapiano I've visited in Hamburg, this is by far my favorite. It's often packed until the kitchen closes at 23:00 during the week (there are not many restaurants in the area so Vapiano is a default choice for many) but it's still rather large and roomy. Service is really friendly and prices are well decent. I love their shrimp penne in lobster sauce and carrots. Recommended!"
4,"Friendly, Cosy, Delicious.This place is our second home. The staff is super positive, quick and always welcoming. You have got a million choicesfrom breakfast, potatoes over chicken in peanut sauce, wraps. pancakes to Giros. There is always something you are longing for. The fresh joices and cocktails take you to the lost summer AND the place even has SOYA milk for all us lactose intollerant people. Oh and the Martini comes in a martini glass.AND comes at a very good price. I bet James B. would come here if he ever had another case in HamburgMy only suggestion would be to come up with a weekly special, which is not on the menu and could surprise regulars like us!And of course as always the toilette review: they are clean, but a touch of comfort could be added. Some vintage style accessoires or something.I gotta say, it is my favorite place in the Schanze  don't know what we would do without it."
3,"Been there for lunch. The decoration is very nice and it feels very cosy. The service is ok, but not as friendly as I would wish for in a restaurant.I ordered a duck curry and was surprised when I received a sour chicken soup as a starter. For lunch I wasn't used to that and it tasted really nice. The main course was also tasty and I can also recommend it for people who want the option to order their dishes ""Thai spicy"".Unfortunately the tast has it's price. About 13€ for a lunch dish is already a premium."
4,"The niciest coffee shop in Hamburg. Absolutely love it! It's run and decorated with so much care and taste, that it's worth just to go and check it out. And if you'll only see these freshly baked pies, tall and brown, with apples, poppy seeds, blackberries, rhubarb, plums anything you can imagine (depends on the season of course), you know there's no escape! They all stand on the table to tease your gastro-imagination, there are plates and cutlery next to it, whipped cream too, if you want. Of course, white table cloth, beautifull china, classic furniture. Let me tell you more about furniture: the whole place is like a living room of somebody's apartmet. There's wallpaper, paintings and drawings, tiffany lamps, wooden tables and chairs. It's intimate and warm, cosy and classy. It's nice and welcoming atmosphere both in the evnings and at the daytime. There's a garden for warmer parts of the year. There is variety of teas and coffees to go with these fabulous pies. They also serve food. And I heard that sunday brunch is fantastic (that's what I'm gonna check next), just make sure you are early enough!"
2,"Let's see I went there on a bank holiday for the all you can eat for 19,9EurI will assess the good points (+) and review  the level of improvement(-) that place needOn the + side- Price: 20euros for running sushis (all you can eat)  with a miso soup/noodle soup - Location: great around Jungfernstieg, perfect break on a shopping day or after a work out- Atmostphere: Japanese obviously, casual, sushi bar and enjoy (not just the view) of sushi constantly running in front of you.Many (German) tourists, who have no idea what eel or octopus are...right...anyway-Food: Sushi, some sashimi (otherwise resquest for it), different kind of fish, algae +++ and japanese mushroom salads++. The ingredients quality is quite remarkable...at least what's available (see  needs improvement part)- Staff: all efficient mostly friendlyOn the needs improvement side:- Food: A few items which are listed on the menu are out of order quite often (Soy beans and some fish) even on request...too badThe ratio fish/rice for sushi is 1/9, which is ridiculous, it's like a thin slice of fish with a heafty portion of rice; of course they are just trying to fill stomachs which would work just the time for you to leave the restaurant considering the high glycemic index of white rice...All  in all a good place on the go, however without the binging all you can eat, I would go elsewhere to enjoy better sliced and better fish/rice ratio sushis..."
3,"Fabulous brunch on Sunday! A bit pricy but it includes juices and coffee, so actually just fine.. lots of veggies, warm and cold dishes...... nice service... great bread... all good!"
1,"Tried their cheeseburger last night. The meat tasted odd and was too finely grained, rather like sausage meat.Service was friendly, although there was a lack of attention to detail."
4,"Great little cafe in the middle of a passage shopping area. They have awesome coffee, as well as ice cream cones. The area is great to sit and watch people going by, and at times in the afternoon there is even live music playing in the shopping area. It is nicely done, and reasonably priced."
4,"Most delicious tapas. Had a birthday dinner here and I have never had more mussels for 9€. We almost couldn't finish them, but we did. Totally recommend, the house wine is so easy to drink. Love this place!"
4,"Things to know about this place: it's very centrally located, just around the corner from the Rathaus, it's actually open in the late evenings (unlike most places in this district), and it has really nice local beers (called Messing and Kupfer). The food is very decent as well."
3,"Great French pastries and good coffee as well! Nice tortellettes and eclairs. Friendly service. Has cute French photos decorating the walls. Is unfortunately a bit too small for my taste (also no toilet)  there were only 2 tables inside, making it more of a Stehcafé where you can stop for a quick yummy French treat. Wish they could expand so you could really enjoy sitting there for a while!Recommended for a short stop in Paris!"
4,"I come here for the take-out falafel wraps. I normally buy one, then walk just down the road, buy a beer from sofabar and sit in the sun with my weizen & falafel. Perfect. I am yet to sit in the restaurant, but it looks perfectly pleasant."
3,I had the vegan pancakes called Roxen. It was served with fruits and apple puree. The portion was really huge. Next to that I ordered a lactose free cappuccino with oat milk. I was only able to eat one of the twopancakes. The pancakes could be a little bit sweeter. The atmosphere is cozy and hip. The service was good and friendly.
4,"Skyline 20up Bar is located at the 20th level of the Empire Riverside Hotel. A lot of tables were already booked when we arrived and the inside is quite small, so I advise you to come early or book your own. The bar offers you a great view on Sankt Pauli, Altona and Harburg. Their cocktails are amazing and not like the usual ones, there is a good research on the texture, colour and presentation."
2,"YES VAPIANO IS POPULARYES VAPIANO IS FRESHBut it's overrated. I wouldn't consider this as a restaurant. It's a upscale fastfood chain since you get a card at the entrance to pay your ordered food with. It's a marketing strategy since you pay with a plastic card and not with real money, you lose the awareness of the value.And at the canteen you'll take a tray and after 15 min of waiiting in line hopefully you got your meal.This is not bad at all. I like it crowdy and waiting for someone to free their table so we can sit. No seriously I think it's fun :DThe only thing why I gave it 3 stars is because I'm always still hungry when I leave Vapiano. The dish you order comes with a huge bowl or plate or whatever but the actual food covers only 1/3 of it. And I refuse to order another one.  THAT'S THE CATCH. People order more because one dish is too little.I REFUSE bitches!"
4,Fantastic experience and customer service. We accidentaly bought tickets for the wrong day and they let us join the tour anyway. The chocolate is amazing and we had so so so much fun!
0,"Really bad cappuccino. We got a quiche each which was served with salad. In my opinion it was overpriced and not tasty.We went there because of the excellent reviews this place got, but i really dont see why this is ranked as one of the best brunch places in Hamburg. Not recommended"
3,"Really good pizza. Too big to finish! Free Sambucha shots with the receipt, nice touch. Free bubbly while you wait for a table too. Watch out though, they pour you San Pelegrino water without asking, of you drink it, €5 added to your cheque. A very nice experience overall and a tasty lunch the next day ;)"
4,"In the immortal words of superhans: ""What the f*'s a washing machine doing in a pub?! Jesus, I need a drink!"". Not only a washing machine either - a bed, table football, and a real hi-fi system. This place is kinda like hanging around in your own house, only you don't have to clean it when all your friends spill drinks everywhere. What a concept! I'm gonna take it to the UK..."
2,"As usual took half an hour to queue to get in here, then we were sat in the window so the queue could get then watch us eat our meal. The food is OK, the service friendly and I get the local loyalty from a Hamburg chain-done-good but each time I visit Block House I vow never again. There are a lot of much better places to eat in Hamburg."
1,"The sushi and other plates here aren't at all good tasting. There's a 20 euro ""all you can eat"" deal where you sit at a rotating table and grab dishes. It's not a waste of money (since unlimited food), but I couldn't say I thought any of the dishes had much flavor. The fish is low-quality, the rice is okay, and the presentation is kinda sloppy. There's not great sushi in Hamburg, but there's definitely way better sushi than here."
4,Best weekend breakfast in town! Lovely terrace when the weather permits. Great coffee in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
3,"The best place for a hamburger in Hamburg.Always busy mainly because of the location on Jungfernsteig but also down to the speed, service and quality of what's on offer.Great value, cheaper and a lot nicer than a McDonalds!As a tip on the best time to come i would suggest Sundays as you can get served within a few minutes and eadily find somewhere to sit."
3,"This is close to a hidden gem. Tiny fish shop with a fair sized menu. When you place your order, it is immediately cooked so always fresh. Unfortunately this means that the place smells fishy; literally. The food is great though. I had the mixed teller that has several fish and potatoes. Delicious! My friend had the fish and chips. While the fish is definitely lacking, the chips were proper British!"
0,Worst service i have ever experienced ... 20 minutes wait just to order... 30 minute wait to get food... 20 minute wait to get another drink... 15 minutes still waiting for the guy to deign to bring us the check so we can ask for a to go box... Which will take another hour!! He passes us by to clean a table while were trying to ask for a check... He just walks away... The food is crap as well ... But this seems to be a theme in this city...
4,"How is this the first English review of Speicherstadt? Speicherstadt is basically a must-see part of Hamburg. In the past this set of islands was used as a duty-free zone for ships to unload, with customs only coming into force as you crossed one of the many bridges. Nowadays the old warehouses hold a few tourist attractions like the Hamburg Dungeon and the Miniature railway. Randomly they also hold the largest amount of persian rugs outside of Tehran! (Or so I've heard)"
4,It is a pretty friendly environment with lots of options of coffee and cake-desert mixtures. Even dough there are available place for sitting around 50-70 people you will be in need of waiting a bit(aprox.5-15 min). I tried their late- macchiato - delicious -made of some kind of Rwanda origin beans. Hint: If you sit in those bar chairs a bit later your back hurts so try to get a table sitting option. Pretty good location btw- if you couldnt find anywhere at schanze or before going there after Sternschanze subway station have a break here.Highly recommended.
2,"Firstly, the food is simple but tasty. A little bit expensive for some eggs and toast though. We we're sitting for ages waiting to be given a menu, maybe you had to go get one yourself, which I ended up doing. Waited another age to be served, the staff were more interested in cleaning tables. It wasn't even that busy. We didn't get the portions of home fries we ordered on the side and had to remind the girl after our main meal was almost gone. They came out 5 minutes later. All in all, could rate it higher of the staff were a little more attentive!"
4,"I was on a free walking tour of Hamburg, and was brought to this area. And that's what it is. An area of old warehouses, many of which played a key role in the economic development of this city and country.The place is really photogenic. I was surprised at how many photos I wanted to take. The network of canals flowing between the warehouses create some wonderful photo ops, and it was also interesting to learn about the history of the buildings. I would recommend taking one of the free walking tours for this reason.The Miniatur Wunderland is in the area, so that's another reason to check it out. See my review of that for more info!"
3,"An Irish man in Germany going to an Irish bar to drink German beer. I'm sure there's a joke in there someone. Usually, I am loathe to go to Irish bars when I travel, usually because they are stereotypical. Luckily, Irish Rover is nothing like that. Stone walls and exposed wood gives a great rustic feel to the place. Kilkenny, Guinness, and Bulmers are available, along with a fine selection of Irish whiskeys including a fantastic Tyrconnell 10 year Madeira cask and my personal favourite Green Spot, as well as some lovely German beers.There's a reasonably large patio out the front that over looks a square, and is great to sit in on a warm summer's evening. The staff are friendly, and super accommodating. Reasonably priced, and well located - this is definitely a bar to check out when in Hamburg. I would have liked to have seen a larger selection of beers, so Irish Rover only gets 4 stars."
4,I was there by accident. A friend was just showing me around in his neighbourhood. We were having a cheap but excellent coffee there. .....Mister Lars Herden was just roasting some coffee beans and started to explain the manufacturing process to us...He took quite some time to make us understand the difference between normal industrial coffee and his excellent product...I will definitely come back. Love this authentic wonderful place ;)
1,"Dinner for two on Friday night! Showing up at 6 o'clock we were the only guests. The restaurant filled up quickly. The service was friendly and fast, implicating that the food was premade... We ordered humus as a starter. Unfortunately we returned most of it. The bread was stale. The main dish was nothing special. The rice was over cooked.Besides that the location and the service were good. Might return to grab a drink but no food!"
4,"Can't believe I am the first one to write a review on this world-class museum! International Maritime Museum in Hamburg has information on absolutely everything related to maritime history of the world: from Vikings to Jacques-Yves Cousteau. The museum was opened in summer 2008 as a home to the biggest in the world private maritime collection. And believe me, this collection is enormous: 10 storeys filled with boat models, sea maps, navy uniforms, weapons, mini boat models and much much more. In fact it is so overwhelming, that I could hardly manage the last storey. Information provided on English as well, there are a lot of 'interaction points' so that you don't get bored. The entry is not cheap but it's so worth it. In two words: highly recommended!"
3,"I absolutely loved this place. Was in Hamburg on business and was trying to check out some local restaurants that were also trendy. Went with 4 of my colleagues and we had such a wonderful time - the linguini was fantastic and the wine (Nero) was impeccable. We especially enjoyed the two waiters who were warm, helpful and full of life. Charming experience!"
4,"The handmade ice cream was so good and fresh, the staff was so helpful and friendly, the shop was so clean.  The affigato is a must try!!   Will definitely be back for more!!!"
3,As a british man Indian curries are extremely important to us as they are our nation's favourite.  The service was polite and authentic as was the choice of two Indian beers. My wife chose a wine and it was very nice which is rare in a curry house and we shared the 2 person tandoori platter. It was a lot of food but very very nice.
4,"twice I have eaten here and I have to add, the best Falafel I have eaten. The staff is really friendly, which is a plus when the place is full. I totally recommend it!"
3,This is my first salad's place in Hamburg and it turned out to be great. Best thing is you can create your own salad with awesome sauces. There was a queue at lunch time but salad was great.I will definitely go again!
4,"Here you'll find the best burger in Hamburg, bar none. So 5 stars.However, they could really do with redecorating. It feels more like a conference room than the cosy meaty paradise that it should be. Ah well, I'm sure they'll sort that out in time.Back to the food. They have a range of about 10 burgers, all of which are going to set you back about EUR12, so they're not cheap. They are however freshly made, using fresh meat, which allows the server to ask How would you like that cooked? Rare, Medium-rare. I went for medium-rare, which anywhere else in Hamburg would be a recipe for extreme food-poisoning, but here you just get the great extra taste.Extra props for having two blue-cheese burgers on the menu."
3,Food was good not great! However the ambience was some what comfortable. Staff was kind and prompt.
4,Germany's freshest. Simple place with super friendly staff. Excellent dishes all around our family of 4. Deserts were amazing too!  Given our variety of our dishes my conclusion is that you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!  Go!!!!
4,"I can't believe I've missed this little gem for so long! Meine kleinraumdisko is a deceptively tardis-like bar/club just opposite the REAL supermarket by Feldstrasse U-bahn. Low key beats being mixed at conversational volume, cool sofas in a number of corners, trippy visuals on projected on the walls, and Augustina beer for 3 euros (which doesn't give you an Astra-style hangover of death) make it a compelling destination! I'll definitely be spending a lot more time here."
3,"Nice ambience and atmosphere; also friendly staff. Typical food selection chicken, Schnitzel, Currywurst and a bit of fish. The best place to start the night at Reperbahn having something to eat or drink. A bit more expensive than usually for this type of food, but due location it's worth it."
4,"These type of traditional places are disappearing quickly...don't miss this one. Close to the Hauptbahnhof, great for a quick meal and a beer!"
3,"The place is quite small but beautifully situated and it is serving good fish dishes. The service is very helpful and nice. The owner is a nice and chatty guy. Unfortunately there's no toilet and one must use one in ice cream spot next to it, which is kinda awkward. One must also know that there are few places to sit. Nevertheless place worth visiting."
3,"It's difficult to find good Asian restaurants in Germany that try to deliver a food experience close enough to their native kitchen in their homeland. The Quan Do is certainly a recommendation for those who despise the stereo-typical, sweet-sour fast food style pseudo Asian kitchen. The food is fresh, simple and soul soothing. For friends of a good Pho this is a good address. I also like their summer rolls.The staff is always friendly and competent, you can tell they like working there. The place is always crowded and does not take reservations, so at peak times you need to calculate some waiting time to be seated. The Quan Do is not a suitable choice if you're in a hurry to grab a lunch for example during your work break.The Quan Do is also nicely decorated with Vietnamese lamps hanging from the ceiling and nice photography of Vietnamese street scenes.I would grant a fifth star if the food was even more authentic to the taste in Vietnam or ethnic tribe area of South China, bordering Vietnam."
3,"Nice local Greek place with decent food and big serving sizes. The staff is very attentive and nice, although very loud in conversations. It's pretty dark inside, but there are also some tables outdoor. The menu is quite diverse and most of the food options are meat. Not five stars yet, but definitely recommendable."
4,"SOOOOOO good! Cheap, amazing food and friendly service!"
2,"Die Lage ist super, der Service ziemlich flott, fast zu schnell. Das Früstück ist lecker aber auch etwas teurer. Ich delber hatte einen Grupon Gutschein (11EUR) über ein Frühstück (wert 22EUR), dies war zwar ok, jedoch auch nur die 11EUR wert, keinesfalls 22EUR. Zudem blieb es so nah auf dem Wasser nicht aus das div. keine Insekten herumschwirrten und sich auf dem Obst, der Wurst oder im Kaffee/ O-Saft niedergelassen haben."
3,"Nice cafe with a chilled vibe. Good coffee and good cake too. Unfortunately, one star deducted for my chocolate cake being on the dry side. May have been sitting out just a bit too long. Yet the mascarpone and cherry cake was great. We sat at the table right on the front window. Best spot in the cafe. I won't deduct a star as they were nice but it took forever to get out coffees which came way after we had the cake on the table. It was kind of full but I found it to have still taken quite long. Will be back and maybe next time it will be better."
4,"OMG Winterhude has a cosy coffee shop with wifi! Cute, not so little coffee and brekkie place with friendly service. Good coffee. And they had some teas too. Can't believe I didn't know this place all along. This place can be a good work from coffee shop place :)"
4,"As everyone knows...I'm addicted to great coffee!! And this is the place to find it. At first I was worried that it was a tourist coffee company and I was happily wrong. The coffee is super strong and fantastic. I was in town with my husband visting a friend and we came here multiple times during our visit. Almost filled the entire stamp card. And I'm also a sucker for a stamp card. I definitely enjoy the cafe itself as well. It's very modern and plenty of space. The service is very friendly. The waitress insisted that I sit down and that I could pay later. The culture in Europe is definitely to not be rushed and sit an enjoy the break in the day. Also who can't be in love with the ""Deathspresso"" icon and slogan!! ""Schlafen kannste du wann du tot bist"", ""You can sleep when you're dead!""Wach auf Hamburg!!"
2,"I found the place a bit over-priced for what you get. Standard Thai food without that extensive a menu. Further, service was mediocre at best. No one went the extra mile and it was default all night. Lots of people have already spoken well of the location and ambiance. I'd say it's good but not outstanding. There are better views of the harbor as well as in the Hafencity. Finally, I found the bathrooms to not be that clean. I was already there pretty late in the evening but if you are going to charge these prices, make sure someone is regularly keeping the washrooms tidy. I probably wouldn't go back, mostly due to the pricing for average Thai food. It's worth checking out though if you must do something in the Hafencity and you like Thai. Maybe we just hit a bad night for the chef."
0,Got it to go. As far as getting it on time great job. However very disappointing sushi. They were falling apart. The fried sushi was stuffed with what tasted and looked like canned tuna. The fish tasted old and we felt very unwell afterwards. We were supposed to get squid sushi but it was not in the package. Everything was either horrible or tasteless.
3,"Pony bar - yeah, not a bad bar. In close proximity to the Abaton cinema too, so ideal for a post-film drink/discussion of how intense the latest Rambo film was. Just joking, they don't show John Rambo in the Abaton, but I wasn't joking about how intense that film was. Especially the archery scene. Anyway - packed with students, one sign of its next to Hamburg Uni. The other being that you can pick up their WiFi. There's loads of action here."
4,"Fantastic burgers!!! Hands down one of the best I've had. The burgers are cooked very well (I recommend medium) with lots of flavors from the portables mushrooms and spinach. Highly recommend the Truffel burger with 1 patty (about 8 euros) with the pale ale beer (about 3.8 euros). The Pommes are excellent as well, you can get 1 to share. Definitely try it out!"
4,Very good food with cheap price especially for Arab people because you can fond traditional Arabic food. You can get all you can eat option with 7.5 euros. They have also good tea.
3,"If you are looking for a nice little Italian restaurant in hamburg then you should go there. They serve a really good pizza and also the pasta is good. The atmosphere is quite nice if you don't look at all the Italian kitsch around you. It's very small, so be there on time or reserve a table."
4,"Good food and great service. I would have given this place 4 stars but added one star for the owner/chef who was personally serving us; this guy is great and funny too. It is a small place and so not good for big groups. They have a set menu (which supposedly changes every week or so) but if you like seafood, you should try it. The price is OK for Hamburg."
4,"OMG! I never thought I will have multiple orgasms in a museum (almost). For everybody whose heartbeat goes up from fast racing cars, it's a must see. Absolutely professional presentation, and even interesting for kids (but you have to watch them constantly so that they don't touch the cars). Toilets, nappy changing room are also top class. Otherwise quiet and relaxed atmosphere, you can take your time to explore the past and present of the fastest racing cars of the world."
2,Not sure how this place got such high ratings. We made reservations since we heard it was highly recommended to reserve a table. My husband is a vegetarian and his co-workers told him about the restaurant. Just about everything on the menu had either mushrooms (which I dislike) or eggplant (not a big fan). We ordered a Tassajara Ice Tea which was bitter and not to our liking but we forced it down. I wished I had gotten juice or the Mango Lassi. My husband ordered the mix salad and I ordered the soup. The soup arrive hot and in a rather big bowl for German standards. I was hopeful the Eggplant Curry would be spicy and flavoured but it left a lot to be desired. It was bland and the only bright spot was that it arrived hot. The side salad and rice was tasty but nothing to get excited about. We decided to pass on desserts although they did look rather tasty.
4,"My boyfriend and I headed to this area without a reservation. We tried one other place with slightly higher reviews without luck. Choose this restaurant by chance, because it was close by and honestly, I am glad the first place turned us down because this restaurant was exactly what I wanted! They were able to seat us within 10 mins and even let me bring my small dog, as long as she stayed under the table (which she did the whole time, because my dog is perfect in every way). This place was packed but the service was extremely fast. The wait staff were running around nonstop to get everyone their food and drinks. It was the best service I've gotten since moving to Germany. The menu was in English and the wait staff were able to talk to us in English as well. They were very courteous.We ordered a bottle of the Vino Verde, 4 tapas (Spanish omellete, peppers, dates with bacon and mushrooms) and the mixed grilled seafood platter. It was our only meal of the day and still we had trouble finishing it and had to take some home. The tapa portions were generous and the fish platter was huge. I would order every single of these dishes again when I come back (and I will). The Vino Verde was great too. Everything was about 75 euros, which I think is more than reasonable. All in all, instantly one of my favourite places in Hamburg."
3,"Great food, drink and cocktails too. great location. a definite improvement on the rather snooty Ratsweinkeller that used to be there."
2,"The Bullerei is located in a great location: a red brick building where the former slaughterhouses of Hamburg were located. This restaurant seems to get a lot of fame and attention from its celebrity TV chef Tim Mälzer, who owns it.Service was good and attentive, the food was good, but nothing special, prices are quite high for what you get. They specialize in meat, so that is maybe better, I did not have that since that costs even more.Not a must do but always a can do. The big open space all seats are in is not that cozy and inviting, for my taste.The Bullerei has a separate ""lunch"" / Deli kind of area in the front with a different menu.Will probably be back casually."
4,"We stumbled onto this wonderful place when visiting Hamburg in 2011.  We were treated with a hip interior, tasty treats, and friendly staff. Owner's attention to details is not only on the food, but shows through each reclaimed materials and objects throughout this depot. Definitely was a highlight of our visit!"
4,"A cozy, tasteful room tucked into a pretty corner of Hamburg. We went for the 9-course ""classic"" menu with wine pairings. A truly wonderful journey through food and wine, punctuated with a main course of Ibérico pork, unbelievably tender and layered with flavors. On each plate, the juxtaposition of varied elements allows multiple facets o taste - every dish having a multitude of flavor complementary profiles. A world-class experience."
4,"Mix with the locals and treat yourself to a phenomenal casual weekday lunch or early dinner at Fischfeinkost Delikatessen des Meeres (which roughly translates to: Fischfeinkost delicacies of the sea). This place is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a foodie, you have to check it out. If you're not a foodie, you should still check it out. The reviews are super impressive and very well deserved, and popular with the locals it is. Always a great sign, right?Ok, so here's the deal: you enter the space down a few stairs from the street level. You order your dish and a drink at the counter. The place is made up of a pretty cramped connection of tiny rooms with only a few tall tables around. Some with stools. Most without. But in pleasant weather, the great majority of folks are outside on the open sidewalk umbrella-covered tables that are pretty much full of people either enjoying their food or waiting for their food. When they have a bunch of dishes ready, they put them out on the counter and ring a bell. What? No, I'm not kidding. Then a bunch of customers just swoop right in and grab their dishes. Apparently everyone is a regular and already knows the drill, but I still have no idea how people know who gets what or when that bell ring is for them or not. Just bizarre, but it certainly seems to work. These are very happy diners, for sure. Luckily for me, the counter-lady was really sweet and clued in this rather clueless American when my dish was included in which bell ringing round.I had ordered the seafood lasagna w/carpaccio. Sounded amazing, and it certainly was. OMG. Happy me! Delic!! Lovely fresh pasta and veggies in a somewhat deconstructed lasagna style with a lot of yummy broth. Somewhat soupy. Just fantastic. The other dish available that day was a swordfish with potatoes on a bed of greens. Looked amazing and appeared to be the most popular. The Chef creates the menu each day of only 1 or 2 dishes, based on the freshest ingredients available in the markets that day. Brilliant! Simple concept. Simple food. Nothing fancy. Just fantastically prepared super fresh big plates of homey food. Everyone brings out their own flatware/napkin/drink to their tables, picks up their own dish from the counter when ready, and self-busses and drops off their dirty plates when they're done. Highly highly recommended!"
3,"Fresh fish, fast service, nice waiters, card or cash for pay. I didn't like Tom Yam, but rolls are tasty and look good."
3,"Super cute place! Very American, love how they cater to vegetarians! But I will say that it would prob be in your best interest to get there around 8am or earlier or after 1pm. It's very small inside. Maybe less than 14 tables and I'm highballing it. Well worth the experience and very reasonably priced. Portions are large so if you are American like us please know you can not order multiple things like how we do at IHOP or Waffle House and eat off of those small plates. Literally you will be full off of one plate. Oh yea and I had THE best veggie burger I've ever had and I don't normally like veggie burgers but this was amazing."
4,"I came all the way from Houston Texas, which has a very large Vietnamese population, to taste some of the best Pho I have ever had. I recommend the Pho with chicken and meatballs. If noodle soup is not your thing then try the Vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken. I actually started an account on Qype because of this place! Lecker Lecker!"
3,"Great Sushi in a great location. Food was spot on. The day we visited was super hot. It's a bit on the expensive side, so don't be surprised about your check. I definitely would go again. The waitstaff is friendly and easy on the eyes. Thanks guys."
4,"My favorite bar in my favorite street of Hamburg, as they fit perfectly together. Both a mix of trashy & classy combined with a laid-back atmosphere and timeless interior. I really like the old gymnastics furniture, now function as sofas to sit down on..The big icebear in the corner is a pretty funny item too, as it doesnt fit into the context at all.. The coffee is delicious, already addicted to their caffee latte machiato. You can smell the homemade pastas at every corner of this cosy bar, which makes you crave for one..even when you not hungry. You order at the bar, which can be annoying when it gets crowded in the weekends, but it does create a peaceful moment when you dont have stressed staff coming up to your table asking you what else you would like...Yes, that may sound strange..but I experienced it in that sort of a way..Just do your own thing. The background music is divers but always good varying from electronic sounds in the weekends and funky jazz/lounge during the week. And if you dont feel like talking...there are tons of magazines to update your knowlegde about anything youd like..5 stars cause its a great picture all together!"
4,"As the city hall in Hamburg, it definitely make the city shines even more. The building is not only huge, historical, and also grand. It looks really different with most of the city halls I have been visit. It certainly has it own charm. I also like to check out the little detail around the building, really brilliant.In front of the city hall, the square might looks a bit dull. But there is also popular for events. From time to time, it holds different events. The city hall itself is really close to most of famous and my favourite sights in Hamburg.  From here to Alster only took around ten mins on foot, very convenient. It also got some nice cafes and restaurants. Although I have been this place already couple times, I still didn't really have a chance to pay a visit inside the building. Pity, I think, it must look as good as outside. I really like it this place. It probably is the most beautiful city hall I have seen so far in Germany."
4,"Wow! So good! Don't make the mistake I did when I was new in the city and eat at the bus terminal, walk about 5 mins to here and eat like a king. My favorite was Adona kebab."
4,"Excellent vibe and great selection of craft biers! Visited on a mid-Saturday afternoon. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and knew their biers. The pulled pork sandwich was also huge and probably one of the largest sandwiches I've ever had. I'll definitely return!"
3,This restaurant/bar is right at the end of the Reeperbahn. Its large and had some interesting interior decorations. Definitely worth looking into it.The food was yummy and the beer was tasty. Thats what we needed after a long walk through hamburg. Thanks guys.
4,The best bakery in town lived across the road and queued up most Sundays for the incredibly perfect bread and brötchen. Worth the funny wait while you can see dramatic scenes of Eimsbüttle mums with their mini twin kids and all the guys passing by hoping for freebies? On of the last good bakeries who not just bake factory prefabricated dough.
4,"As an American, I eat Mexican food often! It's rare you leave North America and travel across the Atlantic to find Mexican food as good, maybe better than where you started. Jim Burrito is a great place to have yourself a Burrito or Quesadilla! Everything we tried was authentic and more importantly, DELICIOUS! Go there!"
3,Ordered burger champignon and tartufo. Both good. CP - value good. An economic choice in between all touristic places.
4,"I went here last night with my family and we all absolutely loved this place! I got the spätzle with pesto,rocket and cherry tomatoes. The spätzle was perfectly flavored and had just the right amount of cheesiness. The cheese spätzle was also delicious. 5 stars, no doubts."
4,Incredible restaurant! We had our wedding party here and the employees went above and beyond to help us make it special. Not to mention the food was incredibly delicious! I had the salted sea bass. Yum!!!!!! We will definitely return for more excellent food soon again.
2,"Located in the middle of Portuguese block this restaurant didn't necessarily disappointed but really didn't have anything special. Food was ok, prices were ok. Drinks were ..... small. Being a Hamburg restaurant, I expected fresher seafood. Being a Portuguese cuisine, I expected more flair... Was let down on both ends, but it did served as an ok lunch."
4,"Short version: I love eating at Dean & DavidLong version: I am the biggest lover of meat and cheese so when My doctor said I needed to change my diet I was Glum, I thought you couldn't get nice food that was not full crap.  My girlfriend and I started looking for nice places that were a bit healthier and Dean & David hits the mark perfectly.I am a major fan of the Warm Thai Beef Salad and my girlfriend particularly likes the Parisian Salad, both of us are working through the juices and I am a particular fan of the Ginger Shot although it is not quite as tangy as the ginger juices we make at home.It is very helpful that this store is just round the corner from my work for grabbing something quick but seating space is a little short here and for that reason I prefer here when passing or grabbing a quick something but the one on Georgsplatz 10 when we will sit a while and take our time to eat."
2,"Popular for dogs and the HSV. Different paths to choose from. Dogs should be on the line, this is normally ignored, and once in a while the controllers are out and about.Near by is Lüther Park and its beautiful church. The area has cafes which I will notice for the next time"
2,The 'Erste Liebe Bar' is a well designed modern coffee place in a great location. Away from traffic and noise. The interior is clean and modern with large bar and friendly staff. The breakfast menu is not huge but they have brilliant coffee and fresh juices. All in all a nice place with a pleasant atmosphere.
4,Very good food and incredibly nice staff. The restaurant has a cosy atmosphere. Mango lassi was also tasty.
3,"Nice little family-owned italian bistro in the Altstadt. The pasta menu isn't very diverse but the prices are decent and the service is warm and friendly. Unfortunately the place is rather small and doesn't have proper organization for rain-free outside seating, so make sure to show up with a small party on a sunny day. EDIT: The woman running this joint will give you stares if you don't finish your food!"
3,"I was surprised to see a concept like green lovers here in Hamburg. It reminded me of Mixt Greens in San Francisco.The menu includes suggested salads, a make-your-own salad option, soups, and panini. All of the salads are made fresh when you order. I went with the falafel veggie salad special they had advertised on the counter with the green lovers dressing (herbs, lemon, olive oil). It had a great balance of ingredients and a nice hummus on top. Definitely a fan.Service was also surprisingly friendly despite the lunch rush. Again, other than that whole ordering in German part, I felt like I had just walked through a portal to Mixt Greens in downtown SF.The only downside is that the space is a little tight and is pretty much packed by 12:30pm. If you'd like a place to sit and don't mind getting bumped into every so often, I'd aim for right before noon and stick to parties of 2. The line always moves fast and they offer takeout, so that could be a good plan B if you happen to arrive after half of Hamburg's workforce has."
2,"Came here looking for the infamous last drink, after dinner but, before going home!Impressed that I was able to find somewhere to hang up my coat let alone be able to get to the bar and have service!!  whoop whoop.  Quick with delivering out cocktails we were also able to find some table space.  All this in the run up to Christmas, cold night and in a reasonably packed bar.Dimmed lighting and music providing fun atmosphere.Friendly staff and people.  Towards the end of the night, we even had table service a plus for me.  Gotta love table service in a bar!!The only downside to this bar was the ability to smoke inside.  Not a fan of smoking and not used to smoking inside for a while now, this was a shock to the system, my clothes, hair and lungs.This, for me was the only down side to this bar.  Although, would come again.  :)"
3,"I went here for take-away coffee a few times when I was looking for an apartment in the area. I liked that they have outdoor seating so I could sit outside in the sun between apartment visitings in order to drink coffee and read comic books. Coffee was just okay, though, but service was rather exceptionally cheery. Never got an apartment in the area, but if I would have, I'd hop in here from time to time."
2,"Yes this is a strange one. This restaurant benefits from being in the middle of one of the busiest restaurant areas in Hamburg. So it's more or less always going to be pretty busy. So we were very grateful when we found a table here without having booked. Four adults and 2 kids, it was great, especially when they asked another table to shift off their place for us. Then we watched all night as they moved people around the place all night as new people arrived. I haven't seen that before! It was also freezing outside, but boiing inside, and every time the door opened (which was a lot) we all got a blast of icy air! Overall it wasn't bad, the food was OK, then we had a little dance at the end when we were told they didn't take credit cards but then when I pulled out my Qype wallet, hey presto all of sudden they did! Which was very strange!"
4,"Amazing. I am a bit of a foodie and traveler and this was one of the best restaurants I've dined in. If you are looking for authentic German food, white tablecloth service, a local atmosphere, and an unbelievable price point- look no further. My brother and I stumbled in later in the night, but the kitchen gladly remained open until close and served us with enthusiasm. Our server was lovely and made us feel at home. The food was outstanding (get the pancakes). We ordered a few courses and drinks and our bill was only about €45. We were expecting more. If we return to Hamburg, we will return to Sangers."
4,"(This review is best read in black and white while listening to smooth jazz.)It's like walking into a cliché!Just like there's a moment of eye-pain when you open the blinds a sunny day, there's gonna be a moment of awkwardness when you walk through the door into the super romantic ambience. Just power through. Make joke about it if necessary. Just power through.It's a place designed to get you into a warm fuzzy haze of happiness.Didn't like the chairs though. They're big and bulky, there's too many of them, and I don't like to perform self-origami just to sit down."
3,"Who here shortly after the opening appears, actually always finds a place. That changes completely fast, at the latest if the conception is terminated in the nearby theatre, becomes it here very much full, then one has sometimes the impression the kitchen is something overtaxed (can last already times longer). But for a really good meal first you have tu find the place. No sign points the way to us. One must belong to the insider. The village is accommodated a wine tube, in a cellar, with a remarkably variedly bill of fare."
4,"We had breakfast here, yesterday, and we loved it. Not knowing that it is better to make a reservation, we got lucky after a short wait: They had a table for us! The coffee was the most delicious coffee we ever had and the breakfast absolutely marvelous. I recommend the power bowl!I saw a recommendation here, suggesting that Americans wouldn't be served here, that is b.s.! If tables are empty, that just means someone made a reservation and will be seated there, soon. Our waitress was nice and friendly, the service prompt, we have no complaints. Americans are always very welcome in any German place, since they are known to give great tips. We are from Texas, didn't have any problems, ever!"
1,Bad service even for Germany. Not the best food either. If you want beer and to be ignored go here. If you are actually hungry.... good luck. The sampler platter is not very appealing. Just skip to the entrees and save your self the money.
3,"It is amusing to travel from America to Hamburg to get a hamburger made with American beef in a somewhat Americanized restaurant, but the results are anything but amusing. The burger had the highest beef to bread ratio I have seen. I usually order burgers medium to be safe, but luckily the waitress pointed out this would be a mistake here and they shouldn't be cooked past medium rare.The filthy harry was good enough that I couldn't help but order it each time I came here. Fries are also tasty. The burger is on the expensive side, but for the quality and quantity that you receive it is reasonable. Also it was a bit of a kick to see Anchor Steam beer on the menu."
2,"We ordered 2 Pho, 1 with beef, 1 with chicken. It wasn't bad but there was no ingredients that we could put ourselves in the soup... Normally, you can put coriander, soja beans and squeeze lime yourself which is part of the fun.Their mango-coconut milkshake was delicious though!"
4,"I was here on Thursday night with my husband. We were blown away by our meal and immediately made a reservation to come back for Saturday night even though we only had three nights total in hamburg! The first night we had the protein salad and meze plate and the second we had spring lasagne, sweet potato peanut soup and a pumpkin curry dish. Every bite is amazing. This is an absolute must experience restaurant. Some of the best food we have ever had.  As California foodies, that is saying a lot. And all organic and vegetarian! How is it possible? You have to see for yourself. The hosts are warm, welcoming and personal. Don't miss this special special restaurant. We will think of it for many years to come and will make sure to return."
0,"Absolutely disappointing.Burgers barely have any substance, the homemade ice tea was terrible and there is no service"
3,"their cheesecake is really great.the way steaks are cooked, also excellent. the medium-rare was juicy and soft.only thing I missed was kid's menu."
0,"I was suggested this place and brought to it by my boyfriend. As the ambiance is great, the clientele is anything but high class (the service and food was not much better). Not only did this over-involved couple who stared at us from the moment we walked in, made us feel uncomfortable and then to top it off, on their way out they wrote a very unwelcome note to my boyfriend (who did not speak great English at the time) implying nasty things about me and telling him to get up and leave the table. Mind you, we had been there barely ten minutes, not spoken much and I had never met this couple before in my life. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but considering my man and I were not fighting, nor were we having an argument or any other sort of spat, it was somewhat uncalled for and very rude. I know many people think they are so great at reading people, but trust you YOU ARE NOT. So before you think you can go get involved in others lives, maybe think twice. As for my experience at this place IT WAS DOWNRIGHT FUCKING HORRIBLE following that. Potatoes under-cooked, table water was WARM. Do not bother, not worth the service, nor the food, nor having to deal with the over-entitled, under-educated, arrogant clientele that this place attracts."
3,Good location and delicious cakes. But the wifi is very slow when I wanted to use it on my Macbook.
4,"It is a hidden gem. One of the best restaurant in Hamburg. Very high quality food with a creative touch, yet affordable. Prepair to wait for at least 30 min. to get a table."
3,"I was there during lunch time and had their edamame and two vegan maki sushis. The atmosphere is nice, the staff friendly and the food was delicious."
4,"From the moment we wandered into the back room where the stage was all set up like an old-fashioned living room complete with standard lamp and occassional table, I fell in love with Pony Bar. Friendly staff provided us with vegan-friendly sandwiches and delicious cocktails and coffees and we felt very much at home during our gig there. The venue is a little gem."
3,"The one and only place at Hamburg to celebrate Wiener Schnitzel. But, be aware : this place is still well known. So make a reservation!"
4,"I LOVED this place. But go early, because it gets packed and can be pretty hot and uncomfortable to get around in the tight spaces with all the things to see. Love how magical it is when the lights change from Day to Night and you can see the towns/ cities light up. You can spend quite a few hours here taking everything in, so plan accordingly. Wear comfy shoes and again, go early!!"
4,"Hands down the best price to food ratio in the city. All burgers are freshly made to order and they will make whatever crazy burger combinations you throw at them. It's possible to get a burger, fries, and a beer for under 10€. This is a great place to go if you looking to eat a good burger on a budget."
4,Very nice coffee and cakes. It's a tight squeeze in there and a popular place. The Japanese filtered coffees are too pricy but the normal coffees are yummy and worth it :)
4,"We ordered one appetizer which was grilled eggplant with garlic and one Bakhtiari. He eggplant dish was specifically wonderful. But also the Bakhtiari was not bad too. The best thing about this restaurant is however the ice cream and faludeh. He ice cream was probably made from saffron and rose petals along with pistachio slices in it. One of the best ice cream i have ever tasted in my life. Also, the faludeh tasted good too"
4,"If you like fine cocktails, a great variety of Whiskeys and a lot of other good beverages, this is the place for you. This bar has a touch of luxury and class, people do like to dress up when they come here. They also offer snacks, if you'd become hungry after the 3rd to 5th drink :)The staff is working in a pro-manner and is really friendly. I recommend reserving a table at the Bacardi Lounge."
4,"Ein super tolles Event, kann ich nur empfehlen!! macht spaß und man lernt sich besser im dunkeln zu verständigen."
4,"Best Döner in Town! The service is great, always smiling faces, delicious meat and chicken döner, big portions.Döner Tüte is highly recommended!;)They have also great snacks like börek..."
1,"The view is great - and that's basically it. Knowing this location for several years now, one must say that the quality decreased over time. Nowadays the cocktails are too pricy for their quality (for example Boilerman, Le Lion Bar de Paris are better options). On top the service is slow and needs to be constantly reminded of previous orders."
4,Lot of ppl waiting to get in. Got a seat after 20min without a reservation. The food was great and well priced. Liked the Red sake mojito!
0,"Confirmed yelp reservation was not accepted upon arrival.  Staff ""tried to call"", apparently absolving them from their commitment.  Argumentative rather than apologetic.  Not okay."
2,"If you want to have a quiet night out, and you are a fan of good service, then DO NOT under any circumstances go there on a thursday.On thursdays Sausalitos is a night club, packed with people (in suits surprisingly) who are there for the after work party. Any other day of the week should be rather normal.It claims to be mexican, but well its not - not really, no.But the food is nonetheless good.They have a wide choice and huge portions for acceptable prices.The have a wide choice of cocktails. I like the place.For eating everyday except thursdaysfor partying on thursday night"
4,The restaurant has the original Vietnamese ambient very nice. The food is authentic. Will be back for sure
3,"High quality, delicious meat and sides. I ordered the rinderbraten oder (salted beef) with gravy, red cabbage, and krout. Each plate (you can choose large or normal sized) come with two sides. The choices are side salad, mashed or diced potatoes, red cabbage, and krout.The red cabbage and krout were sweeter than most I've tried. I particularly enjoyed the krout and was told it's both ""sour and sweet"" krout. There are also three types of mustard: süß (meaning sweet, seemed like a honey mustard), and scharf (meaning sharp, very strong) and mittel-scharf (meaning medium-sharp, still very strong)."
1,"This bar is prety hit and miss and there was a line to get in last night which seemed a bit silly as it""s OK but not all that. I've had some great nights here when the weather was warmer first arriving in Hamburg and I've had some lame nights here too. Over-crowded full of American guys trying to hit on my friends and annoying us, the music being pure cheese at best. Plus side the bartenders are friendly and I've got free shots and drinks here before."
4,"I always thought of this place like a ""burger place"". Today I've tried chicken wings. What can I say? You just cannot go wrong with both. Make sure you get beer in 1L jugs."
3,A very small place with some great fish dishes. I had the classic fish and chips which was very well done. The tartare sauce with the fish was delicious and made the fish taste even better.The chips were not great but not bad either. Recommended if you're a hard core fish fan.
4,"Yelp didn't let us down on our trip to Hamburg, I had read about this place before and was looking forward to trying and I wasn't disappointed! All the tables come with individual tablets to pop up in the middle of table which makes ordering easy especially when your German is less than wunderbar! You select your burger/pulled meat and the type of bun you want and a side. I opted for pulled pork in a sesame bun with amazing thin sliced potatoes. It was delicious! The food was fresh, fast and used good ingredients. The staff were great and this place kicked off a great trip."
4,"Great spot for dim sum in Hamburg! Tried lots of different dishes and enjoyed them all. Tasty and authentic Chinese food in the heart of Hamburg close to the Hauptbahnhof. Some of the food can take a while but it's worth the wait! FYI - They don't take reservations, so you just have to try your luck."
4,"Hard to believe, but Altona and Hamburg were two rivals. Now Altona is part of Hamburg (a nice, charismatic part), but I guess there still was a need to have its own museum. And I must say, well done guys! Small, but very informative museum, revolving around Elbe and everything which comes with it: shipbuilding, whaling(thank God it's in the past), fishery, sea trade, port and so on. A message is clear: the river is a key to regions past and the future. There's a beautiful collection of figureheads occupying the whole room. Also a hall dedicated to Schleswig-Holstein, Helgoland island in particular. This museum is very similar to  surprise Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (Hamburg Museum), but smaller. It has a few things, which its bigger brother doesn't have: the whole interactive section dedicated to kids - Kinderolymp and a restaurant, Vierländer Kater, a house in the house, replicating typical Northen German tavern of 18th century. The restaurant itself worth visiting, great concept!"
4,"A lot of Asian food in Germany is ""verdeutscht"" as is a significant amount of Asian food Americanized in the States. But coming from NY, you get such a wide array of pretty authentic Asian dishes. Bok avoids becoming like the throngs of fast food noodle joints in Hamburg and offers up some of the best Asian food, I think, you'll get in Hamburg."
4,"delicious! good service with fast serving food. the menu changes everyday. limited choices but that also means, they perfected those dishes. only downside is, they do not open during the weekend and it closes fairly early in the evening."
2,"Had a quick lunch in this Portuguese quarter near the clock tour on Sunday. Pleasantly surprised I must say. There are so many restaurants at this corner it's a bit confusing as to where to go. The lunch plates were about 15 euros each, and we had two entrees among the three of us. One was grilled squid plate, which was excellent, and the other was what seemed to be white fish fillets cooked in tomato cream sauce. The latter is also decent and gets three stars. The service was not outstanding but was acceptable. Clean bathrooms. Can't complain and did not regret going."
3,"many pros: good but inexpensive food, casual but stylish setting, busy but friendly waiters I can just sit comfortably at the bar by myself, eat my dinner, observe the kitchen and people around and feel good. cons: parma ham should be served ONLY as a cold cuts, it is so damn salty when grilled in pannini! Can we make it some sort of rule in every cooking book? Thanx!"
3,"A very cool place in Hamburg Schanze. The burgers are excellent (150g patties). We came free to eat at 19:30 and had a small choice of tables, the place was fully booked. The potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent side order the the fantastic burger (No choice of a bun but that is okay for me).Only thing is when you go downstairs to visit the toilet you must know that is an old house. Nothing more to say."
4,"Everything was authentic- the service, food and atmosphere! Would highly recommend. We got both the tikka masala and butter chicken, which were cooked perfectly"
3,"I don't come to Germany for the coffee.  But I stopped by nord coast after hearing about it from a friend and was pleasantly surprised.They make both light roast and dark roast espresso.  I was surprised by this, and inquired with the owner as to why, and he responded that most Germans do not drink anything other than dark roast.  Him and I wink at each other and acknowledge that light roast is where all the flavor and complexity is really at.  I know German culture takes time to adapt.  GERMAN PEOPLE IF YOU'RE READING THIS -- try the light roast it will not harm you.The food is great.  My favorite breakfast I've had so far is the poached egg with pesto, pomegranate, and spinach.  The waffles are pretty good too, with fruit and whipped cream.If you've tried the espresso, then it's worth trying the coffee.  They've got some preparation techniques that are uniquely German (I forget the name but ask one of the folks working there).  I tried one and it was really good.Other highlights: the place is on the canal and has a nice view.  In addition, they are pretty chill so you might wait for your coffee sometimes.  I pestered the staff with a ton of questions and they were nice enough to answer all of them!"
3,"The Hamburg Dungeon is an interactive journey through the dark history of Hamburg, with actors explaining about e.g. Black Death, the great fire or pirate Störtebeker. Within groups you enter room by room, where the actors wait for you. Everything is a little spooky and therefore there is a minimum age of 10 years old to enter the Dungeon. Enjoy!"
4,"A 5-star Flat White was what I was after...And a 5-star Flat White is what I got. An esteemed colleague of mine suggest Public Coffee Roasters as a (much needed) departure from chains Starbucks, Balzac, etc. She was undeniably correct, Public Coffee Roasters was a nice walk for us (fresh air!) and ended up being lovely (fresh coffee!). The guy behind the counter was very courteous and made that flat white with an expert touch. Upon delivering it to our table he even apologized for the (nonexistent!) delay. It's a chill spot with a few tables, comfortable vibe, nice music, friendly staff and great coffee. Hits all the notes for me."
4,"Snacking might be tricky when you are trying to achieve your fitness goals. I finally stumbled upon the perfect option for whenever I want to cheat a little on my diet. This is by far my ultimate favorite relatively healthy snack in the world and I find excuses out of anything to go there and enjoy either a quarkbecher, a shake or frozen Quark.This time I had the ""Fit Macher"" which has sugar free Quark, fruits and Müsli. But I do recommend you try their more exotic flavors such as Detox Kelch with kale and chia or the ""Warm Up"". In Terms of location, don´t expect some fancy trendy Café or anything like that. It is really just a booth, but their product is amazing so don´t let that disuade you from trying it out. Also sometimes you can find them on Food markets or events around Hamburg. Just Keep your eyes open. You got to try them all!Mucho love,D."
4,"Think of Mc Donalds or Burger King and then think better quality. JB's is a fantastic burger bar in Barmbek. It's a bit of a walk from U S Barmbek and situated underneath Block House.JB's and Block House are tied together business wise or were. Someone told me about that but I forget the full story.The burgers are a big sized and packed full of tasty stuff ranging from fried mushrooms, bacon, cheese. All with a good dash of salad. Plus frieds or garlic bread on the side.Insider tip: Try the garlic bread!! It's the same as Block House. So incredibly tasty!The restaurant is nicely sized with kids area. It's also well kept and maintained. Staff service is also pretty good. But expect a queue around 6pm when everyone decides they can't be bothered to cook."
4,"We lived in Hamburg for two years, and I think I ate at Jimmy Elsass no fewer than 100 times. A real locals kinda vibe, it's a great spot to bring your visiting friends. The atmosphere is perfection. The flamkuchen, and this cannot be overstated, is mind blowing. I have been back in California for 5 years and I still dream about Jimmy Elsass."
4,"Finally, I am glad that provide Vietnamese coffee yay! Hard to find Vietnamese larger in Hamburg, Germany!"
3,"Small and cozy place with a lot of great food. We went there for late breakfast. The pancake with blueberries are amazing. The homefries they serve are also amazing. And everything there is vegetarian, most things even vegan. The vegan bacon was really good."
3,Öld style Environment with well built antique! Little bit expensive but quality ! Bre
2,"I only used to hang out with folks who would only go to Zoe II, then I tried Zoe III and I'm sorrybut they are exactly the same thing. Design, couches, bar, etc. Maybe I'm not a regular enough to appreciate the Sofabar rivalry going on in Hamburgbut really folks, it's the SAME bar just on opposite sides of the street. I'm usually pretty happy when I can just find a bench outside and some shade. Chill out spot, nice patio set a bit back from the street, good spot for a drink or two."
3,A very popular location for dinner on a Tuesday evening - which was a good sign for us as we only had one night to eat dinner in Hamburg. Food service was quick and the food was authentic and tasty. If you want German food in a picturesque river setting and a very comfortable relaxed atmosphere this would definitely be a good choice!
3,"The service was not great...we got there and just stood waiting to be acknowledged for about 15 minutes. They were super busy and finally someone came to take our names down. The seating is uncomfortably close to your neighbor, hardly any personal space. The only good thing was the food."
3,"A pretty cool place near the Schanze. Your typical bar/lounge concept with some interesting design concepts. Without going into details others have already written about, notable is that the crowd tends to be in their twenties (college kids), half the people stand out front so they can smoke and the bartenders tend to be quite nice (rare in Hamburg bars). The chick with half her breasts tattooed is totally cool and the Asian guy is always helpful. There's also a small room downstairs which I found a bit claustrophobic.this is totally skip-able. Definitely worth checking out though as it's one of the morein places when it comes to the Schanze."
4,it was GREAT! There is no Menü. You get a three course meal of Fish and Shrimps. what ever the boss bought on the Fish market fir the Day. The Boss cooks himself. If you like Fish you have to visit this Place.
4,"Came here after a long walk around the city.  I sat outside on the picnic tables and ordered the seasonal special... a hamburger patty with white asparagus, potatoes and a big boat of hollandaise.  The best hollandaise I've ever had.  The meal was delicious.  Very friendly people that come here and the locals chatted me up even though I was a tourist.  Hamburg is great"
2,"Das neue Innen-Design ist cool und modern, ähnelt stark Starbucks. Leider gibt es hier nicht mehr die hintere Sitzecke, in der man sich etwas zurückgezogener unterhalten konnte. Sehr schön finde ich immer die Blumen-Arrangements auf den Tischen! Der Lärmpegel ist wie eh und jeh sehr laut.  Die verschiedenen Kaffee-Spezialitäten (Caramellj, Vanilla Latte etc.) schmecken für mich alle gleich, dafür sind die Baguettes und Surf-Cup-Nudeln sehr lecker!  Für einen kleinen Zwischenstopp zum Füße ausruhen eine gute Wahl mitten in der City."
1,"I definitely see the appeal here. I feel like it's more for the masses...think McDonald's, German style. And actually the burgers and fries do very much taste similar to that of McDonald's, in my opinion anyway. Even the advertising is in line with that of McDonald's as they advertise huge massive burgers, but in reality you get a thin, perfectly cylindrical and over-seasoned hamburger patty, flat mass-produced buns and misc. toppings...but at least it tastes pretty good. Again...think McDonald's but at twice or three times the price wherever you come from.If you are a visitor of Hamburg, please do not believe those that say it's the best in our city! There are many more better offerings in Hamburg.  Overall, 2.5 stars. Will you ever see me there again? Not if it's my choice. I won't deny that I thought it was pretty good, but I was disappointed overall. If anything really, it has seriously deterred me from wanting to try Block House."
4,"Wow! That's all I can say- this place was phenomenal! The ambiance, the staff and the food- OMG the food! Some of the best and freshest Sushi I have ever had. The ambiance of the place is fantastic- load but not too much, the staff great and watching the chefs cook in open kitchen helped make a great meal even better. 3 of us ate a literal boatload of Sushi and had a very nice bottle of wine, and it was only €50 a head."
1,The bar is situated in the heart of eimsbüttel. The interior is nice and cosy with lovely vintage sofas. Unfortunately we were disappointed by the cocktails. We had a Gin Fizz which quite frankly had no fizz and a Mojito which was nothing more than ok. I do hope that the coffees served are nicer as it's a lovely little place.
2,Good cocktails. good food. happy hour. service could be better.
3,"Had to wait a while as it was super busy, but once we bit into our burgers, it all made sense. The meat was the finest we've tasted in a burger, ever, period. Chips nothing to write home about."
3,An unusual style with a surprise menu. Just tell them what you really cannot eat and they will create something for you. quite a small place so booking is adviseable and at weekends absolutely necessary - its even possible to have a 2 or 3 week waiting list for a weekend booking.
4,"thank you, international Yelpers... this place is so 5-star i desperately wish it was in my 'hood back in L.A. CA USA.  it's everything one would want in a neighbourhood spot:  -so friendly...the first time we were there, one of the workers asked if we were new to the area, and when he found out we were just tourists from America, he really went out of his way to answer all our questions about Hamburg. -so cozy. there are two rooms, both with comfy couches, and tables and chairs.  there's a big covered patio out front, with a dog bowl for thirsty pups.  there's even a basket of books for kids! -so delicious.  they've got great chai lattes and good coffee.  the pastries are fresh and there's a good selection of German classics.  they make a nice quiche plate that comes with salad too.  everything's plated really nicely.we came here as much a possible during our stay and really loved our relaxed afternoons there, people-watching while sipping a delicious drink with yummy eats. it's really the perfect incarnation of a local cafe/coffee spot."
0,"I don't know if it was because we ate there late on Valentine's Day and the chef was just fed up or something, but we had a *terrible* experience here. The restaurant was freezing cold.The food took a very long time to come out, despite it being a menu fixe.Every dish was overcooked except the dessert, which was completely uninspired. The food was pretty expensive for what it was. The decor was unimpressive and there is no decent view, which is too bad for a restaurant so close to the water. I really cannot recommend it."
3,"Luigis is a quite nice italian restaurant in the quater Neustadt, also calles portuguese quater. The pizzas are like the pizzas in Italy. The pizza toppings are from very good quality and the various daily menu offers always nice new and traditional pizzas. The pasta is also original italian style.The pizzas are big and crispy. Their quality is excellent and you will not find easy a pizza backery like this in Hamburg.If you want to visit Luigis at the evening, you should better have an reservation. Its always difficult to get a table at the evenings. I can only give this restaurant five stars because of the staff. The staff is italian, but they are always a little bit craggy. But the service is fast and good.I recommend this restaurant for a quick but good lunch or dinner for families and groups, but not for a rendevous."
4,"I found this roastery yesterday, led by my nose when I was in the vicinity. The roaster gave me a personal tour of the facilities and I had a very good (and amazingly inexpensive; all drinks are 1,- EUR) Capuccino in the café in the upper floor."
3,"Good place to get lunch! They seem to have three different meals to select from (not sure if threee different every day) and it's really affordable (3,90 EUR for a ""regular""). Tall costs a bit more, but I am not sure if you need that - I felt stuffed. :) Usually Indian places in Germany don't season the food very much, but this place is different. Pretty nice, especially since this is not a ""real"" restaurant, but a fast food joint."
3,"This place is right around the corner from the Hauptbanhnhof and well worth a visit. It has a patio and limited seating inside but it was pretty empty when I got there and it was a Saturday afternoon. Service was perfect - they greeted me and sat me down right away and came only when I needed them. The menu is a fusion on Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai...I opted mainly for Thai. I asked for my noodle dish to be spicy, and I got what I ordered. Everything was made fresh and tasted delicious though I'm wary of restaurants that do different cuisines. I had my first Viet coffee and it was great even though I drank it incorrectly. Prices were average for this type of fare and food similar to what you could get in centrum without the huge crowds. I'd definitely come back if I'm in town again!"
3,"Top meat, a bit cold (big doors that don't isolete) and friendly service.Not seat next to the door downstairs if you don't want to freeze!"
1,"The food is very disappointing but the service is great!! This place is decorated really well and as soon as you walk in you feel like you're over at someone's home. They have cute couches, coffee tables and dining room tables everywhere. There even is a cabinet with children's books. So overall it looks perfect! The staff was really friendly but where it all went wrong was the food. I ordered the couscous salad and what I got is a massive plate with one small scoop of couscous which was in ball shape and two leaves on top of the couscous. I was expecting a salad, since they advertised it and two leaves of lettuce do not make a salad. The couscous was SO small it was barely enough to feed a small child. The couscous tasted a little bit crunchy and they definitely overdid it with the oil, it was leaking in oil. Food deserves one star but the fact the restaurant looked cute I bumped it up to two stars."
3,"The best burger I have ever had in the Europe thus far. As an American, I'm pretty picky on my burgers - I love them, and I've only been scarred by my experiments in Europe with burgers. When visiting...Hamburg, my friend and I thought it'd be fitting to have...a hamburger, in Hamburg. An acquaintance recommended this place, and they were right - it was great. The atmosphere is like a hip Mexican hipster cantina, despite no Mexican food. There are old punk records over the bar and really friendly bartenders. We didn't have a reservation, so we had to sit at the bar, which was fine. We each had beers and I had a burger (something Texan) with an egg on it (I love eggs on anything) and my friend had a cheeseburger. The burgers themselves are HUGE, and were perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. They fell apart and were very juicy. The weirdest thing is that the burgers come on *English muffins*. I had experienced that before with a good burger in Seattle at brunch recently, but..it was a bit odd. I think the burger would have held together a bit better with a sturdier bun, but, it makes the place unique. I'll surely revisit this place when craving a burger in Hamburg again. Delicious!!"
3,"We found the restaurant on Yelp, of course.     We are 3 Germans, 1 Ecuadorian and 1 from the US. (Yes, it's Election Day but I voted early.).  Three of the pastas were excellent; 2 were good.  (The pumpkin ravioli was amazing.). The wine was very good-- we had red and white. The Tiramisu was excellent and the créame caramel was nice."
3,"I came here with some friends over the weekend and had some pretty awesome food. I ordered the Big Caesar which is a large caesar salad with a side of rib eye steak. My steak was grilled to medium rare perfection and perfectly salted. I was really impressed with it. I paid 15 euros for it which is reasonable. Although I did not order a hamburger, I can attest to their mammoth sizes. They also came with twice fried fries which I happily ate off my buddies plates. It's definitely a place you want to make a reservation for as it got pretty crowded on a Saturday night. The only downside was that our food took a long time to come. Other than that, I'll most likely try out the steaks next time."
4,"These cupcakes are absolutely fantastic. Even though I had them growing up as a child, they never tasted like these. The cake itself is very moist and the topping (icing/frosting) extremely smooth and creamy. I can really recommend them. EUR2,50 each is a bit much, but seeing that they're hand made and absolutely delicious - well, life is short and as they say, we're not here for a long time, but for a good time.Thanks for making my day, Happy Kappy. I'll be back..!"
4,"A great value Syrian (I think!) lunch venue in Aldstadt. Don't expect to get served within 20 minutes and get back to work, but if you want a decent sit down session come Friday, you can't go far wrong."
0,We have waited for one hour to finally get our food :( They gave too many excuses. The food is also NOT satisfied!
3,"Are there any beach clubs in the UK? By way of explanation, a beach club is an outdoor bar with a layer of sand across the floor to make it like a beach. Most of these bars are next to rivers or lakes, but not always. Anyway Strand Pauli is the most permanent and generally the closest beach club to the Reeperbahn. The pluses are that the atmosphere is always cool, the seating is good and the view is interesting (so long as you like shipping). The main minus is that the sand is dirty and full of cigarette butts. The beer is kinda expensive, but cheaper than the other beach clubs."
4,"As a big fan of all things Middle Eastern, I can appreciate good falafel. The food served at Falafel Haus is simply great; nothing chewy or dry, like in those drunk-food döner places. The falafel is freshly fried, their hummus is delicious, the prices more than fair, and the service is friendly and quick.I would highly recommend it as the best falafel I've had in Europe!"
4,"I can't say enough about this place! We had lunch there yesterday and had to go back again today!  The waiters were super friendly and spoke multiple languages. Our waiter spoke German, Italian, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The food is seriously better than a lot of the food I had in Italy!  The bruschetta, burrata, and the pizza with prosciutto and parmigiano was amazing!  They do have some funky dishes that were equally delicious if you like that sort of thing. It is very small and a bit dark inside. Sitting outside is definitely the best, but it does get packed. I would recommend going at like 12 for lunch or 6 for dinner to beat the crowds.  If you want Italian in Hamburg, this is the place to go!!"
1,"Two stars for the mouse I saw after finishing my meal. But then again I saw two big rats in a trendy restaurant in Paris!For starters the soup was delicious, disappointed with main course as I ordered fish that turned out to cold served (not mentioned on the menu), very oily potatoes, some cream on the fish. I just had the fish and salad. The fish wasn't bad after accepting the facts. p.s. look for the fish in the fish"
3,"This is a great date location with its hip atmosphere and attractive (and competent!) servers.  The food is aesthetically pleasing, varied and of a good quality.  If you have a larger group though, the volume due to its high ceilings can be a bit overwhelming and the price is quite high though understandable for its location.  All in all, a great place to eat when you're in the area!"
2,Great space; pieces are great including the two Lagerfeld dresses when you enter the museum.  I found an elevator but I don't think it was listed on the map.Restaurant wasn't too bad and the price was great.  The museum store is pretty much what you'd find in any other museum.
4,"We could not believe how much delicious food we received for such a low price. Seriously, some of the most flavorful curry I've had. We had curry chicken, butter chicken, Palma paneer, and vegetable Sampras.  Order at counter and buzzer when food  is ready, but so delicious!"
3,"Since I normally don't enjoy the kind of Chinese food you get served throughout Germany (keywords: heartburn or glutamate) this place here is a positive exception.Starting off with the amazing cleanliness of tablecloth and furniture: No sauce spots or spilt soy sauce like one is often used to. Besides staff here are friendly and stunningly quick. Their menu consists of different (regional) Chinese specialities, however, prepared differently. Maybe in an affectionate way - or just made with real expertise. Prawns, fish, meat and veg all just close to being perfect: veg being al dente, the meat tender, the seabream crispy and the sauces very well/naturally flavoured. The food is different from the usual Chinese stuff in 2 ways:the creative recipes and the meals' way of presentation. Beautiful! And if you are into the crazy-shaped, carved carrots that suddenly have turned into swans, a pagoda or a whatever bird then this is paradise for you. So prices are obvisouly quite a bit higher than the Chinese take-away's around the corner but it's definitely worth the way over to this spacious restaurant. Recommended!"
3,"Delicious food, quick service. Nice selection of soups and salads. Great lunch spot, although you might find it hard to get a seat, takeaway is fine with a nice spot by the river to eat nearby.Always busy, with queues out the door."
4,I really love this place so much! Not only is the food really fresh and well done but also very creative.I had their large mushroom bowl with silk tofu and holy moly! As a person with Vietnamese background I can tell you that this dish was very refreshing and new for me! Service has been amazing and the interior is what I consider very contemporary for vietnamese restuarants: atmospheric and aspiring to re-create the streetfood vibe in Vietnam.
4,Exquisite service! Super interior. Love their salted popcorn as nice welcome. Had sushi at this place and loved it! Also tried their sweet potato fries with guac but the guac was a bit too watery for my taste. All in all a really nice place to stop by after shopping. Thumbs up for the great staff!
2,"This Schanzenviertel brick icon is popular amongst everyone for their Hamburgers, meaning the food and also the local people, the spacious outdoor bench seating up on the hill next to the U3 and S Bahn stop, and the thick pommes (french fries)  that you dip in this flaky sea salt for flavor!  Mainly a lunch spot for me, but for dinner, it gets romantic, as there are soft candles glowing everywhere and a basic, but classy menu offering fish, meats, and pastas.  I had a wrapped baked fish once with steamed veggies and herbs that was not only healthy but had a nice wholesome flavor to it.  Portions are plentiful and prices are fair.The staff speaks limited English, because it really is more a local spot, but the chef here is famous and for such a reputation, the food is delicious and affordable. Now they have this outdoor grilling area for Kalbbratwurst or normal bratwurst and also for those tasty french fries we all love.  They make a relish mayo sauce or something with herb that gives it a slight yellow/green tone, but it tastes awesome with the fries and get some salt flakes also. It is some special sea salt that looks like light snow flakes, you can not order fries here without that!!!"
2,Charming restaurant on the Shanze. I had the Trucker schnitzel (featuring two fried eggs) and just about managed to finish it - very tasty. The decor of the old Apothecary adds a nice atmosphere and its particular warm and cosy in cold weather with the hot water pipes lining the edge of the room.
2,"After burgers me and my family took a vote: from 1-5, how many stars. So... 2 votes for 3 stars, 1 for 4, and since I was counting votes I got to be indecisive and go for 3,5 stars. Result is 3 stars. Best things first : meat quality seemed fine. Bun is symbolic, has to be there to give you an illusion of something else than meat overload. I got the classic burger and to me it was a bit heavy on the mustard. But otherwise real greasy like expected. And a s***load of fries. Never seen that many fries on one plate before. Actually kind of scary. A bit too much even.And then the bad: what is up with the acoustics in this place? It fills up pretty quickly after 6pm, and with the people comes the noise. And OMG we had to yell to have a conversation. It was almost impossible to hear what the others at the table said. Its ok with noise, but this was ridiculous. I would go there again if asked, but preferably with more beer and less conversation involved."
4,When in Hamburg- must try this Italian gem ;) the creamy pasta with truffles is the most delicious dish I've had! You can share small dinner portion with the veal fillet ... OUT OF THIS WORLD. The waiters are all very nice and helpful- Bon App!
0,"Consistently embarrassingly poor service. Definitely not recommended. Food was very good, but the servers/staff were so incredibly bad. It wasn't even worth it. I can forgive rushed service, but running around like crazed lunatics and throwing attitude doesn't fly. Very disappointing. Lame. Just plain stupid."
4,"Great burgers, nice staff, and plenty of outside seating protected from the rain."
4,"If you like great handmade pizza in 10 minutes, this is a place to check out. They have a creative weekly offering of different pizzas (even vegan and sweet options) are available. The staff is nice and the prices are fair for the central location."
2,"It was interesting to see an Asian buffet concept come to life in Hamburg.  In addition to a wide assortment of prepared foods at the buffet table, there is also station for ""live"" cooking where they will cook your assortment of fish, meats, and vegetables for you.  The buffet itself is mixed.  The sushi was pretty weak, with very thin slices of fish, but the quality seemed decent.  Chinese fare did better with the fried shrimp and stir fries being pretty good.  The hot and sour soup was also surprisingly good, and surprisingly spicy.  The grill portion is what you make of it.  The quality of the ingredients was good, and they do a simple stir fry with olive oil, so it's closer to a Japanese style teppan rather than a Mongolian grill.  Dessert selections were limited and spread out and included a few types of cakes, glazed bananas. and some fried sesame balls.Overall, Copperhouse is a decent Asian buffet in a nice setting.  With unlimited visits to the buffet and ""live"" cooking table, it is a good value especially for those with an appetite."
3,"I was hanging out with my freinds and suddenly saw this coffee shop in the another side of the street .The impression of me about it is the concept , which is minimal , bright and cute xD. As i went in , the smells of coffee beans rushed in my noé, so delightfully ! No complaint about the staffs , very gentle and friendly."
4,"Ham-Burgers in Hamburg Germany yes please! Especially if it here. This place has burger flavors to try more than once. Lunch time was a bit busy but rightfully so for good food.i chose the baked potato instead of fries and I'm glad I did. If anything I would just go for that and a burger on the side.  While I'm not a salad eater they do make them fresh right in front of you and the portion is large. And as delicious as they looked I would even eat one. Who doesn't want burgers and beer. Well you can get both here, enjoy a table outside and people watch as they pass in a hurry to get to their next destination.  My husband upgraded his champion burger and it was far better than my own. They also offer no bun options and a blue cheese burger that I heard was really good too.  What seems to be a chain restaurant or fast food was not like anything I'm use to in the US.  I would definitely go back. The cashiers were friendly and informative and offered a smile with every meal purchase. But don't expect fast food service if they are busy everything is made to order. But for me that is worth the wait."
3,"You can't get cheaper than free, and so it's hard to be anything less than happy with a visit to the Botanic Gardens in Planten und Blomen. It's great on a cold winter's day because everything is so nice and tropical in there - the heating costs must be enormous! However, unless you're massively into plants, then it's not that interesting. My favourite bits were the insect-eating plants, and the cactus room."
3,"Cozy coffeehouse near points of interest in Hamburg! The atmosphere was warm and bright, and the caramel macchiato was well worth the long wait.That was our only complaint; the shortage of servers made our wait very long, first to put in our order, and then even longer to get our drinks. At least it was a respite from the gray, rainy Saturday outside, and I would get another large caramel macchiato from them anytime! (Well, anytime that I have plenty of time to wait;).)"
4,"Easily the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Great views and convenient location centralized in Hamburg. Right in the water! Friendly service, a blend of Italian and French food. This was more of a tourist location than for the locals which easier to navigate and order. Nice place to rest your feet for a while and enjoy an excellent meal. Try the chicken sandwich!"
2,"This is a review for the museum cafe:Free parking. No wifi. Nice atmosphere. Very expensive macchiato which I was charged €2.80 for 200 ml. The average price in Hamburg is €2.30 for 400 ml, so to be charged this amount in one of Hamburg's poorest neighborhoods is out of order. If and only if the cafe's money supports the existence of the museum is this ok. This must be the reason this place is nearly empty at prime time (12:35 pm)."
4,"I'm from Hamburg and I think it was a lot of fun! I saw a lot of people complaining that they didn't understand much when they went there, because it was all in German. Well, I understand that the flyer is in English too, and if you'd do a little bit of research you""d know that they have English tours on Fridays and Saturdays at 10 am.I took my american boyfriend there and he said he had no problem understanding anything and that he loved it. I just wanted to give the tip that they do have english tours, and you can book the tickets online, they are cheaper and you wont have to wait in the cold or outside. When you know the right tricks you wont ever have to wait and it will be great! Also you always have to pay for pictures wherever you go, like in amusement parks, its just a thing to be expected"
3,"Relatively pricey, but excellent food - we had steak tartare (mediterranean + oriental style), ribeye on the bone and new york cut, topped off with a lemongrass sorbet with vodka. All awesome, though steak was not the best I've ever had (reserved, for now, for the Hix Oyster and Chop House in London!). Only downside was a degree of pretentiousness and mild obnoxiousness of other clientele - not really the restaurant/bar's problem (apart from the high volume of the mediocre techno dj) - all of the waiting/bar staff were excellent and appropriately attentive."
3,"This is the first time I have been in this restaurant,it is a Very nice persian enviromental restaurant,very good varities of meal and services with reasonable prices.sertainly I would recommend this restaurant to eat in."
3,I had Mezze for lunch and I was more than pleased with my choice. The taste and presentation were tops and the portions were pretty decent. Very cozy restaurant and very friendly staff. Tip: it could potentially have mote tables
0,"After a great experience the previous night at the excellent Hof Brauhaus we decided to give this place a try on Saturday night as it was just around the corner from my Mums hotel. I'd had lunch there before and thought it might be just the thing.What a huge disappointment! The service was friendly and helpful, but of the three main dishes we ordered were all well below par. The Wiener Schnitzel was burnt, my pork medallions were over cooked, the baked potato with chicken was likewise incinerated.I would never return there sad because it's in a great position!Beer lovers note: Although this place bills itself as a brewery, there seems little evidence of this taking place, although there are copper tanks in evidence. I tried a Dunkle and was very unimpressed."
4,"Love the ambience, nice n clean for local fine dining! Great food n wonderful service!"
3,"Really authentical. We wanted to have some good Indian food and we got it here! The food is great and people are nice. The place is not fancy but clean. If it is full you have to bring a little patience with you. The only negative point could be that at the end of the night you do not have so much choice, if the dish is over they do not do it anymore. At least you are sure that they prepare it fresh!"
3,"To be totally honest i don't come here to eat. I come for the beer!For the huge (1L) mass beer!And their pretzels! Lovely 'Oktoberfest themed' pub.I've been there only by night. on the week ends its always packed. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in a typical bavarian costums.There's also live music, typical german folkoric music, that i as a non-german dont know, but still dance to! It's a great place, especially if you're out of town or you have visitors."
3,"Katze is a cool new bar on the Schulterblatt. As you might guess from the name is a little bit cat-themed, but not much, because that would probably be rubbish. At the time of writing (6 November '08) this bar is so new that it still smells of wet varnish and paint, and the outside of the bar looks unfinished - there's no name for example. The bar staff are mostly young, attractive and blonde. The punters seem to be of a similar ilk, but maybe not quite as blonde. There are free bar snacks on every table, but they don't serve any hefeweizen. However they make up for this small oversight by serving Augustiner brau. It'll be interesting to see how this one develops, but things are looking good at the moment."
4,I ordered flat white and I must say that I've never before had such a good coffee. Might consider moving my home office here :-)
2,"Cute place for drinks and dinner!We sat inside immediately and started off with a glass of riesling and a cider as we reviewed the menu,Looks like this place is more popular for brunch as the pictures in yelp show an impressive brunch spread. The menu is mainly german fare. With a lot of noodle dishes. There was a tapas section and so we ordered the the baked cheese with honey to start. For our entrees, we ordered the noodles with turkey breast and mushroom sauce.The starter - was really good! The combo of sweet and savory for the baked cheese on bread was a great way to start our meal and I'd highly recommend it. The starter can be quite filling so I think it's best to share this with 4 people. We were only 2 so we were definitely stuffed after finished the starter and our mains. For our entrees, we received the cooked pieces of turkey breast with the mushroom sauce over it and had a bowl of noodles that came separately. They cooked a 2 person of noodles for us so that was nice. So you add the noodles with the turkey and mushroom sauce as you see fit. It was really good but very filling. I had to get a little to go box as I think the cheese and noodles filled me up! Next to pay, this was the first time we actually had to get up and pay in the front. We were waiting around for a while trying to get the attention of our waitress only to have her politely tell us we are suppose to pay in the front. We were more used to paying at our table but here just remember to pay in the front or you'll be waiting around for awhile.I'd come back to try the brunch and enjoy a beer or two!"
1,"Maybe it was because I was set on having an authentic California burrito experience that I was left so unsatisfied. I ordered the chicken burrito and knew what to expect in terms of presentation based on all the pictures on Yelp--wrapped in paper instead of foil and grilled. That's different, but no biggie. I was, for some reason, expecting to pick up the burrito and eat it like normal with my hands, but alas it was too overstuffed and soggy to do so. The mixture of the lettuce, rice, beans, and salsa tasted good, but the chicken lacked flavor. My hubby ordered the enchilada, which was a burrito smothered in mole sauce. The mole sauce was way too chocolatey, like milk chocolate was used in the sauce chocolatey.Yes, I know we live in Hamburg now and I shouldn't expect the same flavorful, meat and rice cooked in lard wrapped neatly in a heavenly package of greasy goodness...The place was quite crowded when we arrived but we were able to grab a booth in the corner. There is high turn over here, so you may only need to wait a little bit  for a free table. I did enjoy the luchadora theme decor. I don't think I'd come back any time soon, but if a hankering for a burrito or Mexican food  manages to overpower me, I'd give Jim Burrito another try."
2,"Turmbar is certainly unique. It's a little bar in an old water tower (?) thing. Walking to the bar seemingly takes forever, going round and round in circles. At the top there is a little bar that serves most of what you'd expect. The main problem is the slight lack of windows!"
2,I must admitting it's rare that I come across REALLY good Italian food. And this wasn't one of those rare times. The food wasn't that well prepared. And the pizzas were simply boring - tasting most of all a bit prefabricated.
3,"This place opened recently around the corner from me. I never really went in until a few weeks ago since it was always either closed or seemed closed because of how empty and sterile it looked. Finally managed to get myself to go here for dinner and was surprised at what a wonderful selection they had for vegetarians. Myself, I'm not a tofu fan, but if you are they've got tons of tofu options. I had a Quesadilla which was much too big for me to finish. The price was good and the service was super friendly - the guy at the counter took the time to explain what everything was. 4 stars because this is a good and solid all-around eatery. One star off for how sterile this place feels. I wish they'd up the decor a bit and make it feel a bit more warm and welcoming."
3,"Always busy, order and take a buzzer back to your table and wait 5 minutes. Collect your own utensils. No table service. The food is pretty good and for 6 Euros, a good deal. You could do a lot worse in the area.."
2,"Ho-Hum!! Standard fare. I experienced better...the wait staff is funny, sort of local Mafia wannabes (or maybe real...;-). If you watched the Sopranos you know what I mean...he..he...enjoy!"
3,"Update: So after now having been here a bunch of times, I remembered to come back and update this review. i almost forgot to do so but steak places have a special place in my heart. Long-story short, the place has come into its own. It's still a bit generic, hence only four instead of five stars. There is a bunch of new waitstaff so I guess they dumped people who were not up to par and have finally found people who'll stick around for a bit. We had great service again so happy on that front. I've basically only been here with guy friends (my g/f is just not into it) and everyone is always pleasantly surprised. Best bet is to come here when you want good food, are with a group and know everyone is going to drink. The outdoor area is as expected fun so definitely an option for outdoor seating. Food has remained consistent and really good. I know a bunch of people who've complained about things here but they must just hit my sense of taste. I always like the burgers, find the fries really good and the steaks with spinach are the best. This place remains an indulgence for every couple months and I'm glad they came to Hamburg. It seems like they'll stick around for a bit. With a heavy heart I am only going to give The Bird three stars at this point. I've often been to their location in Berlin and really am a big fan. The combination of great steaks and burgers, with a bit of a rockabilly atmosphere mixed in with attitude and grunginess familiar to Berlin excel at that location. I awaited patiently the opening of the Hamburg location which I received the scoop on pretty early (someone knew someone and so forth!) Anyway, the 30th of April opening night was in my calendar real early. So we went and unfortunately had too high an expectation. Don't get me wrong. The food is just as it is in Berlin. You either like it or you don't. I like it and the burgers in my opinion are awesome and the steaks are always exemplary and consistent (although I only had a burger last night......steak next time!)So why only the three stars? Well it could be because it was opening night and we will be back, so take these three stars as only preliminary for me. Anyway, some things were just off. The restaurant itself isn't ""done"". There's no real deco on the walls and it's too ""clean"". Actually with the funny painting/light ceiling thing in the middle of the restaurant area it looks like a Turkish bath renovated into a cheap Italian restaurant. Did they not get some kind of interior designer involved in this process? The lighting is off too. Granted, some lights were obviously broken but the lighting is crap. Screw the modern stuff.....throw some candles on the tables and make it a bit more intimate/moody/whatever. With the fluorescent ceiling fixtures, it's just wrong. The tables are too new and modern. Why didn't they just go out and buy up a bunch of old, beaten up benches or tables from an insolvency sale. There is so much more character in something like that and more so than this Ikea style suburban dining set set-up they have. Somehow this all has to ""age"" and get a bit beaten up before I'll truly accept it. We'll see how time changes this place and I hope they ""finish"" decorating because right now it seems clearly unfinished.Staff were super nice. We had the Brazilian guy and two girls (everyone speaks better English than German.....as in the Berlin location) and the girls all have tats. Anyway, super nice but not yet up to speed. You have to get them informed of how things were in Berlin. Your regulars are going to come expecting what they know from Berlin. Brazilian guy was almost too nice if you know what I mean. But, to counteract that, the one tattooed girl was super nice but smelled of sweat. I guess that balances things out. :-) At least someone was a bit ""grungy.On a positive note, after we finished eating we were offered shots with our bill. The crowd was a bit edgy (wonder if it stays like this). The dog from Berlin was wandering around the place which adds charm. The outdoor benches will be awesome in the summer months, just like sitting out front in Berlin is. There is a ton of potential here. I may be over critical and it was their first night but I'm willing to wait it out. I'll definitely be back and also with a group of guys instead of the missus. This is more of a place to go with a group of friends, throw back some meat and empty a couple pitchers. Not a date-night place so do keep that in mind.Long story short, I hope this isn't the American owners getting older and settled and reflecting that in their new Hamburg place. Stay true to who you were, grunge up the place a bit and make it the relaxed, rocker-edge hang-out with great food and drink that it wants to be."
0,"Is it even possible to provide slower service? I would't recommend stopping by there but there is not many places in the area for a coffee, so..."
4,"Thamers must be one of the oldest pubs in Hamburg, the bar looks positively ancient. The beer selection is interesting (they are the only bar that I've found to sell Duckstein Weizen) and the food looks great - I've only ever had the goulash soup and it was the best I've had in Hamburg. If there is one small problem, then it's that the bar is quite, er, small. Each time I've been I've managed to get the last table, but I've never been at what I would consider a peak time"
4,"Einfach TOLL !The food is great, the prices are really correct, the place is lovely and the service is perfect !Nothing to add but GO and enjoy :) !"
4,another treasure in the industrial West side on the way to the football stadium. great north German fare. try the rotbarsch filet. the bratkartoffeln is a bit too oily for my taste. also the fish soup! lots of chunky fish pieces and shrimps. wholesome food for the soul. lecker!
4,This was probably the best meal I ate during my two weeks in Germany! Everything was home made and there was so much attention to detail! I had spätzle with sauce and cheese and tried a dumpling with minced meat- both were outstanding! The staff were so kind and the English translated menu was perfect! I would absolutely recommend this place for an authentic German food experience!
4,"Germans are known around the world for their excellence in engineering and attention to detail, and nowhere is that more effectively on display than Miniature Wunderland. Every last bit of the models is breathtakingly designed, and each section is filled with hidden details and Easter eggs. Some highlights include:* The entire place has a day/night cycle, complete with sunsets, colored lights, and every last car, building, and street lamp lighting up in sync with the cycle.* There's a river in one of the areas that has a remote-controlled boat in it, complete with tides achieved by pumping water in and out of the river in sync with the day/night cycle.* The Hamburg airport has a perfect replica, complete with takeoffs, taxiing, landings, and a working departure/arrival board.* Each display is filled with buttons that cause rocket launches, open buildings, prompt volcanic eruptions, and more!* The roads are full of cars and trucks that actually move and obey traffic lights.You can easily spend hours here ogling over every detail. I lost count of the number of times I said ""wow"" out loud. If you're touring Hamburg, just go. You won't regret it, not even a little."
4,"Best burgers in Hamburg!! Cheesecake is also amazing. Huge portions if you order burgers with fries (I never finish it all, but you can order without fries) and a nice selection of drinks. Burgers have english muffin buns...otherwise authentic toppings (also made to suit your taste) and ""eat with your hands"" instructions on the menus :) Reserve seats for a weekend meal. Friendly atmosphere."
4,As a UNESCO World Heritage site the warehouse district shouldn't be missed. If you're anything like me and have a thing for bridges in architecture you'll be a happy camper. I love walking around and seen the locks on the bridges and the views down the canals. Read up on some of the history about the warehouse district and how it came to be a UNESCO heritage site. There's some great spots for pictures and just to get a nice walk in.
4,This place is amazing! Delicious German cuisine. We had the Spätzel with meatloaf and the Maultaschen with egg. We are going back on Sunday before we return to Copenhagen.
1,"We had the Lachs Waffel with the beetroot dip. It sounded good on the menu, but when it was served it was actually just a big waffel with a few pieces of smoked Lachs lying on top of it. Also the taste of the waffel was odd and the whole thing just didn't taste good. In addition, 6-7 euros is quite pricey for this type of dish. Overall the food was pretty disappointing, so I wouldn't recommend going there."
4,"If it's too warm outside, you will enjoy the different flavored ice-cream such as raspberry basil or strawberry kiwi. You can also choose between different sizes of ice scoops and decide to eat it in a cup or a cone. You can either take away or chill in this nice cosy space. The waiters are friendly and speak English very well."
3,"I went to Marseille several months ago as part of a work dinner with some colleagues. Since being diagnosed with celiac, it is always up to me to pick a restaurant, and I chose Marseille because there seemed to be relatively little with wheat in most of the dishes (focusing more on meat, fish, and vegetables). I asked when making the reservation if it might be possible to make something gluten free for someone with celiac, and they said that would be okay. However, I was surprised and impressed that when I arrived, they even had gluten free bread for me! The waitress was also very well-informed about the menu, even knowing that certain things like their polenta had been cross contaminated with wheat. Overall, I was very impressed by their care taken for a celiac diner, even though they do not advertise as being gluten free friendly specifically. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed in the taste of the Bouillabaisse I ordered. However, the service was so good that I would be happy to come back and try a different dish sometime."
4,"During the winter, I never come here, since it's not really on my way to anywhere and I guess has not really looked so appealing form the outside.But we came here on an impromptu sunny evening and it was really good. Now the warm evenings have arrived, there aren't many better places to while away an evening with friends on the Fleet Insel. Because it gets so busy in this area a lot of the other places seem rushed, too busy and more than a little unfriendly.We had very friendly service from our waitress who spoke English and German without a fuss and they let us stay for as long as we wanted even after they should have closed and gone home. We even were able to enjoy the piano player from the next door Steigenberger Hotel terrace!Very nice, great fun, good chilli and beer. If you are passing, on a nice sunny day or evening, it's highly recommended."
4,This place is great.  Fantastic fresh fish from four oceans.  We sat outside and were entertained by Franco.  I would highly recommend Casa Franco Caramba.
3,"Tasteful menu, craft beers, and bowling alley in the basementIf you like a modern international fare that focuses on German/European food I highly recommend the Freischwimmer.The restaurant comes with a sleek and dark design inside and a cozy beer garden outside. Plus, there is a fun two-lane bowling alley (ninepins) in the basement that you can rent before or after dinner!During my last visit with friends we had the 'calamaretti' (filled calamari), the EURO2016 Burger with cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola, the steak fritte and the Roast beef.Everything tasted great, and I would order it again, especially the calamaretti! However, the burger's toppings (cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola) could have been more.Besides a great menu, the drinks are great, as is the beer on tap and their craft beer selection as well.A nice finish for a fun evening with friends is the bowling alley! We had so much fun that we will be back for sure!+ tasteful diversified menu (changes monthly!)+ good drinks, wine and beer menu+ prompt service and fun hosts+ not very noisy for a restaurant+ cozy beer garden+ fun bowling alley in the basement+ metro train right next door Average entrée: EUR 18Credit cards accepted.Mon-Sun from 5pm"
1,Food is good but not the service- also charges over 2€ for a tiny glass of tap water. Does not take credit cards? What year is this?
3,"Cute place for a breakfast, lunch or dinner... Very friendly associates"
4,"it's sad that other people have had not the best experiences here. i can tell you though that it can't be because of the taste or quality of the food, because it's superb. Been there three times and it's some of the best currywurst you can find anywhere. I've tried both the vegan and traditional bio. both were equally good. also the fries are perfect and they don't charge extra for unlimited condiments (which makes sense because the food is slightly pricey)definitely worth it"
0,"The W O R S T fish I've had in Hamburg so far!I'll keep it simple stupid:1. The place reeks. 2. The quality of the fish is horrendous as it is frozen and flavourless. 3. Even the sides are not fresh and every bit of nutrition cooked out of them. They only got one star because the staff was friendly. However, I don't go to restaurants because the staff is friendly."
3,I had a very good dinner but because I arrived alone on Valentine's Day without a reservation I had to sit at the bar which I don't recommend unless you are very tall. It was uncomfortable with legs dangling for so long otherwise dinner of rib eye with shallot potatoes and spinach was excellent and they pour a fair sized glass of wine.
4,"Excellent seafood with very affordable price, cannot ask for more! But mind the steps if you're traveling with difficult mobility."
4,"This is perhaps one of the most German things that you can see. The attention to detail is incredible, and the scale is a sprawling reconstruction of various parts of the world that spans two floors and is still growing. The lights actually change color on a timer to create a night and day cycle, and the cycle moves through the rooms as though the sun is moving across the sky. It's all connected! There are hidden jokes and details everywhere. A flying saucer comes down in one spot during the night for an abduction. There is a corpse in the river in another with a coroner parked nearby. Still, definitely great for kids or adults. The sets are interactive, with buttons throughout to trigger events. Very fun, took about two hours."
0,"Chocoversum is a chocolate museum and not a factory; tours are only available in German and with that said, be prepared to get lost in translation if unable to speak the language. Regular price is 14€ but cheaper with a student discount. Lockers are available for a 1€.I have read a review under trip advisor about ""unlimited chocolate sampling"" and it's not samples of the good chocolate we would expect, it's the chocolate that comes from the cacao ""seed"" (look at photos); which is very bitter.  Tour covers location of cacao plants, where its grown, the process of making chocolate, etc, etc. Tourists will be able to decorate their own chocolate bar and will be distributed at the end of the tour. The chocolate store is also available right as soon as you exit the.Being in Germany where chocolate is an all-time fave, I had high expectations for this place. Although the milk chocolate bar was great, I have expected more; c'mon, it's a chocolate museum! In conclusion, Chocoversum was pretty disappointing and not worth visiting in my opinion."
3,"Delicious burgers and amazing cheesecake. They weren't really lying when they advertise the cheesecake as being the best in the world. Oh, and some pretty good beer here too.When it's crowded you can expect to wait quite awhile to get your food (like almost an hour...so it's best to be in good company and feel like drinking a couple of beers), but when it's not you'll receive your food in a reasonable amount of time.We've tried a number of burgers here, The Rock (my fav so far), the Filthy Harry, Da Woiks, The Jack (which has blue cheese dressing(?)), and the Dr. Zian. All of the burgers are served on toasted English muffins and the meat patties are juicy, flavorful, and as big as a baseball! The burgers are also served with a generous amount of tasty fries.My rules to adhere to when dining here: if it's too crowded then leave (unless you don't mind waiting a long time to get your food), but if it's not too bad and you can easily find a seat, then you should really dine here."
4,You want to eat great steak/food? Go here. I visited the Delta Bistro twice already and each night was an awesome experience. Try the tomahawk steak (800g). 60 Eur for that gorgeous piece of meat but it's worth every cent! The service is quick and friendly. 5 stars well deserved!
4,"Handy location, homey atmosphere and decent service! I ordered Scholle Finkenwerder Art mit Bratkartoffeln und Salat, which is whole fried plaice (""Finkenwerder style) served with roast potatoes and salad. My boyfriend ordered Labskaus, which is an old, traditional sea farer's dish made from potatoes, beef and beetroot, served with gherkin, beetroot and rollmop. (It is completely gluten free!) We had Zabaione (warm marsalacreme) as the desert. All the food are tasty and well prepared. Very nice place to go if u r searching for northern German taste/gluten free restaurant!"
4,"Food is great, taste good, but not authentic. The service puts it over the top, you can't find good service like this anywhere outside of the US. The service here is even better than the US Vietnamese restaurants."
4,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant while exploring Hamburg on our vacation from the US. My boyfriend is vegan, so food options can be very limited. Piccolo Paradiso could not have been a more perfect place to enjoy an early dinner. We sat on the patio, which was peaceful, with a nice cool breeze. Our waiter was incredibly kind and helpful, since neither of us speak German. He went over the entire menu with us, in English. We decided on a vegan antipasti/tapas platter, as well as a dessert to share. It was the best mixed plate of food I've ever had - vegan or otherwise. The compilation of different flavors from different regions and countries was absolutely divine. We savored every bite. The limonade was delightful as well. We tried the rose water as well as the raspberry, and they were both refreshing, cool, and crisp. Dessert was decadent - chocolate creme brulee that was to die for. Favorite meal we've had in a very, very long time. Best in Hamburg, for sure! We recommend it, 100%."
0,"The food was good - the service appalling. The server made extremely intrusive and inappropriate comments to my face about my breasts and figure, several times, invited another waiting customer to comment on them, and then called over another worker to share in this frankly appalling objectification of a paying customer and human being. Would never recommend this establishment to any woman who doesn't want to risk being hit on and objectified, and trapped in an extremely uncomfortable situation while your food is in the process of being made Overall - disgusting treatment of female customers, left me feeling revolted and uncomfortable."
4,This is one of very few specialist coffee shops in Hamburg and they do a perfect job.... Their 'First Love' espresso is prob the best origin blend espresso I've tasted
4,Great Location when the weather is Bad! :)You should come early in the morning or 2 hours befor they close the exebition! Otherwise it will be maybe overcrowded
3,"Great source for Hamburg's bestest chips. And I hear their Currywurst is much appreciated by the carnivores, too.I can only rate their Grillgold (chips) which is excellent. Tomato sauce, mayonnaise and vinegar are splashed out for free. Nice! Prices are generally okay seeing that they sell e.g. organic Wurst. :)The grill master can be a little slow indeed but has as yet never been unfriendly.Schmitt's is always a good place of refuge before the drinking starts - or after the drinking has been done.I have heard rumours of people who came in twice on one single night Addictive so! ;)"
4,"I was there for dinner yesterday evening: a warm atmosphere, a friendly and fast service, typical French meals, excellent quality and very tasteful food! All that for a price that is easily affordable (33€ the 3 course menu).I didn't ate so well since a long time and I can only recommend this restaurant! Advice: reserve a table to be sure to get a place."
4,"Great place to sit outside when the weather is nice;  quiet, casual neighborhood vibe.  The flammkuchen here, is the bomb.  So light it practically floats on air; the balance of ingredients is deft, as it has to be with flammkuchen:  enough flavor to enchant, while not overwhelming.  Top drawer."
3,"Happy hour EUR5 cocktails until 9pm. EUR3.50 Augustiner Brau. Cool interior, good central Altona location. It does have a bit of a problem with very awkwardly sized and positioned tables, but otherwise it's a cool bar."
4,mr t burger changed my life! chipotle chilli sauce is digusting but every taste is different. the portion of sweet potatoe fries is too small for 4 EUR. overall its one of the best burger i had so far. thanks mates!
3,"They sell Augustiner and good, cheap (before 10pm) cocktails. One problem seems to be that it gets a little too packed. We got there as early as 8pm (very early for a Friday night out in Hamburg) and even then we only managed to get half of the last table in the place. By the time we left, two hours later, it was so packed that you literally had to push people out of the way to get anywhere. Like a mosh-pit."
2,This is an OK bar which tends towards stylish. Fairly dark and modern atmosphere. Still fills up at times with a pretty local crowd. Prices are OK. Bartending is average. You can sit outside in the summer and people watch pretty well. Only problem I have with this place is that at times at draws exactly the crowd you would try to avoid in Ottensen. Not typical though and always a good default place for a couple of drinks. I used to really like the Hollywood Canteen which used to be at this location prior to Reh Bar opening up. Unfortunately that place went downhill after moving. I guess then Reh Bar is a better alternative.
4,"Spell binding and stunning, Hamburg's Art Museum (Kunsthalle) has all the golden greats, plus plenty of modern allsorts.Placed between the lake, the old town and the Station, it's easy to reach and suitably priced and really is a must see during any visit to Hamburg."
3,"I heard its owned by the owner of gold fisch glass! I wasn't surprised, almost same crowd. It was semi-full on tuesday evening.You can either sit inside or outsideBeer isn't expensive 2EUR20 for a becks (if i am not mistaken)Good place for a drink on week night."
4,"Pauli pizza is like an institution in St. Pauli. You get to be creative and do your own pizza.The small basic pizza cost 2EUR50 and the big one 3EUR50.However small is really small, and big is medium size (pizza hut standards) Toppings are between 50c and 1EUR50. Great tasting pizza, that's why it's always busy. So maybe you should pre-order your pizza on the phone then pick it up after 15 minutes, instead of waiting in the really small place, which gets full very quickly!"
3,"Watched Deutschland lose their World Cup match here, which hurt the mood, but the food and beer were very good. I actually had the best Schweinshaxe ever and most of the time it is pretty good anywhere, you really need at least 2 people so don't order any apps if you go for that glorious piece of pork. Nice friendly service and good place to catch some sports action!"
4,"Really excellent food.  Very nice atmosphere and friendly attentive staff.  Has two menus - Italian and English, both on huge chalkboard.  These are their daily specials.I'd come back!"
2,"Solid cheap buffet. Fairly fresh, nothing too spicy, nothing too inventive. Easy to fill up here on the cheap so you don't need to eat too heavily or expensively later (if you're trying to be a budget savvy tourist). The chicken tandoori and the chicken curry were prepared well; the meat was very tender. I thought their saag was interesting - when I took my first plate it had potatoes in it, and the second time it had broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and carrot. I will say those were unusual. I'm forgetting pretty much all the other dishes since there was nothing remarkable. There was a fried veggie thing, some slightly overcooked white rice, some other veggie dishes. The mango pudding turned out to be more like an orange colored liquid sugar as I couldn't taste any mango. Not my scene. But all in all it was worth the savings to go this route and I'm glad we did. The grated coconut and sliced almond topping bowls were a nice touch. It was a pity the fresh herb was parsley and not cilantro, but we can't all be perfect."
4,"As the rest of the reviewer have already pointed out, Speicherstadt is simply a must see when visiting Hamburg. And now when Hafen City with its contemporary architecture is being developed and parts already finished, the neighbouring Speicherstadt makes a beautiful contrast with its red brick facades and green copper roofs. In 2003 Speicherstadt was removed from the Free Port and since then it also houses museums, cafés, shops and offices along with stocking tea, spices, coffe, persian rugs and the rest of the warehouse goods it is famour for."
4,"This is a Part of Hamburg anyone should have seen. Besides Dungeon, Miniatur Wunderland and a Coffee Shop there is a lot to see. Use the possibility of a Barkassenfahrt in order to complete the impression of this old part of the habour."
3,"Just had a very good 回锅肉 / twice cooked pork (around 9 EUR with rice included) here. Meat was so juicy and tender however, it was a little too saucy from what I've normally had in China. Food comes quickly, the staff is very nice and speak mandarin! Would def like to come back!"
4,"If you plan to visit Takumi, you should definitely come 15 - 20 minutes before its opening hours. The tables are arranged for 2-4 persons. We have been 8 people and the staff let us rearrange the tables so we can all sit together. The waiters were very considerate of the customers, so we didn't really habe to wait for one to take our orders. Even though we have been a big group, the food arrived very fast and everyone got their ramen at the same time. I ordered  'Karaage' and the 'Yuzu Shio Ramen' with soybean sprouts and an egg. The karaage was a decent portion for an entree. I was pretty amazed by the ramen. The soup base and the noodles were very delicious! I wasn't a big fan of the egg though because it was pretty cold. To sum it up, I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for some delicious ramen to pay Takumi a visit!"
4,Very fresh and tasty hotpot. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and the service is really paying attention to the guests.funny they are twins as waiters so you always think one is next to you. The vegetables and the fish and meet is from good quality and enough to eat - even for my big hunger. The price is not that cheap but still worth for the good service and food quality and interior.We'll come again. :)
3,"Concept of this place is great and design too.It made like real apartment, if a real apartment was with table football,bar and filled with sofas:D +they have literature and live music evenings every first and third wednesday.-Not so special drink menu.Also once my glass of wine was filled from 3 bottle leftoversphe:( Thats why only 4 stars.Otherwise this place is great."
3,"Id read about this secret suggestion on Qype before and desided to take my Dutch friends here on a sundayafternoon. Perfect opportunity considering everything is closed on Sunday and its just near to my house... Actually we wanted to go to the Hagenbeck Zoo, but it was already 3 oclock...And this museum is about animal watching as well...so why not?! This museum is fantastic! The bird section is extremely funny, escpecially the German names. Not that the German language is funny, but more the comparison with the Dutch bird names... The fact that all these animals arent real doesnt make it less entertaining..You can sit next to them, touch them (thats actually forbidden..), take some great photos and compare heights. Last but not least, you dont have to pay entrance, which allows you to just enjoy a short hour of fun and education about animals and the past. Great activity for young and old! And a good laugh..if you go there with some friends."
3,"Ah, it's just like being back in Munich! I love Munich, unlike most northern-germans, and the only thing this place is missing is a giant BMW factory. Authentically dressed waitresses serving up cheap grub and beer on benches. The size of your schnitzel is inversely proportional to the amount of sauce you get, hence Wiener Art - massive, and Jager, moderately sized. I really like it here."
4,"Absolutely huuuuuuge!! Everything is made to perfection! No waiting time, affordable prices and very friendly staff! A must for everyone who is visiting Hamburg for more than a day!"
4,"I love, love, love Loving Hut! I come here for dinner at least once a month. Although the service can be a bit slow (this place gets packed and it's family run, so sometimes there's only one guy in front), the food can't be beat and it's well worth the wait. I've tried a lot of things on the menu and enjoyed them all, but I always come back to the summer rolls and the pho. Speaking of the soup, never will you have a better meatless pho, and even before I became a vegetarian I would've said this is the best in Hamburg regardless of animals protein content. So, whether you eat meat or not, this place is highly recommended!"
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90. Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel. Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
3,"Superb establishment. Everything everyone has said is true, I realised as much after my own personal cocktail consultation on massage Mondays! What do you like? What tastes, what spirits, what mood are you in? What's your favourite colour? What's your name, where'd you come from, how many. no wait. I got recommended a Hendrick's crush, which contains crushed kumqats! What an invention, a fruit that no one had any use for before, apart from ornamental, of course. Anyway, it was delicious. I've since been back and sampled the flammkuchen (also great) and watched the fish a lot. An impressive tank. On Monday nights every customer gets a free massage too - slightly surreal, but great!"
3,"Shikara is a good Indian food place. I have only tried their lunch buffet which for a flat fee you get a full meal (an entrée, main course and desert).  They have friendly staff and a nice outdoor garden area."
4,"Asian vegan food. They are as good as the vegan food i used to eat in Malaysia. Service is sometimes slow but acceptable. Price is very reasonable 7.5€ for a main dish and a small bowl of soup or vegan spring rolls. We always choose soup. They change the soups quite often: mushroom soup, porridge, etc. My favorite choice is number 16."
3,"I love spending time at this little coffee shop and vegan restaurant because of the hipster vibe, very cool decor, and great music. There's a counter in the back where you order and then some couches and tables in the main room where you sit to eat or drink coffee. The coffee is decent (not amazing but better than average). In terms of food, I've only had a tofu wrap and a cookie, which were both pretty decent. If you're here, be sure to check out the art area right behind the restaurant called Gängeviertel; it's one of the coolest parts of the city."
4,"Finally some fresh, delicious and with love prepared food! We loved the place! Definitely a must for foodies!"
4,"I think this is my favourite park in Hamburg. It's huge, I've probably seen only 10% of it but it's the perfect place to be on a sunny day. It's never too crowded, not sure because of its size or because people prefer going to Elbstrand. In my opinion this is definitely a plus, since one can really do what he wishes, chill, read a book, play football, Frisbee, grill etc. without being hassled by the people around. There are even a couple of museums in the middle of it. I don't want to spoil this place too much, come and check it out in person. In my opinion this is a MUST see during summer time if you live in Hamburg."
4,"You'll never be disappointed with what ever you choose at Herr Max! They serve lots and lots of great cake.. My fave is Cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. Their cheesecake is the best cheesecake ever! The tanginess from cheese and lime is well balanced with the moist sweet biscuit base. And the chocolate mousse cake is not too sweet, so you can enjoy the richness of the chocolate. 3 layers of pure joy!"
3,"Indian Food in HH for the first time. The first impression wasn't very good. The spot looks a little bit dirty, empty to-go boxes lying everywhere trash bins overfilled, but the inside smells great though. We ordered two different chicken dishes and we were positively surprised. The food is really tasty and prepared very fast. I would give 5 stars if the place was cleaner and not so chaotic."
4,"I've been here quite a few times and never left disappointed. The place is and the music is always quite nice and chilled out, and Croques are delicious. I'll come back and I can definitely recommend it."
2,The english breakfast was suitable and quick. Other than the waitress who seemed to hate life this place was satisfactory.
3,"After a team building event nearby our whole team from all of our company's different offices enjoyed dinner at Bullerei.  I was told by one of my colleagues that lives in Hamburg that this is owned by a famous local chef and is a hipster restaurant.  The atmosphere is farm hipster sheik.  Since we were a big group we had a set pre fixe menu.  They were very kind to ask us if there's anything we are allergic to or strongly dislike and I told them a few of mine.A delightful amuse bouche was brought out to us before the handful of appetizers.  Everything was served family style.  A hunk of glorious burrata was served and steak tartare for appetizers.  I love medium rare beef but just can't get myself to eat tartare; I heard it was excellent though.  The burrata was nice and creamy and served with plump tomatoes and arugula.  I've heard that seafood is huge in Hamburg, and for the second dinner in a row, I was presented with huge head on prawns.  For veggies they gave us a nicely dressed salad with the right amount of dressing.  They also served us corn on the cobs with a holder.  Corn was average.  We also ordered a few bottles of Sauvingon Blanc which was light and sweet enough for my picky palette.  Next up were the entrees which were hunks of beef and some salmon.  I am super picky with fish so I went for the beef.  It was a bit fatty but the pieces I got were perfectly mid rare.  It could have used more seasoning but they also gave us a few sauces to use.  Also accompanying our protein were delicious plates of asparagus and roasted potato slices.  Gotta have your veggies and carbs! I was already stuffed, but dessert was up next, and I'm always a sucker for dessert.  They gave us various bowls of fruit mousse, a cream mousse topped with fruit, chocolate mousse, and a huge bowl of scoops of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice creams.  We were a group of about 12 women and for us it was served family style, so not sure about what others mentioned about micro portions but we had a ton of leftovers to bring to the office the next day.  I feel like it's most of Europe though, with long leisurely dinners (we got here around 8ish and left around 11).  Service was attentive and the food was good, though my favorites were the steak, veggies, and dessert.  Everything was fairly average, and I don't think there's really an area of Europe that's really known for steak unlike areas of the US.  Everyone says it's a hipster place, yes, but the area is a hipster neighborhood too.  It's a bit of a trek from our office, but if you're in the area, I'd recommend it.  I'd say 3.5ish rounded up."
2,"Perfectly good cafe with a good number of seats, music at an acceptable level and a decent range of drinks on offer. A nice selection of cakes too although the ones we had seemed to have dried out to a degree so maybe we were there just a little bit too late in the afternoon."
4,"Incredible food, great wine selection, service was excellent, and ooo the deserts were to die for. A must try while in Hamburg."
4,"Roth is a great little cosy pub/restaurant. However, if I'm honest I've never eaten here, so I'm just reviewing it as a pub. They have Rothaus Tannenzäpfle on tap, along with quite a few Irish beers, including Guiness and Murphys, so they have the beer pretty much nailed. The staff are friendly enough, and because of the restaurant side of things you get table service for your beer, which is nice. I'll have to try the food sometime"
2,"Bon café, même en été où on peut tout obtenir dans sa version frappée. Dans la série café sans service, pour ne pas citer le nom de la chaîne que je boycotte, en voilà des sympas, en fait.Ils font de bons wraps et bagels de surcroît, le tout sans prétention. Eviter les croissants. On y rencontre la faune gentillette qui part bosser de Eimsbüttel le matin tôt puis les jeunes mères dans la matinée et les pélerins qui lisent le journal, le temps passe. Au fond, on peut apparemment consulter internet. Cartes postales gratuites à la caisse.Carte à points, le 10e est offert. Je perds ma carte à chaque fois... C'est l'intention marketing qui compte, non?"
3,"Pretty awesome place, I found it after reading the Yelp reviews as there are 4 falafel places in a row pretty much. Service for starters was welcoming, even though the place was busy in my opinion I was treated with respect and the owners seemed humble. That was a nice feeling to start off with.I ordered a falafel with aubergine, the best was when I saw it being wrapped - it was huge! All for 3,50 Eur, awesome. And delicious - great to know you're not eating meat and it still fills you and tastes great.The joint actually has a smallish upstairs section including toilet, and apparently they have Wifi as well, but I couldn't find the password. The upstairs section was really cosy for a takeaway kind of place, clean as well. I'll definitely come back here and try more things from the menu."
3,"After experiencing Zoe Bar I just had to try out this place. It's a very different atmosphere. The general theme of dark has been maintained. Black floors, black walls, minimalistic lighting. The sofa's are incredibly comfortable and perfect place to chill and chat and watch whats going on from Neuer Pferdmarkt. The sofa's seemed pretty new and in comparison to the disheveled ones in Zoe Bar there was the definite trendy atmosphere present. Service was good although I was a little dissapointed that there was either various Astra's or Carlsberg. The music bothered me a little here. They had a wide range but all played quietly. When they started playing Alternative or trance stuff then that sounded plain strange when it was so quiet. I was there on a Friday night and was surprised how quiet it was inside. There was a lot of action over at Zoe 2 outside. And I had the impression people were coming over and getting there beers and going back over to Zoe 2. I will have to sample this place once more I think. Conclusion: A good bar in a good location. Minus one star for the music weirdness :)"
4,Pretty good authentic Chinese restaurant not far from the water and the piers. I felt like it was in a quieter part of town as it was in the opposite direction of most of the popular/touristy areas. Decent sized restaurant and our group went at the perfect time. It was mid day during the week and it was not busy at all. We sat at a table with a lazy suzy which is great for groups so everyone can share. The food was good and it was authentic. There were a few European twists but that is to be expected. I had the fried rice and a brisket noodle soup. Everyone shared our dishes as well and everything that I tried was good.
4,"This was the first time I had set foot on a previously operational submarine. The sub is parked up in an old industrial area on The Elbe, which is just the right setting to get you in the mood, nothing too glitzy for the old Russian sub. Inside the sub itself is really interesting, old Russian components, pipes everywhere and you get to 'see' what conditions on the sub would have been like. Plus during your journey through the sub you get to climb and crawl through the narrow doors of the sub.Then after the tour you can sit down with a nice mulled wine whilst thinking what it would be like serving on an active sub. I'd hate it, I'm far too tall, would have back problems after the first couple of days.... After the tour I had the urge to load up Red Alert 2 and take down some dolphins with my fleet of Russian subs..."
4,"A wonderful authentic German resturaunt. The cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and accomdating staff make for an outstanding experience. Do make a reservation!"
4,Tucked away just a bit but worth the walk. Friendly staff and stellar pour-over. Will return a number of times before leaving town.
3,"Chouette endroit en effet, la rue est jolie, une clientèle brassée et ma foi sympathique, service gentil, bons cocktails quand le barman est là et bonne surprise chaque fois : les prix sont très modérés. Mon chouchou : les pizzas sont excellentes, vous savez, celles avec des ingrédients frais et à pate fine. C'est simple, je ne mange jamais de pizza en dehors de chez moi, exception faite pour Gloria. Ce soir sur la carte, une pizza chèvre miel et poire, un délice! Sinon la Rucola Parma Schinken, très bonne aussi. Tables en terrasse toujours bondées à partir de 15 degrés ;-) c'est typique de Hambourg! De toutes façons, on est mieux assis à l'intérieur."
4,Delicious duck. Big quantity in the dishes. I will come back when I will be back in Hamburg
3,"Good food, and the wines were priced  faily compared to retail prices (the bottles we bough at, €49 and €99, were about 2xstore prices).The young waiter from Sardinia was very attentive and coped completely with strange Danish humor;)"
1,"This is a really great bar if you enjoy being deafened by an Elvis impersonator so much that you can't even order your beer because no one can hear you. Oh and you're blinded by strobe lights. And surrounded by a mix of drunk college kids and older people who are still college at heart. Otherwise, I think you'll find the ambiance stressful, the beer so so, and the time worth spending somewhere else."
4,High ball drinks bring back the good old times!!
3,"What a night! Went with a group of 11 and were treated to a tapas style meal selected by the owner which included four flavourful seafood courses: sea bass, sword fish, shrimp flambé and Canadian halibut.  A truly authentic Portuguese dining experience including a beautiful acoustic serenade throughout our meal.  Highly recommend."
3,The food quality is good. kebab is authentic.servers could do a better job.
4,"I'm so glad I found this place!One cold, sunny Sunday I was in the mood for a walk along the river, some hearty soup, and a peaceful place to read my book. Then up pops coffee al volo on my Yelp page, as if it were meant to be. For me, this cafe has all the comforts of home. The staff are warm and friendly, the food is made with love, and you don't feel guilty for staying for a couple hours to read, chat, or study. Each time I've gone I've seen people there with friends, family, or by themselves; enjoying each other's company or catching up on some work. Overall it has a very welcoming, open, and comfy vibe. As much as I love exploring cafes around the city, I've also been searching for my go-to, all-in-one cafe. Finally, I think I've found it! Definitely becoming one of my weekend staples."
4,"Great little lunchtime venue with a superb value set menu option. Choose anything you like from the mains, plus a selection of delicious starters, and a desert for EUR7.50. Everybody finished what they ordered, and the food tasted fresh and healthy. Lots of salad, dressing... all that good stuff. On the downside - it's extremely dark in here for lunch - but then, Hamburg is quite dark at the moment, and, they didn't have the lamb because it was sold out. Probably a victim of tasting too nice. Try this place."
4,"It is difficult when you traveling to Europe for business trip-this place is very, very good and so perfect."
3,"American tourist here. Ate here on a Sunday with wife and daughter. Strongly recommend making a reservation for any night, but particularly weekend nights. We were seated quickly upstairs as requested. The waiter took our order quickly, but it was about and hour before the food came. The waiter was great but clearly the kitchen isn't big enough for a full restaurant. Please note, they don't have an English menu, but if you know crepes, you can make do with the French. They do speak enough English to be helpful.The crepes were great. Unusual mix of ingredient options which was very similar to a creperie I tried in France once. Large selection. I had one with egg, mushrooms, ham, spinach. My daughter had a ham and cheese. Perfectly cooked and flavored. We split a couple of dessert crepes which were also delicious but also took a 1/2 hour to get. Definitely a worthy place, but plan carefully if you are with kids."
2,"There are more authentic Lebanese/Syrian restaurants in Hamburg. The guys made quite an effort so it's a little bit of a heartbreaker to give them three stars, but it is what it is.The main problem is, that the food really lacks authenticity and yet it comes at a quite high price for what it is. Please trust me on this one I have travelled the entire Middle East and I know what their cuisine is like. As a real Hamburg Docker I'll give you a heads up and recommend looking for another Syrian/Lebanese place to eat."
3,"The place is quite neat and spacious, for such times the seating is very well spread out. Food is mostly good. Got a bunch of dimsums with jasmine tea. Had a few types of shrimp dumplings and rice-rolls, totally recommend. The xiao long bao is a let down though, no broth just the minced pork. And the egg tarts were also okay-ish. We got there at 20:15 and their kitchen closes at 21:00. The waitress was constantly on our back to order and kept reaching for our order sheet (you write your order on a notepad they give you). We had to rush eventually amd write a bunch of numbers for our order."
4,"Almost got a point off for the rather long wait for a table, but otherwise a delectable start to the day. Three eggs benedict with a side of Hash Brown each, (looked and tasted a whole lot like country style potatoes to me but hey, maybe thats how they do it in Canada), and three pancakes with maple syrup were as good as inhaled by myself and two starving Bavarian brothers. Top it all off as I did with a hibiscus tea and a coffee and you'll need to be rolled out of the restaurant, like I was. (Almost.) Worth the weight."
4,A good quick overview of Indian food and taste in the center of Hamburg. Super cheap small 4.90 and large portion 6.90. Totally recommend this place if you are a tourist and would want a quick food. Very crowded
1,"I went a Sunday night with a friend. The place is nice and the sofas very comfortable. The service on the other hand was bad. I took a Mojito that was OK. My friend a virgin cocktail, but the fruit wasn't fresh. It was evident that was made from a juice box out of fridge. In addition, we had to pay straight away... It is a pity - very nice place with bad service"
2,"The food is what one typically finds in Greek restaurants in Hamburg. The atmosphere is nicer than in many places, but often loud. It's a great place for a dinner out with a group of friends, but not the ideal place for a quiet dinner in two."
0,Do not reserve tables online. We arrived with a reservation and they were full. Refused us a table even though I showed the reservation on my phone. We reserved several nights in advance for our last night on our vacation and ended up with having a burger instead!
2,"The falafel itself tasted better to me in comparison to others. Another plus is that all of their menu items can be made vegan. Yet I was turned off by the choice of some fillings such as sauerkraut and beets added by default to the falafel wrap. Seating was also limited when we visited, and the ambience was not great. It was quite cold with the door open, and cigarette smoke from those congregated by the doorway began wafting into the restaurant while we ate."
3,"This was the first place I ate on my my first day working at Qype. It's also now just across the square from where I now live.The food they serve is really really delicious and extremely good value.The decor and service is a little random, however that's all forgiven by delicious food that you can eat with a clear conscience."
4,wirklich ein sehr gutes restaurant! pizza ist hauchduenn und einfach perfekt!
4,"Simple, small place but food is fantastic. Probably the only Indian in Hamburg which offers authentic food."
0,"We made a reservation for 6 people at 6pm. We arrived and from the beginning, the female server had a major attitude. Everything we said she had to roll her eyes at us and shrug her shoulders. In fact, one of the people in our party asked for a dark beer and she replied: ""I don't know."" Again, my colleague asked for the darkest, heavier beer they had and rolling her eyes she said ""Pilsner"". If you know German beer, that is as light beer as it gets; so she recommended the total opposite. I lived in Germany and was letting it slide. She kept with the attitude while we order our food. Some of the members in my party have never been there and asked a few questions about the menu. She just kept acting as we were a waste of her time. When she asked me for my choice, I finally said to her: ""are you ok?"" And she, rolling her eyes one again, said: ""Ja, why?"" And I finally said, ""because since we walked in this restaurant you have had a very sarcastic and nasty attitude and you can now drop it."" She was in shock that I confronted her. After she walked away, the members of my party said: ""I thought it was me who noticed and attitude but I did not want to say anything."" But I did. And here is the deal: The server does not know that some if the members in my dinner party come to Hamburg every week, sometimes 4 to 5 times a month with different colleagues from work and we recommend to each other places to eat. In fact, I thought the food was quite mediocre and I've had much better Germany food in other locations nearby. I will definitely not recommend this restaurant to any of my colleagues any longer and personally, will never step one foot in this place again. (Better food: Restaurant Franziskaner near the lake in the center of town)."
0,We were two Danish guys being treated very hostile as if they don't foreigners. Don't go there if you're not German
4,Fisch & co. serve up tasty fresh fish with multiple choices. You can eat inside or outside. It has a really rustic feel and is on the oldest street in Hamburg. The staff is friendly and prices are good.
3,"4 Stars for the Burger.  My boyfriend and I were too late Saturday night to eat in the main dining room, so we tried the front deli.  It was ok, nice ambience, service and decor, and the food was okay.  However, the burger was great.  Came with coleslaw, fresh tomato and a perfectly cooked piece of burger.  Every evenly flavored and overall amazing.  Onion soup needed a spice pick up.  Would try this place again!"
3,"Good and cheap restaurant  in Altona, near the beach. They serve sausages with bread and potatoes salad, and other traditional German fast-food. We were sitting at a table which was just in the way between the stairs and the beach, so there was a lot of passing."
4,"I loved this place! The staff is very friendly and fast! However, in case you don't like waiting for others to finish eating, I suggest you to book a table in advance :)"
3,We had a dinner with 15 colleagues there and they seated us in the nice kind of outside area with a roof. It was a little bit tight for 15 people but it was okay.It took a long time until we got our food but that was probably because the restaurant was packed and we were a lot of people.I got the Pizza Vegetarina with extra Artichokes for around 10 Euro and an alcohol free beer. It was very delicious and it just costed 14 Euro in sum.You get a good but not the best pizza.
3,"I chose this place based on the comments on qype!It's a small restaurant/café in the Hamburger Hof 'mall'.We got there on a tuesday at around 6pm. It was empty, so we got to choose the table we found most appealing.The menu has a wide variety of food including salads, soups, pasta and pizza. They also have the Menu of the day which is written on a blackboard. It includes dishes that arent listed on the 'normal' menu.They also have an extra coffee menu. I had a salad, the rucola/schafkäse salat, which was really really good. The portion is rather generous. It's not very expensive.Two persons, 2 drinks was at around 20EUR. Very fair for what they're offering. I'll definitely be back"
3,"This little beach bar is a Hamburg institution. Little did I know when I got there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon that they're actually open year-round. You can't really miss it as it's located in an old hut right at the beach Övelgönne.With 37F out there people were sunbathing (wrapped in their jackets like Eskimos, of course) and it's clear that this is one of Hamburg's hot spots to chill (or walk the beach).Strandperle serves coffee & tea, as well as soups and snacks. It's usually packed but the line moved quickly when I was there.I admit that I'm a tourist in Hamburg but this place is on my list whenever I'm back in the city."
4,"One of the better meals we had while in Hamburg.  The giant white asparagus was in season and was delicious.  Food was presented in a simple clean elegant manner, and more importantly, everyone liked their meal.  Service was attentive as well."
2,this parlour is open all year round.strawberry ice-cream is recommended.don't go to tiramisu.
4,Very nice place to look at from both the inside & the outside. The building is clean and well maintained! Don't forget to sign the guest book!!
3,Great burgers - best I've had in years - I had the Crack Burger and it was kind of addictive but I wouldn't have sold my body for it. Service is slow though. I down rated one star because of this. I would have down rated two stars - but they acknowledged the poor service in the menu.
4,"pannfisch is essentially the hamburg's take on fish and chips and yes it's way better. i think they use three kinds of fried fishes. i have to admit that they taste a little funny like every time i have a fish dish in germany. it all tastes funny. lake fish. sea fish. so i guess it is its own taste, but i can grow into that. it comes with senfsauce which is a mustard sauce. good idea. packed with flavor as opposed to your usual tartar suace. and bratkartoffel always wins my heart. and don't forget to get your beer.this place is a one-man operation place. you go to the counter to order and to pay. they are not used to foreign tourists around here. i ordered in german, so i am not sure if they speak english. the bathroom is in the icecream shop next door, which also provides a seamless transition to dessert. 1 euro icecream = yes please. when your CEO works at yelp and he said he liked it, i have to believe it right?"
2,Nice little cafe where you can grab a selection of teas and snacks along with some typical main dishes of pastas etc.Nice areas to sit and chat or if you are by yourself grab a paper and catch up on the worlds going on.
3,"I actually got lost looking for this place. I'm a damn tourist that doesn't know how to read street signs, let alone have a sense of direction whatsoever. A bartender recommended Oma's but we misunderstood what he said so we walked around in circles until we found it. The place was packed even on a weeknight so we knew it was good.The food is surprisingly good and cheap too. I ordered the schnitzel with bacon. Everything is good with bacon! It came with potatoes and lots of bacon. It was quality food for under €10. You should come here with a big appetite because the Germans are known for serving huge portions."
3,"Now, I was a bit apprehensive about how much I would enjoy this and how much time I could actually spend looking at miniature figures but, I surprised myself on how facilitating it all was.  All these tiny figures painted and positioned in such detail.  Every time you looked at something different you were stood for a while taking it all in.  Then you would spot something quirky going on like a naughty couple in the car or a random dinosaur lurking somewhere so then you start a little hide and seek to see what else you can find that no one else may have spotted.It isn't just figures standing around either.  Hit the buttons nearby to activate movement in certain areas.  Again, sometimes this took a while to spot what was actually moving/changing so absorbed more of your attention and time.The time, detail and effort put into everything is truly amazing and I think everyones favourite is the airport where you can want planes landing and taking off (I kid you not!).  There are things there that just make you stop and look and look and somethings which make you laugh.  You will be wandering around in here for some time and, depending on how busy it is, you will be surprised about how much time you actually spend in here.We came a little late in the evening so had to quickly move through the last part however, I know we could have spent another half hour there on just that bit having been there for probably 1 hour before hand.  We were able to move through fairly reasonable pace but if it is busy, I can imagine you would easily double this time.As they are adding countries and places to this all the time, I'd imagine you could come back in a few months to see more and spend equally as much time in here."
4,"We enjoyed our first lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe Hamburg so much, we came back the next day. It's always fun to see the different memorabilia displayed and the fun music selections. The host, Edwin was so friendly and personable. Our server, Nico was great! He was friendly and gracious. The food was very good too.  It helped make our harbor tour and trip to Germany even more memorable."
4,"Great food, nice service, good atmosphere! You get a tasty treat of flat bread with olive oil and an herb mix to enjoy while you're waiting for your mealand it's worth the wait. Unique flavors, trendy style. More of a fusion/modern cuisine than Lebanese  excellent food! Be sure to reserve a seat if you want to go on the weekend."
2,"Tiefenthal is a café that's trying to be a restaurant as well as a bar at once. It's most successful at being an upper class café (and rallying point for yummy mommies and the like) and acceptable for a drink, but I'd avoid the more complex restaurant offerings. There's a simple rule: Tiefenthal is good at simple things - salads, roastbeef and sandwiches. Unfortunately though the chef struggles with anything more fancy; the more expensive, the worse, at least as far as I can speak from my own experiences. The Wiener Schnitzel, for example, is a disgrace and not even cheap. There are about a dozen places I know in Hamburg where you can get a much better quality Schnitzel for the same money (Casse-Croute near Gänsemarkt, for example). Another problem is the service. On a busy, sunny afternoon it can take ages before you get your homemade ice tea (which is wonderful, by the way). Most waiters/waitresses are professional at their job, but on occasion I've had to deal with one particular waitress whose attitude is rather bold (bordering on impertinent). All things considered I wouldn't mind visiting the place every once in a while, as long it's not for proper lunch/dinner. But then again, if you're allergic to the Eppendorf hoi polloi, you should avoid the Tiefenthal at any cost."
4,"Mr. Kebab is a turkish restaurant with an really accelent service. You can't compare it to the common opinion of turkish food, like Dönerbuden. Like I said, the service is brilliant and the food too. Yummie, really a lot and you can pay it. My advice: The Grillteller for two (it's enought for 3 easily even for 3 men) And: Got to the toilette there. It's an experience ;)"
4,"Amazing museum, great collection !There are so many details, like lights from the interior of trains. I loved the day/night scenography, it is a brilliant idea !I think I just fell in love with this museum !"
3,"Went here recently as one of my colleagues recommended it. Everything was tasty and seemed fresh. The place was packed at lunch so many other people also seem to think the place is good. It's fairly tight seating-wise but again, if a lot of people are here, things are being prepared fresh and it's a good sign in my eyes. There is an extensive menu and the pricing is definitely fair for the area. There is also seating out front if the weather plays along. I wouldn't call this place a ""destination"" but surely a good choice if in the area."
4,"I don't really do reviews, this is more of a personal bookmark, so to meet the minimum word count I'll just say it is definitely a chinese restaurant, located in Hamburg."
3,"I was here at lunch/breakfast time. The place is in itself very nice and has a cool atmosphare. The food was also good but some details were missing to be perfect. The choice of breakfast is a bit reduced for my tastes, but all the dishes were prepared with care. Unfortunately the egg was cold :( they have a much better offer of luch dishes, like pasta, sandwiches and soups. The say that all the ingredients are bio and home made. The service is nice but a little slowof course that could mean that they really prepare evey dish live and not microwave. At last i would like to point out the cool juices and the always available water!"
3,"The best about this restaurant is the terrace and the view of the Hafen. When you combine it with a very friendly staff and great food, it's just perfect! We loved both their meals as well as desserts"
4,"Definitely a part of town you have to visit. It's not simply one of the stops on a tour of Hamburg. It should be a necessary stop if trying to get a feel for the city. It's bordering on one of the largest construction sites in Europe...the Hafencity. Once complete, the Speicherstadt itself will become even more vibrant. It will also help once the U4 subway line runs to the area. Worth coming to see just to walk around and thereafter grab a coffee somewhere. Near the water and best visited in the summer but just as good when it's cold and less people are out and about."
4,"You like tabletop gaming and mead? This is the place for you!A wonderful little basement bar that's full of cliches and atmosphere. From the medieval style kitsch decor to the barrells full of games (literally! the barrells have latched doors and when you open them, boom, plethora of tabletop games inside) this is a theme bar not to be missed!Bring a few friends, grab a table and a board game and enjoy a mead or two. Or come on your own and make new friends! Several of their games have English versions as well and they have Wasabi, which is a quick dice game with instructions in fifteen or so languages. It does get quite crowded on weekends and evenings, but go and have a look anyway, you might be lucky and grab a nice spot. Definitely one of my faves in the city."
4,"Great place to have dinner eating typical food of hamburg: fish!Nice interior, great and nice service, beer and wine, quick service.For us this evening was the last of a few days in hamburg; a real great finish!"
3,"Very nice service, nice setting, nice german fare and (what appears to be) local clientele. Liked it."
0,"Heard great things about this restaurant from a friend who travels to Hamburg frequently, and the fact that they closed at 11 was even better! The night before we had called to confirm what time their kitchen closed and we were told 10:30. However, when we arrived the next day at 9:10, we were told that they weren't seating + serving anymore and we were forced to find another dining option last min on our last night in Hamburg."
0,"Really horribly rude on the phone. The hours on yelp are wrong, I called at ten pm, could hear noise in the background but they stated it was closed. I asked what time it closed and he wouldn't tell me. Don't go here there are better places with superior customer service"
4,"Food was good, vegetarian and fairly-priced! It was a little hard to find a seat, but that is always a good sign :)"
2,It's at least interesting. Every meal is potato and something. Was an OK meal but I won't be rushing back.
4,Where does one hear the ships already better? Where does one see one more dog? Where does one see more Punks (there are it still) and infants on a heap? Where do the people wait so patiently and in a long line for their fried sausage? In the beach pearl! Directly at the beach of the Elbe stop of everything is possible. And n the winter: country under. Also beautifully!
3,"The burger is simply amazing and service keep improving over time.I would recommend Dulf's as a great place to have a burger with friends, but be aware that they do not take reservation over phone."
4,Strongly recommend this place! Genuine turkish experience and turkish breakfast at its best.
3,A tasty and sensual combination of classic American diner food and Korean delicatessen. Every bite of the burger was juicy and filled with flavor. I'm looking forward to coming again and trying out more from this inexpensive and delicious hidden corner
2,"I'm glad I went, but I also wish I spent more time on the Reeperbahn during my stay in Hamburg, and this is what I would cut out. It was a fun experience that's not too far away from other things you'll probably want to see, but it wasn't as educational or informative as I thought it would be.I went alone, and ended up being the only person on the submarine for most of my time down there. I was creeped out a lot more than I thought - it's a really tight and dark space with terrible gas fume smells. There's a loud engine room, but the rest of the space has fake sonar ping audio being piped in. There's little camera lenses cut into various walls so the people in the office can watch you as you browse through, but other than that, you're free to go at your own pace - provided there's enough room for others to squeeze by. Also, I'm really hoping all the white fibrous insulation isn't asbestos.All the original signage and instruments are in Russian (which is awesome) and there's some English signs showing what rooms were used for. Don't go if you have any mobility issues, you will be climbing up and through awkward holes.If you're looking for something nearby that might be more interesting, I thought the Alter Elbtunnel that goes under the river with a massive elevator for cars was pretty exciting."
2,"I had been craving Mexican food since moving to Hamburg and this seemed to be one of the better local places from Yelp reviews, so I decided to give it a try this evening.I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender was friendly. I decided to order a beef burrito based on ""burrito"" being in the title of this place; although, people sitting next to me ordered quesadillas which looked great, and there are also enchiladas. There are very above average vegetarian options, including spinach, mushrooms, nopal, tofu, and seitan for burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.The burrito wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great. I liked the texture of the tortilla (pressed on the grill), but the fillings weren't particularly good tasting. I also thought the burrito was lacking flavor and could have used more ingredients (some salsa, sour cream, and guacamole like the quesadillas included certainly would've been nice). The steak, rice, and beans weren't bad but didn't taste particularly good. There were also diced tomatoes and onions that were fine.Overall, I would go here if you're in the mood for Mexican food and in the area because it's not bad, but I can't recommend this place for having a particularly good burrito."
4,"Amazing food in a warm, somewhat stuffy basement filled with Chinese people even on Tuesday night (always a good sign).Very good Dim Sum, Kai Lan with garlic, even the small spring rolls were perfect  super crispy and fresh. This is REAL Chinese.I have had a lot of Chinese food over the years but this was certainly one of the best and I will certainly go here again on my next visit to Hamburg :)"
4,"Wow, super entertaining..... For 30minutes, water fountains dance along to music accompanied by a range of lights to change the colour of the water..... Whether you are a tourist or a local, would definitely recommend popping by one evening for this completely free event in planten u blomen park"
3,"If you want yummy pierogis, vodka and a great location in north St. Pauli, this is the place to go."
3,"Kumpir is a little gem of a place on Schanzenstr. Basically they only sell baked potatoes, and the most expensive thing on the menu is EUR3.90, and that's what I went for. A mexican-themed baked potato. It came with cheese, chicken, salsa, nachos tomatoes and jalapenos. It really hit the spot. I'll definitely be back."
4,Fantastic and classy bar. Excellent whisky selection and not too crowded. Staff are very professional.
3,"We totally love the ambiance of the place! The start of service was fast and we did not wait very long for the food to be served. The food itself is very good! All of us have nothing to complain about our respective orders. The price is slightly higher to what we normally spend on an ordinary weekend with friends, however, it is justifiable!! End of service is, sadly, very slow. Originally, we wanted to order desserts and drinks as we wanted to stay longer... But after waiting and waiting and waiting for how long, we decided to just get the bills versus ordering anew. They have no problem with ""seperate"" bills & just need to request for it. I wanted to give them 4.5 rate, but as there is no 0.5 they ended up at 4. We will definitely go back!!"
3,"Vegetarian, but surprisingly not bad! The Eggs Benedict was great with potatoes and fruit cup. The entire staff was all female which was really cool. They were working very, very hard. Service was kind of slow, but that may be a German thing. Not much seating. I had ice water, which they didn't try to sell me a pricey bottle...nice. Freshly squeezed OJ and hand-spun shakes. This is a local favorite restaurant. The neighborhood is kind of suspect, but definitely OK during the day when w went. This was truly home cooking. I would go here again, bring a guest and recommend to a friend (but prepare them all with a description of the place)"
4,"Outdoor seating, great food/soup, nice little sandwiches. Love it!"
1,"We were walking around looking for somewhere for a quick snack and popped in to this cool looking restaurant. After ordering food and drinks we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. There where 5 other occupied tables and three waitresses but nothing seemed to happen. I started timing. Ten minutes after we ordered, we were told the drinks they would be with us shortly. They arrived five mins later with the food. (Quick tip: ALWAYS bring the drinks ASAP and ALWAYS before the food- that way it's more likely that a second drink will be ordered; thus making more money and maybe more tips.)The food however was good and the portions large but nothing out of this world. Cute inside. Quite highly priced but OK if you're not expecting much. Large terrace and a good place to ""be seen"" if thats what you're into.Wouldn't  recommend too highly."
4,"Delicious falafel, great price. What more could you ask for? The falafel kimo has tons of sauce, cheese, lentils, potatoes, vegetables. Falafel in Brot is also great, just more of a focus on the delicious falafel."
3,"Froindlichst is an all-vegan restaurant in Winterhude with a variety of foods including burgers, pizza, burritos, and salads. There's also a full coffee and tea menu, a few cakes, and an ice cream section.I had the ""Den Burger"", which is some sort of play on words that escapes my feeble German. It's a lentil patty on a bun with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, ketchup, and some kind of basil cream. It comes served with too few sweet potato fries, and an extra little plate of the basil cream. The burger itself is quite large and filling, and actually pretty tasty. The condiments seemed like too much at first, but when you realize how dense and large the patty is, you're glad to have something to dip it in. The fries are pretty fantastic, but again, there aren't enough of them.To say I was apprehensive about trying Froindlichst would be an understatement. Aside from being a vegan restaurant (a category I mostly avoid), there were a few warning signs. First, my wife had made a reservation online, but when we arrived there wasn't a table set aside for us. Fortunately, there were plenty of empty tables, but this seemed like an opportunity for disappointment. Second, the service was perfectly friendly, but when we placed our order, the sound of juicy burgers hitting the grill didn't exactly emanate from the kitchen. Laid back, they are. Fortunately, all's well that ends well, and at the end of the day, I left satisfied and pleasantly surprised."
2,"We wanted to try out the restaurant because the reviews were quiet good. The first impression was good. The atmosphere is good. You can sit outside if you reserve a table in advance.We ordered a starter. A mixed starter plate cost 18€. Even though it is overpriced, it was delicious. For bread you pay an additional 4€. As a main starter we ordered homemade pasta with truffle (28€) and Pasta Aglio with scampis (18€). The homemade pasta with truffle was delicious. But still very overpriced. Pasta Aglio was really disappointing. Tiny four scrimps were added. Winterhude is known for the higher prices. We were very disappointed. I am willing to pay more if the quality and the service is good. This was not the case. We waited 1.5h for the main course. Service was not asking whether we want more drinks or have any other wishes. All in all this place is a overpriced. The service is not great. You need to wait a long time to be served. The dishes are not outstanding."
4,"What a unique and fascinating experience we had at Miniatur Wunderland! It is simply incredible to see the excitement and enthusiasm in the eyes of the children and their parents, while wondering through the Mini-World. So many little details to see and discover, all kinds of dramas and events have been carefully put into life in America, in Hambourg, at Frankfurt-Airport, in Berlin, in Switzerland, Austria or Italy ...! hours are not enough to really take in all one can contemplate in Miniatur Wunderland! We loved it, and will definitely go there again!"
3,A pretty good Indian restaurant considering it's in Hamburg. Handy location right by Mundsberg station on the U3 line.
4,Pretty cool  spot for having cocktails  and wine  with a lot of people. Seems to be a place to be for a night out !
3,"We just stopped in for a coffee and snack after a long walk, but was happy with the service and atmosphere. Would like to go back sometime for a more proper meal."
4,"Great Burger. I went to a place called Peter Pane my first day in Hamburg and this place blows it out the water. Fresh Ingedients, Fresh Beef, Great combinations, very good burger. The only thing I didnt care for was the long wait for our food, but the place was crowded and understandably so. I recommend this place if you want a Hamburger in Hamburg!"
0,"A place that calls it self CHICAGO MEATPACKER and just offers 3 american beers (and 3 standard beers at that) seems like a rip off wrapped up in an US theme to me.Haven't had food there, because the beer experience was enough already."
4,Best breakfast in the center of Hamburg.Try the self baked buns - best buns in town!The scrambled egg is very yummy and you should definitely try it out!
1,"Clouds is a beautiful place to have dinner or drinks and I have been there several times. The food and cocktails are always delicious and I would say that they are worth the high price. As a grand finale to my mother's visit from abroad (and first time in Hamburg) I took her to Clouds the night before she flew the 27 hours home. Unfortunately this time I was utterly disappointed and have a particularly bad taste left in my mouth as a result of the service and tipping rationale. Our 'personal' waitress was abrupt and argumentative from the beginning when we simply asked if there were any tables by the window free. She then presented herself as our sommelier saying she could absolutely recommend the perfect wine to match our dishes and went on to dismiss the whole wine list and suggest merely the most expensive red and white wines on the menu. As a wine scientist I found this incredible considering the wine list has many options, and plenty that would have been a far better match. When attempting to discuss the wines with her she was dismissive and simply told me I was wrong by saying that Spätburgunder is the same variety of grape as Pinot Noir. I strongly recommend that your waitresses are trained in wine service (at least) before they claim to be sommeliers.Despite feeling hustled throughout our dinner we enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the restaurant. When it came to the bill I found the cost of the meal and a section below to rate our experience. Having not ticked a rating the waitress pushed me define if I was satisfied, happy or ecstatic with the experience. I was more than happy to give them a rating but found it staggering that the rating was accompanied by a percentage tip (already calculated from the total cost of the bill). Although I thoroughly believe in tipping when it is deserved and intended to tip for this meal too, being forced to tip is uncouth and a significant faux pas on the behalf of the restaurant management (who incidentally, were on holidays and not available to speak to on the night we were dining). My advice - train your staff in wine, don't force the tipping with satisfaction ratings on the bill."
1,"A real dissapointment!We had the 400 gr Western Steak today. Inspite of the fact that I had asked the waiter, and he had asked the cook, to make me a steak brown and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, what I got was a rubbery piece of meat, that was cooked a low heat, had no brown crust on the outside, nor was it juicy on the inside, and just not good at all. No way they will get me back here. Friendly service does not help when the food is lousy! What a shame"
4,"I love having lunch on fridays at the Kornhauskeller. The staff is very friendly, lunch prices are well affordable and the dishes are always clean, tasty, fresh and very well prepared. My favorite is the fish in mustard seed sauce, but their falafel is the best I've had in Hamburg by far. Very very recommended! A Hamburg favorite!"
4,Great lil Surprise to find this Vegan Optional Middle Eastern Food. Farina at the counter was kind enough to explain everything to us in English & monitor our spending cz we only had 20 Euros in cash until I could find an ATM In Hamburg that would take my card. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this sweet lil Palestinian Cafe run by Farina & the Palestinian Family. ENJOY
3,"My colleague and I were both craving some schnitzel and a good beer. As luck would have it, this place was a short walk from our hotel and it did not disappoint.The Location - Directly along one of the canals, the side of the dining room with large windows serves as a great spot to take in the sights. Get there early if you want a window seat, however, as the room fills up quickly as the night goes on.The Beer - Solid micro brews, most of which are made in the German style. The Pilsner was light and refreshing, and the Hefeweizen was fruity and tasty. It was fun to see onsite brewing urns and various ingredients and equipment as you walk through the place.The Food - The schnitzel did not disappoint. Served in various styles and accompanied by various preparations of potatoes and other veggies, I'd easily go back if my next schnitzel craving hits while in Hamburg.The Service - Not spectacular, but they did their job. Not much personality to speak of. The food came, the beer came, and the empties disappeared. Worked for us."
4,"Ok, this is official. Milch is my favorite coffee place in Hamburg now. Flat white is amazing good."
3,"came here for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend. don't even remember what we ordered (there was a lot of it!) but i was super impressed. it's such a delight as a vegetarian to be able to order basically anything on the menu. everything was delicious, the sampler appetizer platter thingy was wonderful, so full of different flavors and spices. we had a lovely bottle of wine with our dinner which i liked very much even though i'm not really a drinker. the server was friendly & helpful. really not much to complain about here. the chairs could be a bit comfier & the lights dimmer (it is a dinner place, after all!). they also won't give you a glass of water -- you have to buy a bottle. and yeah, it's pricey -- we dropped an even €100 including tip on our evening here. but for a delicious, all-organic vegetarian meal, it's certainly worth the occasional visit."
4,Most amazing place! Great personale and service from the get go! Food soooo delicious -nothing less! Go people! Go!!! Remember only German credit card or cash!Denmark
3,"I'm an Asian. Their Chinese food of course is a bit German style for me but for German it is the best what they can have with a very very good price, especially with the growing kids, they can have as much as they can. After the extension of the restaurant, the sittings area even bigger and more comfortable, and also they provide some outside sittings too."
0,Pretty poor experience with Kofookoo. Booked a table for a Saturday night way in advance through Yelp reservations. Table for 4 wasn't available on arrival. Restaurant claimed Yelp reservations do not match technically with their reservations system. Since the place was packed they couldn't offer a place at the bar or table in a appropriate time span. Disappointing.
3,"Not a perfect taste but good in Hamburg. I tried first time in 2015 and was disappointed, after one year I tried again was much better than first experience. I had miso ramen and it was ok, the soup was thick enough but I'm not a fan of its noodle. Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) was good. If you like to eat spicy food (really spicy) karai ramen with Korean kimchi flavor would be the best choice."
3,"Another pizza success! Came to Al Volo for a lovely Saturday lunch. We arrived right at opening time so there was only one other table occupied. The interior looked nice and new. We sat at one of the tall tables with stools. I ordered the Margherita while the Mr. ordered pizza salame. The dough was thin and chewy, just how I like it. The toppings were also very tasty; the salame had quite a bit of a kick! The size of the pizza was just enough--not too much, not to little. We washed it down with some wine. The location of the restaurant is in a nice area, so great way to have some good pizza and go for a stroll afterwards."
2,"Not sure what it is about Asian restaurants that they feel it's necessary to have multiple different kinds of stiumulation going on during your meal. I walked in and was bombarded with 1) loud asian music 2) blasting TV with some fishing reality show and 3) loaded newspaper rack.I was tired, and hungry, and it was a block away so I went for it. Under other circumstances probably wouldn't have tried it as the menu doesn't seem anything to write home about. I Had a quick meal of noodles with chicken and veggies, large beer and was out the door. I can say, however, that the noodles were not drowing in MSG which was a nice change from a lot of asian food you find in Germany.The patio DOES seem nice though, and I would go again if that's where I was ending up for the evening."
3,"Very good brunch with homemade marmalade, pesto and tiny pieces of delicious cheesecake! The staff is very friendly. I went there on a Sunday so it was very crowded in the small Coffee shop.I like to go there again."
2,"A nice restaurant, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The quality of the food was good and the meels were all typically german or austrian... But it was really not as elaborate as to justify the high prices."
0,"I have been a regular customer for the last 2 years of this winebar somehow pleased by the cosy atmosphere of this place and the fact that is located close to where I leave. Friday 30th of July around 8:00 pm me and my gf have decided spontaneously to have a dinner again without booking a table.When we approached the queue a ""very kind"" girl at the entrance gently invited us to seat on a table in front of the entrance.Due to the fact that outside was very windy and cold and the front door was open to allow the people to enter we kindly denied to seat on that table (for the above reasons) asking to sit at the bar to have 1 or 2 drinks (as allowed to the couple in front of us in the queue) while waiting to have another table later on in the evening.Suddenly the girl clearly annoyed by our request has decided to show all the empathy skills acquired in this industry over the years and claimed that if we did not want to sit on that table we should have left the restaurant as they do not like to move people around tables...!!Coming from this business many years and having worked as a waiter during my studies in a multitude of restaurants in different countries it is shocking how you can people can even call this behaviour ""service"".My only request was to have 2 drinks at my expense while waiting for a table to be free later on in the same evening.I used to come to this place once a month with an average expense of 40 euro per person when in 2 and more when with other friends.This is the treatment you can get at the Vineyard in Hamburg even if you are a regular customer and horrifying it is actually a compliment.This is my first bad review I have ever left on Yelps but it is crucial that everybody have a clear picture of the venue you are visiting before deciding to spend the evening and your money.From my side they will never see me again!"
3,Had a very good steak here. Argentinian rump steak done perfectly.
3,"a classic hangout in Hamburg's Sternschanzeit's a beautifully restored ground floor  salon furnished with vintage sofas. Some of them are so old that you might feel the springs but that's part of the atmosphere I guess.It's a good place to meet people or just watch people because on Friday and Saturday nights the place is buzzing and you will most likely share your soda space with others - so conversation is eased. The drinks are helpful as ice-breakers, of course.During the day it is cafe, especially nice when it opens its front windows in the summer so it has a whole open front wall.Their bathrooms are a shame though.... but that seems to be a general problem in Hamburg..."
4,"Imagine being the coldest you've ever been, yet happily chilling at a lovely beach bar sipping on a super delicious Pimm's cocktail and eating what appears to be one of the only 3 vegetarian items on the menu. Are you imagining this?It is amazing. Fun decor, great people, interesting bathrooms, and a really great casual vibe. Come for the drinks and the great view. Eat something so you don't get totally wasted. Drink some more and then vow to return. Rinse and repeat."
1,"I have been at Casa Rita for lunch with some colleagues.First of all, I'm not sure why somebody would define this bistro as ""Italian"". Yes they do have a selection of different type of pasta dishes but I would find it difficult to define any of them Italian.They have a wide selection of food to make a personalised antipasto, but I cannot judge it since I haven't tried it.The bread looked good and tasted great; I cannot say the same for the pasta (we ordered three types) which was generally overcooked and tasteless.Since I wouldn't visit it again I will give it 2 stars."
3,"Potato everything, even menus shaped like smiling potatoes. Food was pretty good, standard German fare. Portions generous and prices quite reasonable. One of the more expensive entrees plus a beer cost under 20 euros. Dark and cosy ambience (Keller means cellar, so most of the restaurant is, you guessed it, in a cellar.)"
3,"This one is not a restaurant, more a takeaway and a snackbar!I can recommend to take away, because its really full inside and the service its not the perfect one. But if you eat inside (or in the summer outside), the waiter is really nice and helpful!! Food: huge portions and yummy :D Some days,they are really bussy, but you should wait :D and try the dönerteller with fries :D enjoy your food!!"
2,"Went here in January, on a saturday. place was more packed than a can of sardines! couldn't even reach the bar, getting to the restroom was almost out of the question, and actually, now that i remember, even getting into the bar itself was a pain. people standing in the doorway smoking. lol. I'm sure its nice when its not that busy, but if you happen to go when it is too busy, just run across the street to haus 73 and get cozy there."
2,"Interesting concept than the one where you have to take off your shoes if you want to eat! Fear not though, you don't have to do this in the entire place. As part of a group we were offered a sitting area with low tables and stools laid out on oriental carpets, only area where shoes off are indeed required! Be geared up with funky socks, as it may make the entire experience more exciting! :)I'm not a vegetarian but always enjoy the variety of food and mixed vegetables on offer. 9EUR for a falafel with chips, side salad and a glass of wine, I say pretty cheap experience for lovely & much filling food!Why the 3 stars? Although all the staff was really lovely, the service was pretty slooooow. None of us really managed to eat at the same time. One tip: don't order red wine! But again, I'm French, my expectations may be pretty high :)"
3,"Tours cost around €15 per person, which seemed a bit much at first.  The tour lasted around 90 minutes, and we took the English one (there is one English tour M-F per day and two on the weekend days).  It walked us through the process to make chocolate and offered 7 samples throughout the process from bean to wrapped chocolate which they made throughout the tour.  Our guide was awesome, and made the whole thing well worth it.  Also, we got to decorate our own bar of chocolate to take home as a souvenir."
4,Fabulous.  I had the Endivine crepe anda glass of  Ventoux rouge.  The Roquefort sauce on the crepe was delectable.  The place is absolutely charming- including the staff.  The tables by the windows are so quaint.  This is just what I needed.
4,"Finally ended up going here after planning to do so for a while. Not always in the Brasserie mood but this time it fit perfectly. Really enjoyed Carls. I personally like the decor and loved the booth we sat in....we had a two-top. Had a partial view of the harbor but also had the table ""to ourselves"" which we really enjoyed. Not going to go into detail as many others have but service was top-notch from start to finish. Absolutely no complaints in this regard. Very professional and attentive. The food was also great. We had some oysters, a starter soup, the noodles with truffles and the Boeuf bourguignon. For dessert we shared the chocolate dessert with bananas and mango. Really enjoyed everything from start to finish. We skipped the flat-rate water for a normal bottle of still water. Not much more expensive to be honest unless you come thirsty. The wine was a bit off (Salvay Spätburgunder) but this was simply because of our taste. Wasn't bad but I was expecting something different....not the restaurants fault in any way. Finally, as others have mentioned, the toilets are really nicely done as well. I even snuck into the private room downstairs (with it's own bar...have to remember that for my next company event) to check out the IWC event going on....considering I'm a watch buff. Highly recommend Carls if you like Brasserie food. Don't be put off by the Hafencity surrounding. Only the philharmonie is to be completed. Everything else around the building Carls is in is complete. Will be great place to eat next summer as well once the weather is good again...nice large outdoor area."
3,"Original Persian food, nice place, wide variety of persian foods, and also some traditional persian I've creams!"
4,"Just yummy!Opening times are a bit unusual, and you have to get there early to get a table and/or a certain dish because they only prepare a certain amount of any given dish. They do deliver a few chosen dishes and these are really good!"
2,"I even read the reviews ahead of time, but I wanted this place to be a good option in the neighborhood for an easy lunch or dinner. It just didn't impress me.We went early on a Saturday evening, and were seated promptly in a little booth towards the back (which was great). My daughter got some colored pencils and a coloring menu, so she was set. We ordered a round of burgers, including one off the kids' menu for my daughter.I had the bacon cheeseburger, which was a couple of very flat and overcooked patties smothered in toppings (to be eaten with a fork, in the local style). Passable, but not fantastic. My wife's ""veggie burger"" turned out to simply be a large piece of fried/melted mozzarella with some peppers integrated somehow, then topped with arugula and stuck in a bun. It was a little comical; we should have read the menu more closely, but we didn't.The service was fine (in fact the waitress was fairly attentive), but it just wasn't a great experience. Too bad."
4,The best six euros you'll spend on Indian food! The mango lassi is delicious and I highly recommend the matter paneer and the butter chicken. Not great for big groups though.
3,"A nice cafe sneaked away in a small pedestrian street offering tasty breakfast options like french toasts, pancakes or english breakfast.  The service can be a little slow but the food is great."
4,"I know it is going to sound strange to read this, but I gotta let it out. How niiiice the people here are. My best friend wanted to book a table yesterday and one of the staff members from the kitchen just showed us a piece of paper which basically said: Please take NO more bookings for tonight! He smiled at us and showed it to us, but asked us to leave our number just in case there might be an open spot later. My friend received a call, called back and this friendly woman just said: Hello Alex! Yeah..now you are surprised, right?! And he was. Unfortunately they didin't have a free table for the time he wanted, but he said being declined with such a nice explanation will make him come back pretty soon and this time he will book days in advanced. This seems to be the new/old hidden hot spot in the hood.I am exited to get to know it and then write another feedback."
4,"Unbedingt empfehlenswert!    Wir haben gestern einen wundervollen Abend im Restaurant Unter Deck erlebt.    Von einem sehr netten jungen Servicemitarbeiter wurden wir in Empfang genommen und an einem geschmackvoll eingedeckten Tisch platziert.    Nach dem Apèro, welchen uns der sympathische Mitarbeiter offeriert hat, sind wir in der gut gestalteten Karte schnell fündig geworden.    Schön ist, dass sich die einzelnen Gänge der vorgeschlagenen Menüs untereinander kombinieren ließen, da die Einzelpreise jeweils aufgeführt sind.    Weiterhin war die Zeit zwischen den einzelnen Gängen sehr gut abgestimmt.    Besonders hervorheben möchten wir den sehr freundlichen Service der beiden jungen Mitarbeiter, welche uns von Anfang bis Ende mit herzlicher Freundlichkeit sehr gut betreut haben.    Die servierten Gerichte waren geschmacklich gut und schön präsentiert.    Das Restaurant Unter Deck haben wir auf die Liste unserer Lieblingsrestaurants in Hamburg gesetzt, und kommen auf jeden Fall wieder."
3,"Had steak menus here, twice, yummy! Nice service and a great atmosphere!"
4,"Great coffee, great price! The place is cozy and it knows what it's doing. Nothing more to say. Would definitely recommend to drop by!"
0,"The service was TERRIBLE and the food was mediocre at best. I had high expectations for this restaurant since they served American style breakfast. As a fellow American, I could have stayed home and made my own pancakes. Their pancakes were not moist and the chocolate chips were not cooked within the pancake. The sandwich my husband order could have been made in 10 minutes at most. It was just a sandwich with tomato, lettuce, and fake bacon. It took over 45 minutes to deliver our food! I'm not sure why this place has high ratings."
4,"First time in Germany and my boss recomended to visit this place after work. It reminded me of a quaint French Bistro that found its place in Germany. I ordered a glass of wine and the potato and leek soup. The soup was a great consistency and pretty filling. Don't forget the bread that was served, in which I asked for some olive oil. I was brought some sea salt that went well with my bread. If you want to relax with a nice glass of wine afterwork. Try Tati's Bistro!!!!"
4,"Das Restaurant is einfach genial! Sehr schön, wirklich leckeres Essen mit einer super Präsentation, und vor allem echt nette Bedinung!! Wir waren zur viert, zwie hatten nur ein Hauptgericht bestellt und die zwei andere Hauptgericht+Vorspeisen. Die Kellner sind einfach mit zwei extra Mini-Vorspeisen angekommen, damit die zwei mit Vorspeisen nicht allein essen. Das war einfach Klasse. Die Preise sind ein bisschen höher als normal. Wobei ist es nicht übertrieben für die Qualität vom Essen und vom Service! (ca. 18-25eur für ein Hauptgericht). Dieses Lokal ist wirklich zu emfehlen!"
3,"Thanks to the fab coffee connoisseurs of Yelp Hamburg--danke Euch nochmal!--, I received some great tips on where to go for my third-wave crave while staying in Hamburg.Public, located in Neustadt, was not too terribly far from our digs near the Hauptbahnhof.  We either took a mildly long walk to Public or a short U-Bahn ride; it was that easy.What initially struck me about Public was its atmosphere.  Relaxed and inviting comes to mind when I think of the set-up.  Public is a cosy yet hip spot with wooden tables and chairs, fresh flowers & wee potted cacti, and soft lighting.  Order at the counter, pay straight away or not, then take a seat.  It's just that easy.  If you've questions about the beans, the type of coffee drink you might wish to try, then do avail yourselves of the worker-owners.  They're putting a lot of 'herzblut' into keeping Public stellar and it shows.  Want to further your java knowledge?  Well, start by checking out the detailed 'coffee map' up on the wall to the right of the counter. -facts and figures galore!On one of my many visits, I spoke to a young man who, upon my telling him where I was from, seemed really receptive to my coffee queries.  Between making drinks he'd pop back 'round to my perch at the window and continue the coffee-chat.  I really enjoyed the interaction.  Chit-chat aside, the bevvies are top-notch.  The pastries are lovely, too.  Visitors and locals alike: a trip to Public is in order!Remember: WWJB?"
1,Too bad. I was not impressed. I had the Rotbarsch Filet. It was greatly disappointing. Absolutely no flavor. The portion was meager. There was a lot more Kartoffelsalat than fish on the plate. Definitely will not go again.
3,"Very nice experience!  The food was surprisingly fresh tasting for a chain.  The salad was good, I highly recommend when getting a sandwich or a soup (as I did) adding the salad for and extra euro.  Everything can be taken to go!  Something I have noticed becoming the ""new trend"" in gastronomy in Hamburg.  I can remember when even coffee was never served in a togo cup!Dean & David was great! Nice location and decor.  Free Wifi if you are looking for a nice place to get some work done!Check it out!"
4,I love Starbucks so much! This one has one of the best views I've ever seen and free Wi-Fi (log out and in again every 2 hours). Will def come back for more ice chai tea latte
2,"The number one selling point of Daniela bar is that it's busy at 3am on a Monday. Not many other bars can claim that. It's very popular and very small, and in my mind very much an ending bar - somewhere i'd only really go to because I wanted one more drink, and nowhere else was open."
2,"I love places where the barkeepers give meChocolate. And here the location is one of the best in hamburg.The cocktails look good and fresh. They are overloaded with fruit decoration, the stuff is fast and nice.Here comes the but, there's always a BUT:They have a big whisky menu but no real good whisky. The middle class whiskys are just super expensive. The toilets have a good design but they smell and give the impression of not being clean. But they looked clean.The music was very good, I was close to dancing :DConclusion: It's nice to go out if one doesn't want drink whisky, just cocktails."
3,"Another fabulous beach bar in Hamburg!Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and lots of tropical kitsch!This has more recliners than most other bars, unfortunately it also fills up quite quickly. The drinks at Del Mar are great, you have fantastic views over the harbour and can just sit back and relax and watch the ships go by. If you've never been to a beach bar or just need to relax after a long day, check out this spot!"
4,"Uns hat die 1. Platzierung im Zeit-Newsletter hier her gelockt! Und wir kommen ganz sicher wieder! Steht nicht gerade eine lange Schlange von Eisliebhabern vor der Tür, ist der Laden recht unscheinbar und schnell zu übersehen.Die Wartezeiten sind kurz, und sollte es doch mal etwas länger dauern - es lohnt sich!  Es gibt ca. 12 Eissorten zur Wahl, darunter Klassiker wie Stracciatella, Schoko, Nuss, etc. Eine Kugel kostet 1,10 Euro. Für meinen Geschmack hätten die Sorten etwas ausgefallener sein können, aber dann entdeckte ich das Spaghetti-Eis auf der Karte! Da musste es auch gleich die große Portion für 4,20 Euro sein. Gott, was für eine Eis-Offenbarung! Ich habe noch nie so ein geiles Spaghetti-Eis gegessen. Super sahnig-cremiges Eis mit leckerer Erdbeersauce, weißen Schokostreuseln und eine gute Portion Sahne unter dem Eis!   Eisliebe hat ganz verdient den 1. Platz unter den Top Eisdielen in Hamburg verdient!"
4,"This place really impressed me, the location is right in the heart of the city's Reeperbahn area. You can have live food cook right in front of you, it's a very novel way of eating which gives you a very different experience in eating. You can be as involved in your meal as you like or you can just let the chefs cook your food, there at 4 different stages and each one is excitingly good offering a wide variety of meats, even a Bar BQ section. Defiantly best to book first, as this place is very popular."
2,"Quick and cheap pizza to go. The dough is great, the toppings are lame."
0,"I have been to this place today after reading so many positive reviews about it. I had to drive all the way around 40 minutes on a rainy day. To make it short: the location at Steindamm 58 isn't the best or worst either, at least it didn't bother me at all. Even though my first impression was negative right after i entered this place, I queued up like others for the pos register. I ordered a so called jumbo durum for 5.00 euros even, and a beverage for 1.75 euros. I hat to stay in the queue to receive my order. While waiting I had the chance to observe that previously prepared various meat products were unsavorily displayed to customers despite being partially spoiled. But I stayed in the line, because the durums were allegedly prepared fresh. Finally it was my turn to get my order. The meal was a huge portion of a freshly baked  thin flatbread some cut of grilled ground meat with mixture of a salads. The meat wasn't hot enough, some parts  were not evenly cooked, some other still raw. I really was hungry, but couldn't swallow the first bite and had to immediately leave that horrible fast food place! Honestly I was extremely disappointed and wouldn't waste my time again, so to speak not even under any given circumstances..."
3,"A delightful restaurant.  We came here looking for a place to have a casual meal and drink whilst not being harrassed to keep buying more refreshments and could sit and chat without feeling like it was time to leave.There is the ground level restaurant which is rather snug the only table left was next to the toilet so we didn't fancy that (there is a reason no one sat there).  We were then told that downstairs has more space.  To get downstairs you come out of the restaurant and down the stairs from street level.  A cosy 'tavern' type place with plenty of space.  The waitress was happy and they were able to provide me with a English menu (yeah, I know..).  Food was simple but looked tasty and very reasonably priced I felt.  We opted for the recommended burger with fried potatoes (not chips as we know it).  Burger came and was huge with a nice bowl of friend potatoes.  The burger was delicious and can see why it was recommended. I didn't think I was very hungry but managed to eat every last morsel of food.We were able to stay there for hours without being harrassed.  Waitress was friendly and service was prompt I have not complaints about this place and it was a very reasonable price.  2 good size chicken burgers with all the trimmings and fried potatoes along with a few alcoholic drinks and 2 hot chocolates all for €31.00.  After that meal I was still feeling full and skipped breakfast the next morning!My only negative is that they do not take credit card payments and only cash.  Wise thing to know before going there."
4,"Really great experience, wonderful food and large portions, truly welcoming with the owner's  greeting and seating people. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
4,Love this place! Great burgers. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Asahi and saké with a Waygu Chesseburger and kimchi is hard to beat!
4,"Woohoo!!! Simply amazing...I decided to enjoy my dinner here with my parents, we had an amazing food experience!Everything is perfect! You start with a shrimps flambè, then two courses of fish/meat and dessert. Everything is so well presented and the cozy atmosphere let you enjoy a really good dinner!Reservation is suggested since the restaurant is quite small inside."
4,"It feels a little odd - writing a review about a bridge, but this bridge is no ordinary bridge. The Köhlbrandbrücke is a 3.5km long steel monster which leads from one part of the harbor to another. The bridge is perfect for a sightseeing tour. Accessible only to vehicles (no bicycles or pedestrians allowed on the bridge) driving over the Köhlbrandbrücke gives you an amazing view of Hamburg's harbor and a glimpse of the sheer size of the harbor district. The view from the Köhlbrandbrücke by day is a must-see for both tourists and residents interested in seeing more of Europe's 2nd largest harbor."
4,"This is a great place to go to if you want to see loads of sharks and other wild animals but my experience was pretty differant as i was there for Qype's 5th Birthday which was amazing.The hospitality was good as it was a champagne reception and nice food, but as the night went on it got better but maybe it was due to the unlimited bar tab lol but i would definatly go back and take my son for the sharks and other wild life."
3,"When in Hamburg, you eat a hamburger, right?We'd had a long and exciting morning, traveling from Lubeck all the way to the airport and back into town, and needed lunch as soon as we got into town.  We walked out of the metro station, saw this place, and agreed that it made sense.  The place was packed, even at 2pm on a Friday.  Our group of 3 sent 2 to get food while the third held space for us to sit when we got our food - yes, it was that busy. The menu was all in German but with pictures to make it easy to understand.  I got the burger with the extra tomato relish and arugula, along with fries.  Most meals come with the combo, and I chose the sparkling water.   You order at the counter and then wait for your food to come up.  They're cooking it fresh, so it did take a few minutes to get the food.  The burger was cooked well, but was still juicy.  The bun was a little weak, but since everyone in the room was eating with knife and fork, they didn't mind that it was falling apart.  I also liked the crisp fries, even without ketchup, which I didn't get since it cost extra.  Portion was large - good deal for a lunch in Europe."
4,"We were five in a group, everybody liked it, including picky German colleagues and as well picky Chinese. i am not in the position to compare it with other vegetarian restaurants, since i do not have many experiences. But as a restaurant, it is rather good. The sauce for rice, salad was made with care and delicacyyou can taste it! The price is in a budget-middle range, i just shortly glimpsed through the menu, many dishes cost around 11-14 Euro.Will definitely go there more often."
4,"This delicious Turkish lunch spot has to be one of my favorite, if not my favorite lunches in Hamburg. During the lunch hour (12:30 ownward) the line goes far out the door, so I recommend going early. From there, get your favorite kebab fillings. Other notables are the hot food bar and unlimited bread you can get while waiting in line.The all-German, very lengthy menu is a little tricky, but the good news is everything is delicious so you really can't go wrong.Cash only, so definitely don't show up waving your Visa around."
1,"I've been to many dim sum restaurants, including those in China, but this one missed the mark. The choices are quite limited and the taste of the dishes are ok-ish. The vegan buddharol for example was really chewy and greasy, instead of being crispy. The other dim sums were ok, but a bit on the small side. We also ordered fried noodles with Cha Sieuw, only there was not enough meat in the dish... the staff was constantly checking on you whether you are finished eating or drinking, which gave the diner a 'fast-food' feeling. The paent could only be done with cash or credit card, they didn't accept (EU) Maestro cards... Hamburg really needs a Chinatown."
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this yet. When I arrived in Hamburg I heard much about the history of Absinth bar, but wasn't able to go there as it had just shut down. However, daily I saw the guy trekking through the streets of Hamburg covered in brickdust, on the 1.5 year epic to refit the place. It was definitely worth it. Very very chic. Tasteful furniture and a minimalist wrought iron and glass bar. Cool. And they play jazz in here. Well, actually, of course they place jazz in here. It's cool. Like 60s cool. Old school cool. This is one of the best bars in Hamburg, so make sure you drop by. And don't drink anything other than absinth. One of the dev team disgraced themselves having a soft drink. Shocker."
4,"Came here for a very relaxing Sunday brunch with my man! Their menu changes daily as they use the freshest ingredients so don't be surprised if you can't find a menu!When you first enter, it may look a bit small but head on back past the kitchen where there's more seating and outdoor seating as well. We sat in the back in some comfy chairs. The decor of the place is so charming! Our waitress quickly greeted us and told us the daily specials and her recommendations. She was really nice and attentive! We ended up ordering the breakfast meal for one and added an order of their house made pancakes. I ordered a tea and was pleasantly surprised when the waitress popped out into the garden to pick fresh mint leaves for my tea!We started with a refreshing bowl of yogurt with fresh fruits and musli. Then our breakfast meal came which had everything you'd want for a brunch. There were various cold cuts of meats to choose from, cheese, caprese salad bites, some cucumber slices, olives, grapes, and jams and spreads for everything! We also got a basket of bread and a fresh hard boiled egg. Shortly after, our pancakes arrived and they looked fantastic! There was a bit of fruit jam drizzled on it with fresh mint and a chocolate spread and a maple sauce as accompaniments. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and tasted divine! Super fluffy and not eggy at all. Adding the mounds of the chocolate spread to it also helps with the deliciousness :)All in all, This was probably one of the better brunch experiences we have had this far being here. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are reasonable and the staff is also super friendly. Our brunch only cost us about 20€ so we'll be coming back soon to try more daily specials for sure!"
1,"No vegan or vegetarian food (even in the veggie ramen has fish inside), the edamame was less salty than it should be. My partner wasn't blown away with his noodles either.  Don't get me wrong it is a good place to be if you eat meat and like ramen. However, don't waste your time as vegetarian or vegan there."
1,"Update: we've been coming here for quite some time and I have to admit, I am getting a bit tired of the service mistakes made here. We were there recently and obviously they were not prepared for the rush which ensued due to the nice weather. Anyway, service was horrible. It took an hour for us to get our starters and then the main course came two minutes later, before we were anywhere near done with appetizers. Drinks took forever too and all around us, tables were complaining. I can understand being understaffed but the past three times we've eaten here, we've had issues with service, orders getting mixed up and things generally taking far too long, even when the place isn't packed. I may come back and update this post if the next time things get better but one more bad experience and I'm giving up on Chilli Club. The time may have come and gone where they focused on the customer.Cool place a bit out there locationwise. I wish it were more central but I guess at some point, the Hafen City will be hopping (at least I am sure all the investors in the Yuppie Island are wishing for)! Anyway, this is a modern, stylish restaurant, bar and lounge combo. They have Asian food and I've always had either sushi or the noodle thing they offer....can't remember the name. Taste great! Drinks are consistent and good, the atmoshpere is pretty laid back and on weekends full, so reserve. This is a place to go if you're looking to trudge on over here. At night, a very lonely place with no one around outside."
3,It was pretty amazing but you need to put hours aside to truly appreciate all the fine details.  We were only there a couple of hours and I found it interesting but did not have enough time to check out all the details.  I was pretty disappointed with their USA display but the European countries were absolutely beautiful!
3,"When in China, I learned that the quality of restaurants there does typically not correlate with its interior. So I wasn't worried that the ""Chinese am Fleet"" is located about as unpoetically as you can go in Hamburg, and oozes that cheap corner Chinese charme of decades lost. At the off time I visited, the only other customer was a Chinese-looking guy slurping his rice, which I took as a good omen as far as buy-in by the Chinese community at large.""Chinese am Fleet"" seems to cater to two kinds of customers: the lunch break crowd seeking hearty grub for 7€, and people craving authentic yet inexpensive Chinese dishes for a few more bucks (expect 12-16€ for most dishes). Second group, the first two pages in the menu are for you!There is much variety to choose from, with a spiciness warning for most of the authentic dishes. Portion sizes are very generous - obviously you'll have more fun as a group to share Chinese-style, otherwise this will likely be a very meat-focused experience. The pork belly dish I sampled tasted really good, rich and fatty as it should be, nicely seasoned.Don't worry too much about the spiciness warning - even at the highest rating, the food remains nicely edible. Thai nationals will still need to apply some extra chili.So - it's not the most authentic or best Chinese dining experience I had in Germany, but can more than hold its candle among Hamburg's everyday Chinese options."
3,"I thought this was a great choice for typical northern German dishes.  The dishes we ordered were well prepared, with good quality ingredients (especially the fish).  We tried  labskaus - it may be described in your guidebook as a kind of steak tartare, but this version seemed to be cooked with a bunch of interesting spices, then minced and/or pulverized into almost a paste.  Then it was topped with fried egg and served with beets and pickles.  Definitely uniquely Northern German (you won't find that in a Munich beer hall).   The other starter we ordered was a pea soup -- which was fantastically full of bacon.  For mains we had a flat-fish (like a flounder but I didn't catch the name), served smothered in small local shrimps, and a creamy fish stew, very nicely seasoned and served with potatoes that were absolutely perfectly cooked.  Service was very gracious too."
3,"The tour is interesting but only moderately though for young children. The tastig of chocolate you get to do is kept to a minimum but you get to make one bar of chocolate which you can decorate, lots of fun, BUT only for a full priced ticket, not for a child ticket which is totally NOT COOL!"
4,The food was amazing. So delicious!  I had the stuffed chicken leg. Fantastic. Husband ordered a simple salad and it was also delicious. Wine was rich and just what I wanted after a week of beer in Bavaria. Highly recommend.
3,"Just around the corner from my flat in Hamburg, this place is brilliant with a group or just on your own. I have eaten here a few times and its my favourite local. It does great Roast Potatoes and lovely Weissbier!"
2,Good to go with a friend. The cheapest Hendricks gin and Tonic I have found in Hamburg major plus! Shabby chic all the way and a really varied mix of clients.
4,One of the most beautiful places in this wonderful city.
3,"A very good experience in this restaurant. Before I came here, I expected a very hectic all you can eat eatery without any emphasis on ambiance and dining experience. I was wrong and wrong. The restaurant looked really well decorated and it provided a feeling of being in a bar rather than in a restaurant. The ambiance was really cozy, not too loud that people cannot talk to each other, and also not too quiet that people falling asleep. The order mechanism is really unique, as the others have mentioned. As I chose the all you can eat package, I was allowed to choose 5 dishes x 10 rounds (total 50 dishes per person), even though I stopped at round 5. Most of the food were of very high quality, especially the sushi roll and the nigiris, but some others were just so so. They have very good options of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), and I had weizen+ginger and weizen+lemongrass, which I really recommend. The all you can eat package was a little bit expensive at €25, but I think it was really worth it. My friend and I had a really good time there."
0,"Horrible food. Will never dare to order it again. I ordered the food online. So, can not comment on the ambience"
4,"Couldn't agree more with a lot of the reviews, definitely the best place to get currywurst in Hamburg. It was served in the traditional way, chopped up and with a fresh roll for mopping up all the yummy sauce. Rain or shine you can huddle round a table and awkwardly try and eat this delightful from a paper tray which pigeons swoop in around you. Not a gourmet dining experience but a must do in my opinion."
4,"if you visit hamburg, you must go to atlantik fisch! its definitely one of the best places in town to buy raw fish or to eat prepared fish. they offer delicious shells, salmon or backfischbrötchen inside and outside. in the summer months they have some tables out side between their custumers cars. forget the opening ours in this post. they are false. check their website for more current information concerning their opening hours"
3,"A nice spot for lunch or dinner and will be even better once the new Elbe Philharmonic Hall opens up,.  Carl is actually several restaurants sharing the same building - casual bistro, a more formal brasserie, and a private room and bar downstairs.  Went here for a group dinner at the Brasserie, and ordered a special 3 course dinner for 39 euros.  Each of the courses was well-prepared -  a salad, followed by steak, and then creme burlee, but perhaps not the most exciting preparations.  But the service and atmosphere made for a very enjoyable evening."
4,"A great new Irish pub in Deichstrasse. A great selection of beer and whiskey as the name would suggest. Live music, karaoke and live sports on tv add to the atmosphere. Definitely a great place to meet up and only a short walk from Rodingsmarkt U-Bahn station. Richard and the team give you a warm welcome and I look forward to going back many times."
2,"This is just another Asian in the line of those which are pretty far from original Asian food. Vegetable is not cooked enough, most of the dishes are way to spicy and place is mostly empty which makes it even more unatractive. Service staff is good but that's about it."
3,"My wife and I stopped off a Wednesday around 7PM and the tables were all full, so we grabbed seats at the bar. They had a happy hour running from 6-8PM and we grabbed some buy-one-get-one-free beer and ""atomic"" wings. They had Ratsherrn on tap, which is a local beer I really like. The atomic wings came out pretty quick and the staff was really curious about them. They are incredibly spicy, we did 3 wings each, and were nearly crying. But we like spicy, so it was good thing, but the wings are no joke. We moved on to our second and burgers. I had The Jack, medium-well, drenched with blue cheese. The fries were reasonable, just so-so, but the burger was huge and tasty. The burger buns are muffins, but it's a nice touch; they hold together pretty well, even covered in burger juice.Great place for a beer and a burger. They are really proud of their American beef and I could definitely taste the quality. The service was a little slow at times, but the staff was really friendly overall. I'd go back."
3,"Bok have built up quite a chain of restaurants around Hamburg. In Altona there are two and in Schanze I think they have 6(!). Obviously this means they're doing something right. The food is mostly Thai, but I think most of their places serve a variety of asian dishes. For instance there is normally some Sushi on the menu. This particular Bok is a self-service one - meaning that you queue at a counter, place and order and then wait for your number to come up. Personally I much prefer this to their restaurant experience. It's a bit cheaper, much faster, but just as good food. Hmm, I really should comment on the food. It's good without being great, if I'm honest. One of those places that you're always happy to eat at, but perhaps you're not going to go out of your way to go to."
2,"Very busy, quick service, friendly staff, yummy pizza ... Only thing they didn't have garlic bread and am also not used to dogs being allowed in restaurants. Will go back again if time permits."
4,"Best Arabic restaurant in town. Cheap and super tasteful! The service is awesome as well, such nice and friendly waiters!"
3,"Great food but a bit too crowded. The system there is really good, though: You get a streetname assigned to your order which is then called out when your food is ready to be picked up. No starbucksy name-guessing on both ends. The burgers are good, but not really spectacular. Too bad you can't upgrade the Pulled Beef burger to include more meat. Good value for the money, though. Not sure why they need plates, though. That being said, it definitely gives Jim Block definitely its own flair."
3,"The place is small and luckily we had a reservation, because it was very full (friday evening). In the end they even sent people away because there was no more food. However, the burgers were big and delicious. I had a vegan Burger with sweetpotatoe fries, both very good. We didn't have to wait long for the food and even though there was a lot going on, the waitress was really kind and not stressed. We felt very comfortable. Last but not least, prices are absolute appropriate!"
4,Great little place in Hafencity. Great food and great service. Nice place to sit outside on a sunny day with a glass of beer and watch the ships go by. Inside space is very limited.
3,"Even without trying any other dim sum restaurants in Hamburg, I'm pretty sure Mei Moon will be our go-to place for dim sum. The hubby and I stopped in after an afternoon of shopping, so we were famished. It was barely 6pm, so I'd like to think we avoided the dinner crowd. The restaurant, though down a small, alley-like street, was not hard to find. You can't miss the red signage. Mei Moon wouldn't be a true Chinese restaurant if they didn't have a giant menu, and this they did have indeed. We stuck with just the dim sum menu and already that was about 40+ items. We ordered 7 items, all of which were super tasty.My favorites included:- Rice roll with BBQ pork- Shark fin dumplings- Prawn dumpling with leeksProbably one of the best parts about the meal was the chili oil. Seriously. It was spicy as heck and very fragrant. Very different, in a good way, than the chili oil I've had at home in SF.Service was friendly, food came out pretty fast and pricing is pretty on par with dim sum places in SF. We look forward to coming back to try the other non-dim-sum offerings."
4,Wow. Simply delicious food & really excellent service. I was a single diner here during a business trip in Hamburg and will make a special effort to return every time I'm in Hamburg!
1,"To summarize:1. Friendly but the person plays with his iPhone all the time2. Food is not good. Phó --- is not good, because the meat seems not very fresh. 3. Would still recommend for people who never had Vietnamese food. Because the environment is not bad for hanging out with a group of friends ..."
1,"Sotiris ..... Well ...... It was quite an experience ..... A bad one, mostly.... Ok, maybe the food was let's say 'ok', and the prices were good, BUT ...a 'greek' restaurant with arabic decorations that the owner (or the manager, I wouldn't know for sure) treats a GREEK customer (that goes for the first time and very excited) like s*** ... well ... for sure I wouldn't go back .... I haven't experienced so rude behavior EVER. And even though I called from the hotel to do a reservation and told me it wasn't needed, I got there and they told me they were full booked. I waited (even though I should have left) and I sat with other 2 people I didn't know, after being asked -in greek- 'so,what do you want?' (!!!!!). They told me they'll change my seat later but didn't. Awful smell and treatment. Talk about 'greek hospitaliy' ... BS I say ... I'm guessing the participation (and publicity) from Adam Bousdoukos (Soul Kitchen movie) didn't help much, or if it did (as in my case) it won't help in the future. They need to learn some manners !!!!!"
2,"A pretty good and moderately priced Kebab restaurant in Sankt Georg. The location is quite nice if you're looking for something to eat before a screening at the Savoy theater. There are quite a few choices and the Dürüm that I ordered was quite tasty, but could've been a little fresher."
3,"Cool, hip and funky. We sat on sofas in the window and didn't want to get up!Reggae easing through the speakers, cold augustiner and friendly bar staff. We were immediately give a glass of free nibbles which is always an a+ in my book.Wanted to have a quick drink and then meet friends but that turned into a few drinks and a change of plans, friends came to us and we chilled out and watched as the sun went down and the area came to life.(One little note for the geeks: dyson airblade in the wc, for me its cool when places use up to date technology!!!)Go there, you wont regret it!!"
4,"Sure they started a bit shaky, but after a few months of working through the kinks and finding some great cooks these guys nailed it. Perfect food, casual attitude, good service, and good location. A+"
3,A bit of Berlin hipster style but I like it a lot. It's a good choice for brunch or a small lunch if you follow a vegetarian diet. Delicious coffee and what's more attractive is their awesome homemade cookies!
4,"This hidden gem is--hands down--the best Chinese & Dim Sum in Hamburg. The quality rivals my favorite places back in San Francisco. If you're looking for the Real Deal, this is it.The chefs/owners make their dim sum THEMSELVES--no deep-freezer factory-made dumplings here. And one tastes the difference immediately. We tried two types of Har Gao, Shu Mai, Rice-Crepe rolls, chicken feet, and wan tan soup. Everything was fresh and fantastic. Generous sizes, too.  The extensive menu features Hong Kong and Cantonese-style dishes. The decor is fun--strands of colorful lights complement the indoor waterfalls and gardens. Relaxed but nice.Can't wait to return and eat my way through the menu! :-)"
2,"Met with some friends here last week for some HAPPY HOUR cocktails.As far as I recall Happy Hour starts at 10:30pm / 22:30h.The prices for a Jumbo cocktail was about half the normal price which would be around 5-7€ depends on what you order. So normally it's around 12-14€ or something.Well the cocktails are really average. So it's still ok. While I was waiting at the bar, I already had in mind it wouldn't be the worlds best, since the best cocktails are from Brazil... well at least I like to think that way :DI have no idea about the food, but I know they have a very large brunch everyday for 10€ which is really good but you should still go to CAFE MAY if you want cheap and great brunch. So I wouldn't mind to try this place.And the location is really something. They have a large patio and the interior is neat and clean.I would come again for the location and try the food here."
4,"Just go to this restaurant. If you want to eat the food that's cooked in India, this is the place. We took chicken palak and okra thali and samosa as starters. Oh god! I never ate samosa taste like how it should be before I came here. The food was tasty, filling and quick. This is how you would probably eat at food corners in India. Go badshah!"
0,"NOT authentic pho!im asian and live in a viet heavy community so i knownoodles wrong type and broth is wrong flavorno tendon, tripe etceggrolls look like lumpiathis restaurant is scamming the german customers who dont know any better!"
3,"Wow, talk about cheap and plentiful food. I came close to the end of lunch time when most of the food was sold out! I ordered the fish of the day. They were out of potatoes and asked if pasta was OK. I was given a HEAPING plate of fish and spaghetti (like the entire box).  The fish was covered in a delicious, savory yellow sauce (the color of hollandaise but tasted different - better). There is no English menu but the host and chef were very sweet and accommodating. There is limited seating inside but plenty of outside seating. Highly highly recommend! My second best meal in Hamburg."
2,Nice Café Bar serving tasty green tea and some fresh selected kind of homemade pies. They were playing cool Music that made a charming atmosphere to our conversation. Quite affordable and almost a standard around the corner. During the Summer the garden is a blast in a students district like that. But somehow the waitress wasn't friendly... WTF ? I will be there again for a beer very soon.
1,"Super unimpressed with this place. We were expecting so much more since the concept was appealing and a bit of hype had been dispensed about this place. Unfortunately, the concept falls flat on its face. Currently still a trendy spot and hence fairly full at most meal times. We showed up and were given two cards and asked to wait at the bar. There is no system though to getting seated and people who came after us were seated before us. We also weren't given seats across from one another as requested but instead were seated next to one another in a bench seat area which was way too small to squeeze into as it was abutted up on to the wall next to it. Finally, once seated, everyone is so close that every word you utter is within earshot of six other people. Intimate seating for sure....if you want to be intimate with everyone around you. The ordering process is also quite inefficient. In hindsight, as two people, we should of ordered everything on one machine and with one card. Maybe that way the drinks would of come at the same time and thereafter the food. Instead we both used our own tablet and ended up having drinks and food all come at varied times. I was done with mine when my wife's arrived. Same with the burgers. Finally, the food ended up being OK. I've had far better burgers but these weren't necessarily bad. Yet they weren't anything more than mediocre when you take all the competition which has arrived on the scene in Hamburg. The drinks were also OK. Beer is beer but the home made ""drinks"" with creative uses of basil, etc. were a bit ""off"". Nevertheless, we experienced the place and are happy to have seen it but the experience fell flat and we won't be back."
4,"I always thought that burgers are something you get at McDonald's or Hesburger, but that changed when I came to Hamburg. Oma's Apotheke was the place i've tried my first real burger and I still can't find a place to top that. The staff is very welcome, interior is good, the food is great! What else do you need? :)"
3,"I got 2 words for you: Go there (on a sunny summer day of course)the view is amazingthe location is perfectright on the alster with a view of the sailing boats!really breathtakinghowever the waiters are 'so-lala', service could be better, but oh well, with such a view you don't really care, do you?"
0,"I went here for food last night. I'd been before but only for drinks so was looking forward to trying the food. The place was busy enough for a Sunday evening. Sat down at the table at 5:45 and ordered food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly enough but then it went downhill. At 7:00 we still had no food. Our waitress noticed this and went to find out about our food and came back to tell us they forgot our order! As our hunger levels were high and we were in such a bad mood with the service we asked for the bill for the drinks so we could go somewhere else. The waitress apologised and didn't charge us for the drinks. In fairness, I don't think it was all her fault. There wasn't enough staff working for the amount of people in the place. All the staff that were working looked stressed out and were running all over the place serving people. This might have had something to do with their rudeness! If they had more staff working things would probably run more smoothly. I've family and friends visiting Hamburg next month and wanted to take them here but I'm not going to now. It's a shame because the place is really nice and the food that I did see on other tables looked really good."
1,I had a family brunch here on Sunday.Good thing is that they have lego and toys for children to play near the entrance.
3,"Swedish restaurants are pretty rare, so I guess this one goes all in on being Swedish. First of all its logo is some kind of a Dala horse, a symbol of Sweden. And inside you have Lilla Åland chairs (well, fake replicas most likely), probably the most popular chair design from Sweden. So the atmosphere and interior makes me feel like I'm at home.I have only tried the meatballs here, and I like them. If you want a heavy meal and like potatoes, I think you'll like this place and its food too."
3,"Gourmet curry wurst, who knew? The place is a little out of the way and can easily be passed without noticing, but if you are a curry wurst fan it is certainly worth a try. It's small with seating only for a few small groups, but it's clean, cozy and the staff is super friendly. The menu is simple, but the undisputed favorite is the curry wurst with apricots and Belgian fries. Everything including the ketchup and mayonaise is homemade with high quality ingredients and you can taste it, it's simply 'lecker.'"
4,"Great donër! Unfortunately, it seems that everyone else in Hamburg agrees. Around lunch time, expect to have a half hour wait. We saw that one day and went somewhere else; came back to Kardelen at 2:00pm the next day and got food in under five minutes."
0,"This place is a no go.They might look like an Italian restaurant, they might act like an Italian restaurant, and they even actually be an Italian restaurant - just a really bad one. Maybe it's the lack of restaurants around or maybe it's just because they are just not good at what they do - they forgot the Italian hospitality and service.How come all the reviews are praising this place?!?!We came here in the afternoon, quite a big group and had a table reserved for us, the menu is a bit confusing as it's full of ads and weird articles.I really felt like having bolognese which is a must in Italian restaurants and they didn't have it, not in the menu and not in the specials. In addition - I had to ask twice for everything (took them 15 minutes to bring my very-not-tasty-from-cheap-syrup Apple juice.My pasta dish was very small, so small I left the place hungry, and not even offered me some Parmesan cheese.One positive thing - the garlic Aioli, which is great."
3,"An Argentinian Steakhouse is what they are going for here. It's a great spot with indoor and outdoor seating.For our appetizer, we went with the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp didn't seem the freshest and it was drowning in sauce so it was just ok.For our entrees, we naturally went with the steaks that came with a side of a baked potato with sour cream on it. We tried to order the steaks medium rare but the steaks were more on the rare side. That was fine by me, the flavors of the steak still came out very well. The ambiance is really nice, as its a bit darker inside and they have candles on all the tables. There seemed to be a birthday going on at a couple of tables away from us. It was really cute, they turned up the music and served the birthday boy dessert with a whole bunch of sparklers in it. Not sure if the family arranged that or if the restaurant does that usually for birthdays but it was cute.At the end of your meal, its nice that that they also offer you a little after dinner drink. We had the amaretto, which was a great end to our meal and nice to know that it was included and was not extra.I will be back whenever I have a craving for steaks soon!"
4,"It's a small menu, but the food is consistently yummy. Service is relatively quick for Germany, and has so far always been friendly and pleasant.Cocktails are *not* strong, but they are tasty - order for the taste, not the booze content. I recommend the red sake ...thing. Can't remember what it's called, but it's a sort of pomegranate-mint concoction. The tea is nice, too; the green tea is flavourful and comes in a generous bowl. The spring and summer rolls are always delicious. Always.You can't get a bigger, cheaper, better bowl of pho in Hamburg! I've had chicken, beef, pork, and tofu soups, and haven't had a bad bowl yet.Edit: if you're not in the mood for soup, get the bun cha (or bun something else) - crispy pork on warm noodles with cold veg and sauce to pour over it. So, so good, and quite filling. Oh! And their garlic-chili condiment sauce is so good you practically want to eat it with a spoon. I just shovel that stuff into the soup.Atmosphere is very casual, and if it gets crowded you may end up sharing a bench with strangers: it really is street-kitchen style. But that's not bad - it's very convivial. When the weather's cold and rainy, the windows all steam up and everything feels warm and friendly.This is one of the best places for lunch on a cold Hamburg day. Highly recommended! But note - it's cash only!"
3,Great coffee and cakes. Friendly and efficient service. Chic and stylish decor. I would definitely visit again if in town. It was also possible to eat dinner although we had other plans.
4,"The stuff there was really kind! Big portions, i tried 3 times. But I could never finish all  vegeterian burger with beans was really tasty! Worth trying."
2,"I was in town on business. I usually take the time to find the local Hard Rock to pick up a magnet from the shop if it is my first time in the city. This time I decided to stop into the restaurant for a late lunch as well.Location: An odd location in that it is not in the ""central"" Hamburg area. Unique, though, as it is within an old port building featuring great views of the port waterways.Food: Solid burger and ok beer selection. Portion was quite large, though, so come hungry.Service: Rather poor. I was there after the lunch rush and the restaurant was pretty empty. I figured I'd be in and out of there pretty quickly, but alas, not to be. My server was quick to the table when I first sat down, however, it was rather tough to get her attention once my food arrived. Spent more time chatting and laughing with the bar staff."
1,"Extremely dissapointing. We went there for a casual family dinner in the winter of 2016. The location is nice-harbour view. I am pretty sure that in summer, the restaurant will be a great attraction. The staff is very polite, atmosphere is neat, clean and stylish. However the food was not that great. Firstly, they gave some fresh warm bread with a tomato sauce, which was delicious. But then, the starter-Bouillabaisse was bland. No proper seasoning, taste, it was too watery. For entry, I ordered turbot wrapped in bacon and risotto. Risotto was well done, but the fish was raw, it was probably frozen. The vegetables next to it was just way too bitter and overcooked. I do not know why the vegetables turned out greyish brown, but there was way too much lemon and/or ginger that made it too bitter I think. I did not order any dessert, however I did tasted my mom's dish, which was creme brulee and white chocolate mousse. There was nothing special with the mousse. I wish they put some liquor to make it more interesting. The creme brulee was way too hard. The top must crack as soon as you hit it lightly with your spoon but we had to use some force. The taste of the dessert was alright, but in my opinion not being able to cook soup, fish, vegetables, creme brulee is simply dissapointing for this restaurant.In conclusion, I would only go to this place in summer, to drink wine or beer, to enjoy the view. I would not pay for the food."
3,"This is one of the numerous beach bars in Hamburg and one of my favourites.Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and of course outdoor heating!Wooden structures usually serve as large bars and most beach bars, including this one, serve a small selection of food as well. Though the real reason to come here is to stick your feet in the sand and slurp a cocktail or two. Many Hamburgers like to come to these bars after work to chill out a bit in the spring and summer. You can watch the industry harbour from here, which is a nice offset for the kitsch tropical decor of Strand Pauli. It's a brilliant place to grab a nice drink after a long day, though it does get crowded at times. As long as you can grab some comfy seating, just sit back and enjoy!"
3,"Surprisingly good food. Don't expect any kind of fine dining and the area is horrible outside the door.....it's gentrifying but still a good ways away from being hip. Nevertheless, the food is solid and tasty. Service is quite fast as well and by the amount of people coming in here, you can tell that you are not the first to find this restaurant. Also, the tin serving trays will remind you of prison food. We got a kick out of this but I am sure some people will be put off. Cleanliness is also not necessarily their forte. Note, I don't mean to say the place is dirty or unsanitary. It's simply not polished but in my opinion, that's fine. As long as the food is good, you don't worry about it being unfresh and the prices are fair, a great lunch spot. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to get here and there are other good Indian places in the area as well. If you live or work nearby as I do, definitely hit this place up. It's worth it."
3,"I really fancy this place! It is so typical Eimsbüttel! Be it for brunch or dinner, prices are proportional to the quality. Wine offer is short but good. Inventive dishes based on a classical menu with fresh seasonal products, excellent attentive service and the kind of crowd needed for Sunday night after sports. I just had Seeteufel, perfectly cooked served with tomatoes filled with ratatouille: delicious and beautiful! Otherwise the big salad with tuna fish is great as a reasonable dinner. Enjoy sitting outside if the weather allows it, and watch Eimsbüttel life around you.Avoid the pasta, on a second thought, apart from pasta with shrimps, I've eaten better pasta in my life But I can be pretty picky.English spoken, but not a surprise for the whole neighbourhood."
4,"This was the only Italian restaurant that was open late, so we decide to give it a try, and I'm really happy we did. I forgot to post this so I don't remember all of the dood we ate, but I do remember how fantastic the grilled calamari was. Everything was absolutely delicious."
2,"We went to Brauhaus Joh. Albrecht with four other guests for their last night in Hamburg and we wanted them to taste German dishes. We booked a table for 9pm. They took a while to take our order but the dishes went pretty fast. The dishes were what we expected and quite good. Then, we waited 30 minutes to order some desserts but they never came to ask, so we had to get up and ask them. After taking our order, they came back to tell us that the kitchen was closing so they couldn't serve us desserts. Hopefully, after repplied them that we waited 30 minutes for them to come and take our order, they agreed on doing it. The dishes were quite expensive regarding the service and the only thing they asked, was if we wanted to let a tip..."
2,"Five years I lived next door to Die kleine Konditorei. I could have had these great rolls every day. Every morning and every evening.I could have hadBut I didn't have them every day. Not even weekly. The rolls are okay, but in my opinion it's not the manifestation of rolls worldwide there. Standing in line can be fun, I don't have to tell you. But standing in line over the street for rolls ? Only if you need buying rolls as your first event on a sunny sunday morning. So, dear English-Qype-Community, toast is all right and breakfast without rolls is all right too, even in Germany. But if you are homesick and you want to stand in queue you are welcome!"
4,"What a great little cafe. Just stumbled upon it today with an acquaintance who recommended we stop in for an espresso. We ended up having a piece of homemade cake and this was fantastic. The majority of things sold here homemade and everything looks spectacular. The primary goal of the place is to sell tidewood but I think they do more business as a cafe. If you can find it, definately make sure to stop in. Although we had very little to do with the service personnel, it seems like everyone there was really nice. People were also hanging out there during the middle of the day, in a workweek. Seems like an awesome place to stop in for a coffee and just enjoy time passing by."
3,"I ate it at 2 a.m., not drunk, and didn't feel like crap! YAY! Great bratwurst and fries, wolfed it down like starving dog and was fully satisfied. Can definitely recommend for the late night munchies or the drunkie munchies, whatever you prefer."
2,"The food here is simply excellent.HOWEVER, the service is arrogant and unfriendly to say the least. Be prepared to be treated dismissively and rudely."
2,"The atmosphere here is certainly very pleasant. Staff is friendly, the restaurant is very nicely decorated, noise level is unobtrusive, etc.The food is, well, overpriced, just like others have already stated - think roughly 15 Euros for a vegetarian meal and about 18 for a meat dish.The focus here is on appearance and on sauce. Thus, you will receive a dish that looks visually stunning - but there won't be much to it. In essence, you will receive whatever your chosen main ingredient is, doused in a sauce.It's fine, but it's completely overpriced for what you get. You can apply this rule to just about any dish we ordered. Tofu and Chili? It's really just fried tofu and and a few slices of chili pepper in a spicy sauce. Would it have hurt them to add a few veggies? Of course, you might say that the food is exactly what the description says - and that is certainly true. However, I do NOT find this to be true at any of the rather many Thai restaurants I've eaten at around the globe. Maybe it's a German thing?The red curry followed the same principle - there was, however, a tiny bit of variation in it. We counted four peas. Three halves of mushrooms. Some carrot slices. And lots of cabbage. That seemed a bit lame. Alas, you know what took the cake: Mini Corn out of jar!!! I have no idea who in their right mind still uses mini corn in any dish, let alone a Thai dish - all I know is that's it's a big N O.Overall, our experience was nice - but this restaurant is not really up to snuff. I think Germany is still desperately trying to incorporate it's ""multi-kulti"" aspirations in the culinary scene - and things are improving. For now, the German palate still has not reached a comprehensive understanding of the wide array of food that is available. Sure, each cuisine is tailored to local tastes anywhere in the world - and that ""customization"" can be offensive if you expect ""authentic."" It's akin to eating Chinese food in Latin America. Or  ""Mexican"" in Germany (I've tried - I don't think that really exists).So, if you want Thai, then this is certainly acceptable. Don't expect to get any real Thai food - expect a bare minimum that caters to the German palate. It's close enough for now.I don't think I would go back. There are, quite apparently, better venues to be tried."
4,"This place has great coffee! The food was fresh and quick and very reasonably priced. The staff were friendly and efficient. Plus, they allow dogs!"
3,"There's a reason this Hamburg Chinese restaurant has such a large Chinese, Thai, Filipino clientele; it's the real deal done well.  Reasonably priced lunch specials, good portions, tasty food, and comfortable seating are the pros.  Don't let some of the surly staff or sublevel dwelling deter you.  You're bound to leave feeling you have achieved preiswert!"
4,"extremst leckeres, weil ganz arg ehrliches, essen. das carpaccio perfekt und der pfannfisch der hammer. jetzt noch apfelpfannkuchen mit vanilleeis als nachtisch und ich schlaf ein wie ein baby! danke und bis zum nächsten mal"
3,"L'osteria is a nice and stylish restaurant opposite of the opera. The pizzas are pretty big and very tasty. The pasta dish was ok. The staff was nice but forgot some drinks and we had to wait pretty long for the drinks. A nice feature was an Italian audio played in the restroom, which taught how to make a restaurant reservation in Italian.The entrance was even with the ground."
3,"This place deserves four solid stars for its unbeatable location only: Hirschpark is one of the most enjoyable and pretty parks in Hamburg. And what can be better to take a stroll after fulfilling and hearty brunch on Sunday afternoon! The brunch itself was not outstanding: you will find a standard selection of warm and cold dishes, not too much and not too little. The bread selection was a bit disappointing, with no wholemeal buns selection, to which you get used to so quick while living in Germany. On the other hand a really good selection of deserts. Interior is very old fashioned, you absolutely feel that you are in a traditional Landhaus. Therefore a lot of old customers. Prices are not cheap: you'll pay 19 eur, drinks excluded. Keep in mind that tables for brunch are booked quickly. Would I suggest this place? Yes, if you want a quiet meal, opportunity to chat and no hassle. There was my mom, my boyfriend and me brunching together - now you got the idea :)"
3,Nice place for a no fuss no frills stop. Definitely a nice place to read and enjoy a cuppa. Their vanilla latte is heavenly.
4,"Very refined mom and pop shop with a limited but delicious menu that has all the Hamburg classics. I reserved a table via email three weeks before Mother's Day to get a spot for dinner with my family. A little old school but I can respect it. We came in and filled the last table-the place was already so lively at 6:30 on a Sunday (Mother's Day). They have English menus and were (of course) offering an asparagus specialty menu. We went with a couple beers, a shandy, a Schnitzel, mixed fish plate and the whole fish. Everything was so delicious and we could see the singular chef working and the singular woman wait all the tables. The only thing was that the shandy was actually made on site, with sprite and beer from tap. It was an interesting flavor. Would recommend this to anyone to get Hamburg classics!"
1,"Oh Lord, seriously, it's not that good, pretty below-average actually.For starters the food is expensive, and quality wise no better than average. What made things worse is that my vegetables were cold, so were my colleague's, and that made for a pretty crappy meal. I wonder what sort of system they have in the kitchen where the veggies end up cold by the time you get your plate.We sat outside and I thought the service was fairly inattentive, you really had to gesticulate to try and catch a waiter - the Greek restaurant to the right Olympisches Feuer, on the other hand are much more attentive, and is a better bet for a nicer meal.Lastly I ordered a Sagres from tap and it just didn't taste right. It was carbonated, but I suspect perhaps the lines hadn't been cleaner properly - it just had an off taste that made my stomach start to turn, you know, as if you had a bit of bacteria you didn't want to have. Nothing major, you get that as a beer drinker, but, not very good quality sadly, and I thought that Sagres being a Portuguese beer (as far as I know) would have at least tasted good from a Portuguese restaurant.It's another one of those cases where they have a great location on ""the strip"" and they don't have to make an effort, and people still come and eat there.Look I agree the location is nice.  But seriously go to the Olympisches Feuer just to the right, the service, food, value is all a touch better and you'l still be on the strip."
3,Always go here when in hamburg. It's god great schnitzel which is always good. Nice location overlooking the canal in central hamburg. Only issue with the place is the service is painfully slow. Been here 3 times now and every time had to ask a few times for a beer or a table or a menu. They seem to be always busy so service is not something they have dealt with. Great place otherwise though and always a good atmosphere.
4,"Cozy interior, outdoor seating, very nice staff and relaxed atmosphere. And most importantly - delicious food!! We've tried 4 different dishes so far and they were all really high quality and very well made!"
4,"This place is the shiznet! It's loungy and bar-like, yet good enough to bring your kids along. We did indeed bring our boys here. The waitress/bartender was awesome and spoke very English very well.  Th food - Turkish style middle eastern was great. Kids had a burger and falafel. Wife and I had Doner(Gyro basically). All that and drinks for the kids and 5 drinks for us(yeah kids drove ya crazy today - don't judge) - $55 Euros. I overtipped the waitress because the kids were being little twerps, over tired from a long day. She really did a fantastic job though."
4,"CASA FRANCO FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I came here twice with the company I was working for. Since my boss always paid for everything.BUT I'M SURE IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE :D I think if I'd know the prices, I would pretty much give it ZERO stars hahahah. kidding :)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, what we always got was:HUGE SCAMPIES ROASTET IN OIL + ALCOHOL served in huge flamesA PLATE WITH DIFFERENT FISH FILETS + a unique secret sauce made by FrancoSTEAK, small peaces of steak with different sauces.and more.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Honestly I don't remember it all but I know you get a lot, and all the seafood you get are really really delicious.I remember I dropped the whole steak I picked it up and still ate it, that's how good it was. But I was drunk anyways haha.LOCATION: Very very small, I guess about 20 people max. It's great, because it gives you a nice familiar cozy atmosphere.If you have the money and wanna do yourself somethiing good. Come here."
3,'raw like sushi' offers a great choice of sushi and bentos besides having lovely deserts. Important: the sushi not just standard maki & co but somewhat creative! These facts and the good atmosphere make this place a good alternative to the growing number of sushi place in Hamburg and is definitely worth a try.
4,"Chocolate Museum Tour is normally in German but the entire group spoke English so thank goodness the guide was able to do it in English. Made our own chocolate bars, learned about the fascinating history and process of how cocoa is produced and eventually made into the sweet sweet chocolate we know today. Worth the money! Loved learning about all of the history and procedures/stages of making chocolate."
4,"Easily one of the best authentic Korean restaurants outside of Seoul. A pure, honest delivery of everything I adore about Korean cuisine.I ate here every lunch for a week, and sampled a broad range of items and found it all good.The Kimchi Jjigae is punchy, spicy and enriched with belly pork and pork broth. Loaded with flavorful kimchi and presented with a bowl of rice and 3 banchan, this was a must have staple for me at every meal.The pork bulgolgi was tasty, spicy, and fatty--perfect for stirring into rice and more banchan.The djajiangmein was a surprisingly pleasing bowl of spring udon like noodles, earthy slightly sweet black bean paste, and little morsels of pork to give depth and rounded mouth feel.Bibimbap was accompanied by fiery Gochujang sauce and loads of banchan vegetables.Service is friendly and quick--walk all the way in to the end of the bar to place your orders for lunch. Reservations necessary at night--especially on the weekends! They are fully booked for good reason."
3,"Not the best quality of food, great deal nonetheless. For €4,50 you can get a jumbo Döner. If you're looking for good, fast, cheap food. I would go to Batman the Restaurant."
3,"A great find! It's a small cozy place on a nice street. Really warm on a cold snowy night. They have 3 options for vegan spätzle which I was really craving. They recommended the ""cheese"" and onion one as the most traditional and I got it with smoked tofu as an option. It starts with a small side salad but then when the spätzle came out it was huge! It comes in a glass baking dish straight from the oven. The vegan ""cheese"" was really creamy. It was a bit of a struggle to finish it but it was so good! The staff were really friendly with perfect English. I'll definitely head back when I'm in Hamburg."
4,"The food is authentic and high quality. The restaurant is very well decorated and the staff are friendly. Best of all, they serve food that would be served in Vietnam. Very authentic! I highly recommend this restaurant!"
3,"We had a nice dinner in this Turkish restaurant yesterday night. Everything started kind of meh because we had to go tell Ikea to f****** deliver all the stuff that they should have delivered. But this is a story that I'll tell in a separate review. Once we were out of the blue monster, we were in need of some sustenance. I remembered walking past this large Turkish restaurant which looked promising, so I brought us there. The location is right next to the Altona Bahnhof, so convenient to come with the S1.Even though the restaurant was quite busy, we were seated right away. All the dishes on the menu have pictures, so just point to whatever looks good. For me it was the Döner Teller mit Kalb for € 8,50. There was no beer on the menu (or I couldn't find it), so I picked the closest thing, a big Apfelschorle. It certainly looked like a beer when it arrived with a nice beer head.The food was very tasty. The Döner meat was grilled and tasty and all the sides (yogurt, tomato, cucumber, onion, rice, etc.) were very good as well. There was plenty of food, enough to make me wonder whether I should take some home. But I powered on and finished my whole plate.Service was nice and attentive, I just wished our drinks arrived a little bit faster than they did."
3,The BallinStadt Auswanderermuseum is located close to Veddel S-Bahn Station at the old location where the emigrants stayed before the left for their new lives. The museum explains the lives of the emigrants in Hamburg and shows where they emigrated to. It is also possible to search for ancestors but I was a bit disappointed that there was not a good explanation how to search.
3,"Very tasty semi-upscale food. price is ok. But for real upscale, I had better. Good service. Portions are a bit small. But thats the upscale- thing. Four stars. I do not have complaints, but I think they are trying to be something they are. not quite. Its good, but something is missing."
3,Ordered the thämer burger with fries and 2 half pints of beers. Can't get better than that!
4,Great little place! Could easily compete with high end burger places in the US. The owner was super nice as well. The doctor had a Banksy style to it. Go here if you are craving a quality modern burger.
1,"I'm mean really guys- 4 beers two burgers and some Nachos = €75 or something - really...?Burger were OK - Buns were a disgrace , Nachos - Good!- Staff had to be reminded three times of the empty beer glasses and a new order  !-but they were friendly!I'm travelling world wide - always end up in some hard rock cafe, since all the folks find it sooo cool - LAME!Hey, they played German Electro beats at the Hardrock cafe Hamburg - That has NOTHING to do with Hard Rock - play Rock - or actually Hard Rock, hence the name-Only tourists - not one person from HH in there.Just a big corporation trying to sell some shirts for € 20-40 a pop- Nothing to see here , move on!"
2,"Very friendly staff, they made us feel very welcome and we were even drinking shots together.The starter was great, the overall fish quality was very good. However, they serve the fish with very flavoured sauces which don't suit the great fish quality. We've recommended them to serve the sauce on the side rather than on top of the fish.Also a bit expensive, 2 people - 100€ for menu and bottle of wine."
3,"Oma's pork schnitzel with fried bacon & onion bits is possibly my favourite thing to eat in Hamburg, and as they also serve Duckstein then you can't go wrong with a visit here. The portions also managed to keep 8 very hungry skateboarders appetites sated on my last trip over, and also the veggie option was a winner with our token vegetarian.I try and eat here at least once every visit, and I've also had a good night propping up the bar sampling the beers. Visit!!"
1,"Unfortunately it's only in German. It feels a little uncoordinated when walking through the museum. There's just a lot of text/information everywhere. It was cool to see and I got a little information brochure in English, still I think such a museum, especially in such an international city like Hamburg, should offer it in both languages, German and English."
3,Such a sweet little cafe with awesome cakes. But the vegan range was quite small unfortunately. The mint and ginger tea was great anyway :) thanks for having us !
3,"We enjoyed an early dinner at Campo da Franco on a recent Saturday evening. The weather was great, so we sat outdoors in their patio, which despite being adjacent to a major thoroughfare, was fairly quiet and calm. The staff is super-friendly; we mostly communicated in German, but they were there to help us in English when we stumbled. The crew seems legit Italian, and they do a nice job. I had the eponymous Pizza Campo (arugula, spicy salami, cherry tomatoes, Parmesan), and it was delicious. Also had some insalata caprese on the side, which was very fresh and tasty. My family also enjoyed their meals, and we had some nice wines by the glass to go with everything. All in all, a great experience with good food. We'll be back."
2,"I was positively surprised by the many different dishes you can order, even though sometimes further detailed descriptions may help you figuring out what to eat. Waiters were friendly, what actually persuaded me into rating three stars is the fact that portions are a bit disappointing in terms of quantity and that people were loud, also payment with cash card is not supported, anyway i'm definitely going again! Dishes tasted really good."
4,Xiao Xang Garten is a really wonderful restaurant situated in Elmsbüttel in Hamburg. The staff is very much considerate with the diners and very friendly and professional. We were invited by German friends who made us discover this most pleasant place. All the dishes we had were excellent. We strongly and heartily recommend this Chinese restaurant which is very quiet and intimate.Michel and Marie Moulin Lyon France
4,"Best pizza in Hamburg, and not exorbitantly priced. Their salsiccia pizza is amazing."
4,"Just finish classes at Colon Language School? Go to this small basement restaurant called ""Delikatessen des Meeres"" two buildings away. There's no menu. The chef cooks one dish per day and varies daily, depending on what's freshly supplied on the day. Sometimes shrimps with potatoes, sometimes salmon spaghetti with mustard sauce to die for. EUR 5,50 each. Portion is humungous. You'll drop your jaw to pay so little for such quality food. Fresh!! Waiting time is long, between 20-40 mins during lunch. You will be told the number of bell ring to collect your plate. Sitting is limited to indoor area, can get quite narrow during winter. Great ambient to eat with Opera and Classical music. Food cooked with love. Best time to go: Summer before or after lunch-time (waiting time 5-10 mins)! There's many sitting area outdoor. My perfect place to chill out under sunshine in Summer!!! Best goes with a glass of wine for EUR 3,50... hmm, maybe two..."
1,"Meh. Food was ok at best. Find it weird they roll their burritos all in the morning, my friend tried to order one without chili sauce and because of said rolling, this wasn't possible. Overhyped. They try to give off this whole ""oh you didn't reserve vibe, well we are too good for you."" Kinda vibe. Blah I'll deal with said nuances of food is amazing, but again, is nothing to go nuts about."
3,"One of my favorite Schwarma places in Hamburg. It's a little small inside (25-35 ppl) but nice and friendly. The workers are friendly, too. I don't eat other things there so I can't say much about that food, but Schwarmas taste perfect The range of food isn't that big, but definitely enough to choose from.The only thing I don't like that much are the toilets. You have to go behind the counter to go downstairs and the cabinets are really small. All in all nice place to go!"
2,"Came here with work colleagues for something to eat.  As it was a nice day, we sat outside.  A casual arrangement on benches which means you may have to share a table with others but this is part of the atmosphere.  Of course the outside is probably more popular with the smokers so us non-smokers have to suffer the odd whiff of smoke in our direction.  A popular social area, there are street performers so if you are lucky you may get some live music as you dine.  Down side is that you can also get approached by beggars.Extensive menu of Japanese food from sushi, curries, noodles, rice dishes etc,  I think you would be hard pushed not to find something to eat.I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki which was nice if not a little too salty with a little too much sauce.  Nevertheless I ate it all.  My sushi loving companion loved their sushi dish.No pressure to move on once you have finished and so you can chill out with a beer after you have eaten also.Staff friendly (menus in German but then I didn't ask for an English one) and good value for money €65 for 4 of us with drinks and tip in that price."
2,"This place was mobbed when we ventured in on a cold Tuesday night in March. We had been looking for somewhere to a have quick drink with a decent atmosphere and it fitted the bill. Named after a gangster from America during the 1920's the place had photos of him everywhere. It was was also dark and moody looking, set up to be like a cocktail bar that a mobster might frequent.In terms of a place to have a drink this could well have been a 4 star as it was busy, had some atmosphere, attentive service and a good array of drink options. For two main reasons for me it is only a three star. Firstly they allow smoking inside. For me it is now a very much out dated practise that no way should be allowed inside bars. Secondly the drinks were a bit on the pricey side working out at 27 euros for three. So works out about £7 a drink, which is pricey compared to other places in the city. If these two things don't bother you I reckon you will love it here. Decent cocktail bar, certainly busy on a Tuesday night."
4,"It's bigger inside than it seems, many white tables, and fully booked at dinnertime. Don't come without a reservation.Food and service are superb here; a confidently limited set of dishes, creative food without going overboard, generous portions, and not too expensive for what you get either. Everything feels pleasantly un-rushed, making this a nice place to dine out with a little time.Same goes for the wines: a very tasteful selection, and all sized and priced so you'll be happy to order more.Nailed it, don't change the concept! :)"
4,"Priceless and a must do when in Hamburg... The park is amazing to walk around, go grilling or just jump into the water...."
4,"I have had turkish food all over turkey and this place is just as good. A long line to order lunch but once I got through that, i ended up getting the chicken donner plate and it was legit. The rice had the needed texture/softness and the chicken was moist but not soggy. Outside of the kebabs I ate staring at the Galata bridge in Istanbul, this place is it. I guess come around 1PM if you want to avoid the lunch rush."
4,Delicious food & fantastic service! Perfect place to eat with a baby too as the service is excellent and accommodating for all needs.
4,"When I first came here just over a year ago I was shocked that such a place existed in Hamburg. It's really great, but I can't imagine coming here much more than once a year.. playing sports in soft sand is just too tiring! Both of my visits here have been for a beach football competition. The first time I was injured and so hung around drinking beer all day. More recently (last weekend) I was playing and I'm still feeling the pain. Beach football is dangerous! Still, it's a great asset for Hamburg to have such a facility."
3,"Danmark Snack is basically just hotdogs and burgers, but mostly hotdogs. It's a very unassuming little place, and so for the past year I'd always just walked on by to one of the other fast-food places. I had noticed that it's well reviewed here by German Qypers, and so when leaving the Reeperbahn S-Bahn hungry last night I popped in. The place is basically a hotdog factory, but they also have a few burgers if you want one of those. I went for a cheeseburger and it hit the spot. Not too big, not too small. it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was better than most of what is on offer at other nearby establishments."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised today when I was brought in by my Qype colleagues to this asian looking little gem called the Loving Hut. Me and my 2 words of German were glad to see we were going into familiar grounds: an English name, surely an English menu, right? Yes! I ordered the Curry which was pretty nice which came with either soup or spring rolls as appetizers for a mere EUR7. I'm not vegan in any way although I like the concept. In fact I could consider myself a 'vegan-virgin' before today (I really do love my beef burgers) but the dish was really tasty, definitely filling and left me wanting to try a new one sometime soon. Judging by one of the Qypers below, we got the best spot in da' place too!! The one and only round table in the back!"
3,"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I came in during the downtime and got my burger relatively quickly. The atmosphere was relaxing and the burger itself was quite juicy and full of flavor. The fries were pretty fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside - always nice, and having mayonnaise and ketchup for free was a plus. The milk shake I ordered was alright and I was all in all pleased with everything."
4,"This place is amazing for a rainy day! So much detail. So many great things to look at, so overwhelming but stick with it."
3,"Nice little park between Hoheluft-Ost and Harvesthude. There's lots of space to picnic here on a sunny afternoon, benches to lay on and enjoy the sun and plenty of room to play ball and barbeque. The park itself is circular, so taking walks around the park lead you straight where you started off :)"
3,"i am visiting vesper since few months. it has an elegant decorative style, large windows give a lot and make the place comfortably spacious, home-made good quality cakes are always delicious... the service crew is precise and very friendly, they make no mistakes. I had few times dinner and i was not disappointed."
4,We went last night while on a visit to Hamburg.  It is off the beaten path but worth the walk.  Our 82 mother on a birthday trip requested traditional German food particularly specials of the Hamburg area.  Thamers did not disappoint.  We all started with beer (of course) and she ordered up the Krabben.  I ordered blackfisch and big guy wanted Wienersnitzel as we generally only have it when we are visiting Germany.  We fancy ourselves bratkartoffeln snobs as we have had excellent and not so good.  Thämer's was some of the best. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend.
4,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Hamburg. Excellent coffee, warm service and a tiny discount if you bring your own cup :))"
4,"Best. Schnitzel. Ever. This was my birthday dinner, and it was perfect. The restaurant is a bar and a room for roughly 24 people. No reservations. Waiting is standing room only. But it was worth it. Very much worth it. We both ordered the Schnitzel - since we did not want to share. Their wine selection is small but very good as well. I tried a few of their whites by the glass. Portions were perfect and the room was cheery and warm.Next time I will save room for dessert."
4,"As a third wave coffee shop lover, I believe this is also one the bests in Hamburg. In ""Portugiesenviertel"" area of Hamburg-which is full with tourists and tourist traps, this is certainly the best coffee place.The coffee quality and how it's prepared is exactly how I like. I do ask what kind of coffee I'm getting (prefer to be surprised but I think you can choose it too). And I get proper answers proving me that they know what they're doing. It's a calm place where you can make a pause ""in silence"" and read your stuff -inside or if it's sunny outside- and taste a good flatwhite with micro foam. The atmosphere seems just a bit cold and reminding me Scandinavian style minimalistic places (I lived in Stockholm). I think it was a dairy store before and they haven't even changed the facade, I enjoy it. The service at the bar is also kind, another reason which makes me go back there again and again. But first reason is the tasty bitter fresh coffee-"
4,"This is not my first time to visit them, but a first on a weekend. The service is still very good & it all arrive on a timely manner inspite being full house. They have a nice selection of drinks for both alcoholic & non-alcoholic drinker. Definitely will go back !!"
4,"Amazing. Menu is short  - like in very good restaurants. I tried Lamb and Sea bass, both were delicious. Note: they accept only chip cards."
4,Ticks all the right boxes. Decent range of Asian dishes at affordable prices. Big portions and always excellent customer service. I'm a regular and a big fan.
1,"Terrible service for breakfast, atmosphere is loud and unruly, you usually can't really hold a conversation without practically shouting at each other. We just tried to order breakfast though and they just didn't take our orders, we tried making notice of us in between after she actually cleared our table and told us she'll be back as soon as possible to take orders but didn't come back at all, after 25min and trying to order 2 times we decided to call it a day and left for a different cafe. Definitely not going there again, prices are okay though and I guess I'd recommend it on a less busy day."
4,Awesome! Wonderful food and Benny was a great server to us. So hospitable and down to earth Would come back here often.
3,"Decent beach club which has the novelty of not being by the river, but actually in the centre of the Schanze, so you can go anytime. On the downside, it's not actually near the river... so... you can't see any boats. You get my drift. Come here in summer and bring flip flops. Don't even think of coming without them! The owner is pretty friendly and sorted the Qype team all out with free drinks bands even given our no-notice of a party of 20. They do basic food, chips, bratwurst etc, and it's laid back drinking. Nice. And that's my thousandth review!"
4,Possibly the best Italian food I've ever eaten. We had the set 3 course menu for EUR39.95  starter of a prawn salad on beetroot carpaccio followed by veal with mushrooms in a truffle sauce. An amazing panna cotta with fruit to finish. To top this we had a table with a great view of the harbour. It's not somewhere I would normally eat but great for a special occasion.
2,"Cute small coffee shop in EimsbuettelThe Speisekammer is a cute place to enjoy breakfast in the morning or a slice of cake in the afternoon.During nice weather you can watch pedestrians from their small patio or if it is too cold or rainy relax behind their large window front or upstairs where they also have a small kids corner.The cake is fantastic, the service a little slow. However, if you are not in a rush it is a good coffee shop to spend some time.+ delicious cake+ good coffee - slow service (bring some time and patience)Credit cards accepted."
3,"Reservations are suggested but they were still able to seat our party of 4 when we walked in. The menu is in German. We enjoyed fricassee of chicken, white asparagus (seasonal item here) with ham, and German beer and wine. You pay for water which is served in a glass bottle (natural or still means without carbonated bubbles). We appreciated that they notified us that they were out of certain menu items and had substitutes to offer (i.e. alternate beef and fish entrees)."
4,"Cafe Mimosa is a great little St. Pauli breakfast spot. There are two main options; cheese & meat or lots of cheese and both are great. The cheese breakfast comes with brie, goats cheese, mozzarella with tomato & balsamic vinegar, cream cheese, some other cheese, grapes, butter, jam, two slices of homemade bread, a bun and a coffee. Basically everything on the plate is of the highest quality, and they give you the perfect amount, so that you'll finish everything, but not want more. The cheese & meat option is the same except you swap the goats cheese & mozzarella for palma ham and some good quality salami. Great value at EUR6."
3,Really good food. Service was slow but other wise OK. The biggest downside was the lack of English menu.
2,"A typical ice cream shop with a pretty large selection of your basic and expected flavors. It was good, but with so much competition in the area (Eishunger, Cellos...), this would probably be my last pick on Mühlenkamp to get a scoop in the future. If they had more interesting flavors or more attractive prices, then I'd come back!"
4,"I've known this place for years, since when it first opened, then with the expansion, and to me it represents something beyond great food, beyond incredible success.  It is simply a brilliant operation.  If you order a durum doener for take out, and stand by the kitchen counter, it is like watching the movements of a Swiss watch - - but no watch part ever handed you one of the best doeners anywhere (superb balance of toothy vegetables, onion, and meat) with such a warm smile, and such care.  The in-house meals are superb value - - such a great spread of wonderful substances and delicious flavors.   The semi-outrageous colors, the constant bustle, the thoughtfulness and graciousness of the extremely busy staff - - it's no wonder that even after the expansion, this place is packed no matter when you go (mostly with Turks in the know).   Incredibly handy location right next to Altona Bhf.  It is one of a kind, and it is a kind worth enjoying often."
4,"Epitome of Hamburger Berg. It has it all: coolness, attitude, tunes, drinks Music is great. It can get very crowded on the dancefloor. But that's exactly what I like about it: people come to have fun and shake their bones to their favourite beats. It's as simple as that. My favourite @Reeperbahn"
4,"Great location situated in a boat moored on the harbour side. Tables at windows have great views. Good breakfast of bread roles,  cheese,  meats, egg and great coffee. Must be one of he best locations in Hamburg for breakfast."
4,Amazing food made fresh. The aroma alone from the outside is enough to attract people to this restaurant. That's how my wife and I ended up here and did not regret it. I'll come back again for sure.
3,It's a really nice bar with happy hours to some coctails. And they have also nice coffee and few cakes which I didn't try. You could sit outside.
2,This place offers a novel way of serving food with meat being carved directly onto your plate by the staff who are constantly passing your table. The meat was well cooked although the sides were average. Overall we found the experience to be unusual yet fun. I would recommend this to people visiting Hamburg.
3,"Ate dinner at Xeom based on the Yelp reviews. We showed up to a packed house and had about a 10 minute wait before being seated. We shared a table with two other diners in a corner of the restaurant. (Thankfully I'd read that sharing tables is common...)I ordered pho while my husband had curry chicken, and we shared spring rolls. The spring roll wrapper was a lot thicker than I am used to - I wonder if they're not available in Hamburg. The curry chicken was ok, but it had a strange smooth consistency like gravy, with big chunks of carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes. I was surprised to see tomatoes in the curry, but we ate them anyway. The pho was OK, definitely smaller portions than in the U.S., and less cuts of meat. I was given a lemon wedge whereas I'm used to receiving a lime wedge. There was also no mint leaves, beansprouts, or are jalapeño peppers... The table offered a bottle of sriracha, but no hoisin sauce. I was still hungry after dinner.Overall dinner was OK, but just not what I'm used to from the plethora of Vietnamese restaurants at home. Xeom is cash only."
4,I LOVE CURRYWURST.  Sometimes I feel like I'm an addict.  Mo-Grill gets my thumbs up!  This place is amazing if your looking for a quick-bite to eat.  I want to tell you NOW...that this is one of the best CurryWurst I have had since I been here.  I work close by here now so its convenient for me to stop by once in a while...(can't be eating too much fast food) but DANG this place is awesome.  They make their own curry sauce and the wurst is juicy and packed with flavor.  THIS PLACE IS DANK.  PERIOD
2,"Saw this on one of the maps I got after arriving in Hamburg (either one of those from the airport or one I got from my hotel) and simply thought why not? Having been to other establishments of this type (such as the London Dungeon), I felt I had a good idea of what to expect when I arrived for the short trip. With nothing in English, it was not as easy to get scared at times (not knowing what was being screamed or howled - knowing the sound and the meaning is very different)! As a result of this, I think I missed some key parts of the trip - the pictures did convey some of the meaning, but I did not feel I got the entire impression that was intended."
4,"Superb! We easily spent the whole day there. And you need to! I took over 700 photos of different scenarios we found throughout the ""lands"". Absolutely brilliant. Something for everyone. The detail and thought that has gone into this is genius. The trains are so much fun to watch, the day/night cycle offers a different perspective, the airport is amazing (with takeoff timetable and self-parking planes!!), the mini Hamburg is fantastic as well. Plus all the little ""easter egg"" finds - so much fun. You guys have thought of everything. Quite literally kept us entertained for hours. There is a cafeteria as well, with food and drinks at a reasonable price. Great for recharging half way through and you sit in coach class booths. LOVED IT! Keep it up."
4,"A small ""fast-food"" restaurant with a great flair and delicious Burritos (also very spicy if you want though)! I can only recommend to go there, but be careful : you have to pick a good moment because it is really often full and you will have to wait a little bit..."
2,"Very disappointed. If you want to go for a brunch in Pauline at weekend, reservation is definitely necessary. The reservation list has always been long and it is recommended to reserve at least 4 days ahead. I've been looking forward to try their food because it seems so popular. However, you only get a 3-star hotel kind of breakfast for their 18.7€ buffet brunch menu. Totally a ruin of appetite and absolutely too expensive for such quality of food. The only good part of it is that at least you can make a nice Instagram style picture."
4,"Great local place with an extensive menu, well prepared fresh, local ingredients, good local wine and beer at reasonable prices."
2,"My colleagues in our Hamburg office wanted Asian food delivered during our working lunch.  Being from San Francisco, again, I was hesitant with Asian food in Germany.  Also, Bok is an eclectic Asian restaurant, serving sushi, Thai food, and some hints of Chinese food.  I played it safe and went with the fried tofu with veggies.  Honestly, the fried tofu and veggies weren't bad at all.  Delicate pieces of fried tofu with fresh assorted veggies and a light gravy.  I had a bite of my colleague's fried chicken and it was enjoyable as well.  It came with a side of a sweet sauce, but I didn't use any of the sweet sauce.  If you're craving for Asian food in Hamburg, Bok isn't a bad choice."
4,It's exactly what I needed. Pancakes with a lot of syrup. It was everything I could have wished for this morning.
4,One of the best doner durums I've eaten. And 3.5 Euro is a good price.
3,"After university my friend and I used to come here for cup of coffee and snack. We really loved sitting outside on their cute small table and chairs on the vibrant and artsy street in Sternschanze.Nice and welcoming decor, attentive staff and delicious food.Definitely come here if you want to have a nice ambiance with friends."
4,"Das Piment ist ein sehr kleines nettes Restaurant in Eppendorf und wohl eines des besten Restaurants, in denen wir je gegessen haben.Es ist leider nie viel los im Piment, das mag aber auch an den Preisen liegen.Das Essen ist hervorragend genau wie der Service und wir waren nun schon einige Male hier und es gab nie auch nur die kleinste Beanstandung.Sehr nette Kreationen und fuer diejenigen, die gerne mal etwas Neues ausprobieren, ist das genau der richtige Ort. 5 Sterne fuer ein perfektes Restaurant"
4,"Absolutely worth a visit! Booking your tickets ahead  of time is highly recommended. Alternatively, you can try going on a weekday and being there very early. It worked for us - we only stood in line for about half an hour and got to see most of the exhibition before it got super crowded. There is also a cafeteria where you can get snacks, drinks or meals before starting your tour.The gift shop offers a variety of souvenirs and model trains. They also have their very own newspaper which looks super cute and realistic. Don't forget to take your free copy at the entrance!"
4,"I agree with Andrew, A meat eaters paradise. I'm surprised to read that no one has reviewed the peppercorn steak special, this steak at a low price of 13.95, come with a salad, green beans and baked potato as well. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! the steak was great, their housemade sour cream made the potato. The salad arrived shortly after our beers. Our server was so kind, always smiling and he read my mind when i was craving more sourcream."
4,"Went there with my boyfriend for our first night in Hamburg! Both of us started with a soup and then we had the seitan-Gyros plate which was delicious! The waiter was really nice too! For two soups, two gyros and a bottle of water we paid 53€, which is a bit on the pricier side but I would still highly recommend it!"
3,"I was rather impressed with the bartender at this place. He was incredibly fast while giving each drink great attention and care. The waitresses working the tiny floor are also super-attentive and friendly, which is totally unexpected for a bar (or maybe I'm just overly accustomed to the I'm-too-hipster-for-you attitude of SF bars).Drinks were really good and reasonably priced. I'm not sure I agree with the current €€€ price attribute for this place. Having gone to IMARA across the street before coming here, drinks were way better priced at The Boilerman.Space is pretty tight. I imagine it's a bit better in the summer when they can make use of their front outdoor area. If you're standing in front of the bar, you'll have a constant flow of traffic from people going to the restroom. On the other hand, watching the bartender work is kind of mesmerizing.Smoking is allowed inside, so you'll walk out smelling like you slept in a tobacco factory. You may also shave off 5 years of your life. I'm hoping that eventually changes but people do love smoking here.On a Saturday night, it was packed and pretty loud. You'll definitely need to shout to be heard by anyone other than the person right next to you. Music isn't too loud, though, so that's a plus.Drink menu we got was entirely in English, which is a bit odd since a native German asked for them. The place was heavy on English speakers though, so they may just default to English menus when that happens.If you're in the area, definitely worth checking out."
3,"Preparation takes a while but it's worth to wait. It's  a jumbo tortilla, expect nothing less, make sure you are really, really hungry before you go in :)"
4,"The first time I had the avocado sandwich. All I can say is ""Soooo delicious!"". Second time their house salad. And let's not forget their cakes!? Sooo good! Really friendly service, comfy atmosphere, delicious food. Will come back!"
4,"The world's biggest model railway. Impressive. And around it, the world, miniaturized. It is quite an amazing experience going here, which is why we do it so often :) Crazy attention is being paid to detail, much of which you don't actually even notice on your first tour through. There is a hidden Atlantis part, there are a bunch of couples having sex hidden throughout the landscapes, there are undersea caverns with sunken ships... great fun to try and investigate every corner. The light installations are also lots of fun: in one hour of real time, the Miniaturwunderland goes through several sunsets, nights, and sunrises, during which the lights fade and change color and the lighting in the scenes goes on. Quite a sight, definitely recommended. PS: Make sure you reserve/buy tickets in advance, or you might be standing in a queue for two hours, during which you will get snacks and drinks, but still. Or come really early."
2,their pasta and pizza of the day with Apple soda during lunch time is a good deal (around 6 to 7 eur).
4,"I get free coffee at work so have yet to taste it here. On a food level however, they have a great selection on salad/pasta pots, baguettes, bagels etc, as well as brownies, flapjacks and such. Good service and friendly staff."
3,"Visit this Starbucks just to look up and out.  Beautiful location, ceiling and views.  That explains my four stars.  The service, prices and most everything else related to this, and most foreign Starbucks, are overrated.  Unless of course you are missing a taste and feeling from home (if you are US American).  Recommendation for Tourists: Go in, look, if you are willing buy a drink and go sit on the Binnenalster to enjoy people and boat watching.  If it is too cold, might as well stay inside and enjoy the ceiling.  If you have a taste for coffee, find a local place far away from Jungfernsteig. Far, far away."
4,"Over the years I have managed to go to the bird every time i am in hamburg. i have been to hamburg many times. and the bird is a highlight. The fries are fresh potatoes and the burgers re ridiculously good. they are fat, mine are bloody red, juicy, and messy. served on an english muffin which is a nice touch. full bar, awesome staff, and punk rock at heart. i have had the steak once- ribeye- and it was great, but the burgers really are the main attraction. lots of choices in preparation, i go basic cheese with an egg (the dumb texan) but the big rock is great, and my vegetarian pals  say the black bean option is killer. the bird is worth your time."
4,"Hole-in-the-wall, great value!I walked up to the counter and showed the guy a photo from Yelp -- he was cool with it lol Halbes Hähnchen (1/2 roasted chicken)Pommes (fries)Curry ketchup -- it's like a sweet gravy. I wanted to get brown gravy on my fries but I don't think he would have done it hahaSuper affordable. Delicious and very filling!"
3,"I was there with a group of friends from Japón and my boyfriend. Their love the sashimi, the quality is the fish was good and of course fresh. I was exciting because of the yakitory, but it was the worst dish from the table.I'll try to go again to give them another change."
4,"Visit this place for authentic Cantonese Dim Sum, probably the best in town. This manifests itself with 90% of the dining guests being Chinese.The portions have European dimensions, the prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."
2,Everything was decent here- quite good non-dolsot bi bim bap (ie the less expensive option not served in a hot stone bowl) with ample namul sides. Problem is really the pricing- 15 euros for the dolsot option is more like $21 Canadian and that's just not worth it. If I lived in Hamburg and were desperate for Korean I'd make a beeline but I can't see coming back when there are better and cheaper options back home. Service was fast and very friendly.
3,"I don't know how I missed this place during the first 6 weeks I lived in Hamburg only a short walk away!Came here for lunch with coworkers. I ordered the Gyrosteller mit Mextaca sahnesoße, tzatski und pommes. Very good, large portions, great lunch spot. The lunch menu comes with a small salad, main dish and a small desert. In this case, dessert was a cinnamon rice pudding with brown sugar.Very reasonably priced at only €6,90 per person.The staff was friendly and helpful. Our meal came out quick and they checked on us during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed and to ensure that it met our expectations."
4,"Went here for breakfast and literally cannot fault the place. Sat outside on the cushioned windowsill in lovely nostalgic autumnal sunlight and drank coffees and heard fog horns from the river. We then sat inside for our food - sharing the one table in the place with a couple of other people. Beautiful platter of meat and cheese and perfectly cooked boiled eggs. Wonderful milchkaffee and the friendliest people run the place. Very relaxed, brilliant. Deserves some points for x-factor."
4,I found this Brazilian restaurant by accident and I found it awesome. Very friendly staff and the food super yummy. It's really worth the place :)
2,"Crikey! All you can eat chicken wings! But only on Tuesdays and Sundays. Going with a larger group helps. Then you can try everything! Every order, of your all-you-can-eat wings, comes with about 6 or so wings on a plate. And they have 18 different flavors to choose from.I ate a ton here. Too much, I would say. So much so that I definitely did not want to see cooked chicken again on a plate for like at least a day or something. :o)My favorite styles were ""Germany"" (honey mustard) and ""Denmark"" (a special remoulade). All of the other wings we tried were pretty decent. The ""Thailand"" style was actually much spicier than the ""Australian"" one which was purported to be ""Hot like hell."" It's a pretty fun spot overall, especially for groups, and it's actually located below street level...or...down under!"
3,"We were hungry after a day of racing, but wanted some Hamburg panfish. We sat outside, and had a great meal. Not a bargain, but, with the great environment, and helpful staff, we were very happy. The roast beef was served cold, which is nice on a summer day, and the Swiss soup is nice with a celery base. Yum."
4,This was such an eye opening experience. I would recommend everyone to give this museum a chance and let it show you a different world.
4,"Leckere Pastagerichte mit Salatbeilage auf Wunsch. Bei Rita schmeckts wirklich prima, ideal fuer den Business Lunch. Im Sommer kann man nett draussen sitzen. Einzig die  guenstige  Preisgestaltung bleibt undurchsichtig: mal kostet Salat extra, mal nicht."
3,"For work reasons I wanted to try new Catering restaurants. Not only those the food tastes good, they are efficient, fast and know what their clients want! They come on time and are extremely friendly. Totally recommend them!"
4,"This doesn't look like much but boy is the food good. True authentic north Indian cuisine. Even had a kingfisher with my meal. You get a large portion of food for a very good price; the thalis which includes rice, yoghurt, some lentil sauce and your curry of choice cost between 6 and 8 euros which is really good.They also have lots of deserts on sales each costing 0.8. We each got a couple different ones and tried them. Unfortunately I don't remember most names but I wasn't a fan of the milk cake. Worth noting the staff speak both English and German."
3,Moraba means marmalade in Farsi and is owned by a very friendly persian Guy. Its a nice bar in the Schanze which is mostly frequented by women at the weekend who warm up for nightlife and a good place to have breakfast in the week also the best place to have a fruit juice.
4,"Those pancakes doe, for everyone who has been to Pancake-countries such as Canada or the US and then is craving for real thick yummy pancakes, needs to go to Mamalicious! This is the No. 1 spot for pancakes in Hamburg. I will never forget that day when I went to Mamalicious for the first time and a lady passed by and took pics of our food because it looked so incredibly gooood!"
4,"Luigis is, BY FAR, the best Italian food I've had anywhere in Germany.  The pizza is wood fired and huge...fresh ingredients and superb.  The pasta bolognese was outstanding as well...noodles were perfectly al dente.  I don't ever give five stars...this would have been six stars."
3,"Cool student bar in the Grindel that actually has more going on than meets the eye. Inside theyve got a foosball table and a back room where theyve got jazz on Wednesday nights, show Tatort on Sunday nights, and host other smaller concerts as well. The furniture is a nice living room style hodge podge set up, the people that hang out are friendly and so are the folks that work here. Drinks are well priced and theyve got a good selection of tea as well. Soft pretzels are a nice touch when you want something salty to go along with your beer. Some nights they have a DJ as well spinning some of his favorite vinyl. By day a great place to read or play chess and by night a great place to have a drink with friends and chat up the others hanging out."
3,"We'd ridden the trains all day, toured Hamburg, and were hungry! The Nagel bierstube has great beer (Nagelbrau is a nice dark beer) and good traditional fare. The schnitzel is satisfying and the prices are reasonable. You could do a lot worse and walk a lot further. I was very happy, and so was my partner. Also, they have a full bar!"
4,"Utterly charming, and obviously -- people know! My husband and I were taking a stroll around beautiful Hamburg on our last day, and happened to find ourselves faced with a 2 hour wait at the Miniature Museum (next time). A quick pop of the Yelp app and we found ourselves at Ti Breizh devouring gorgeous crepes within a few minutes. Now, this was midday on a Sunday -- it obviously gets very busy and is very popular, so typically reservations are recommended. This Breton-inspired, white wash wood interiored gem was just what we needed after a long night and heavy morning of walking. I chose the Nordic savoury crepe with loads for smoked salmon and fresh dill. Mmmmm, so nice. Served with a nice side salad. Though we weren't toting our toddler, it did some very kid friendly (at this hour anyway) with several children at most of the tables near us. Kid chairs available and by nature, crepes are very child approved! There's a small shop in the front selling clothing that fits the theme (ALL stripes), unfortunately they closed before I could finish eating so I didn't get a chance to peek around. I likely would've bought something, too. 5-stars easily -- sometimes there is a reason a place is so popular, and the reason at Ti Breizh is because it is fantastic. Next time -- dessert crepes with nutella and wine for days. Delightful."
4,"If you want to drink a glass of wine with a wonderful panoramic view, don't hesitate to go up to this bar restaurant. You will have access to the rooftop where you can chill on the comfortable benches or armchairs. The waiters are kind and they know their products so they can advise you for your order. The only thing is that it's a bit expensive but you will forget the price once you taste their tasty wines."
4,"CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!Yes, this is a chocolate lover's dream. It's a chocolate museum and factory with a large specialty chocolate shop attached. Hachez chocolate is the magic brand that runs this museum and boy, is it amazing.They have few tours in English (as well as other languages, depending on the season) so make sure you get one in your preferred language as it's a word-heavy tour and you won't understand much if you don't have a full grasp of German. If you have a larger group, you can always contact them for private tours.I've been three times and every time the tour guides were lovely and super excited (who wouldn't be, working with chocolate all day) and very knowledgable. They walk you trough the history of cocoa and chocolate first, you may even get to try a raw, unprocessed cocoa bean straight from the pod! They taste surprisingly citrussy, actually. Not like cocoa at all, or at least the processed cocoa we're accustomed to.Then you're led into their labratory! Which is a large kitchen area where you get to decorate your own bar of chocolate. Upon buying your tour ticket, you can also pay for an extra bar (one bar is included with every entry ticket) and it's well worth it. I get the extra bar every time and make one for a friend or family member.They use high quality milk chocolate and there's a huge selection of toppings for you to use, from sprinkles over gummy bears to praline crumble, coconut flakes and chocolate chips, nuts and more. You get to fully customize how much and what you want to put on your chocolate bar(s).After your visit to the laboratory, it's off to the second part of the tour. Here you find out how the process of making raw cocoa beans into actual chocolate works. You're introduced to all methods and machinery and get to sample a lot of the products on the way. And by sample I absolutely mean pig out as they're really generous with their samples if you're nice about it!After the tour concludes you get to wrap your hand decorated bar of chocolate yourself and take it home with you. If it makes it home before ending up in your stomach, that is.The tour might seem a bit on the expensive side, but it's worth every single penny and more. I come back here way too often..."
4,"Really nice small café in a kind of backyard atmosphere.The staff is very friendly and seems to know something about coffee. I chose a mug of the fresh brewed filter coffee and got it served lukewarm, so the the smell had time to unfold itself. It really tasted great! The cheesecake is awesome! A dream!!!!!The interior looks nice. Simple, chic and modern. You can also buy coffee beans and brewing tools here.Definitely to recommend!"
2,"We liked this place although I can understand how some people may have things to complain about. I found the interior as well as outdoor seating very inviting and service was competent yet somewhat slow. The woman, whom I believe owns this place, tends to stay inside. She seems to be the most service oriented but usually doesn't do waitressing to tables. Anyway, we come here for the cakes and quite enjoy them. The selection may be somewhat limited but they always seems to have something we enjoy. I especially like their assortment of coffees and usually get a ""Grosser Brauner"" which is my favorite. Food here is kind of hit or miss outside of breakfast. You can pretty much depend on their breakfast offering. I'd recommend simply checking it out for yourself. Do remember that if you are sitting outside and it's sunny or a lot of people are out and about in the Hafencity, it tends to get kind of loud."
4,"One of my favourite restaurants of the area. They got a lot of nice Portuguese and Spanish food on offer as well as the usual San Miguel and Sagres beer. Loads of yummy seafood things (meat, too, for all you carnivores) and great tapas. All very delicious. Aioli and bread will get served before the main meal so you can feast on that first. And it's worth it. Even though your partner / colleagues will hate you later on / the next day.The waiters are really pleasant - and always happy to deliver a wisecrack on top of it all.Prices are moderate especially compared to the other Portuguese restaurants in the middle of the street.It's strongly recommended."
4,"A range of great burgers and beers, and the service is very good; you'll be served quickly and, in my experience, food doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to arrive. Plus, if there's a Bundesliga or 2.Bundesliga game, they'll have it on all of their three TVs. Really cool place."
1,"Cute little cafe unfortunately the service is slow and not quite attentive. The coffee is good but the food could be better, the eggs had not been properly boiled, cheese came with a bit of plastic still attached to it and the bread they serve for a large breakfast plate for two persons is only two tiny slices and two really small knäckebröd wedges. We basically had to ask for extra bread so we could finish the plate and we were asked exactly how many slices we'd require. I should also mention where we sat (at the back of the place) a few spiderwebs were hanging from the ceiling and that's simply not nice."
3,"Love this place especially during spring, drinks are yummy n strong, wide variety.music sometimes is too loud to talk n the toilets a bit smelly."
4,"Excellent food, service, and ambiance. The price went up to 6.50 EUR, but the generous portions and quality of food is still the same. I hope the restaurant realizes that students and tourists on a tight budget rely on this place to continue offering great service and delicious meals for a reasonable price."
2,"On a 5 minute walk from the central station I found this Thai/Japanese restaurant. Small, but cosy. Restaurant entourage was sparse, not that many oriental stuff on the walls like you see in so many other Asian restaurants. Light is semi bright, you can actually see what your eating... (and who your talking to)The Japanese Asai beer on the menu was not available, had to revert to Kirin (also ok!).Tried Sashimi moriawase (mixed raw fish) for starters and a hot Thai beef curry as main course.It took a considerable amount of time to serve the starting course. The Sashimi was almost worth the wait, very tasty fish indeed. The surimi sticks could have been replaced by some other fresh fish (not so very original..).Only the wasabi was not as spicy and hot as I hoped for.The main course, curry beef, was exactly what I hoped for. Very hot and tasty! Albeit that the beef was a little overcooked and hence not that tender as it could have been. All in all a okay experience, but not so excellent as other reviewers indicated."
4,"Unbelievable, this place has a name! Thanks Kittles! The Sofabar was one of the first bars I visited when I came to Germany, and remains one of my favorite evening locales (during that dead hour after the evening is over but night hasn't begun yet). While the place is mostly packed, the Sofabar is always cozy, comfortable and inviting. Furnished with 20-odd sofas, the Sofabar is great for couples, but especiallyfor groups of 5 or more - this makes the Sofabar a great spot for birthdays! The Sofabar is one of Hamburg's most unique locales and a must-visit for those wanting to try out something different than the traditional bartop."
4,"Neapolitan Pizza, how it is supposed to taste. :)The interior is more spacious than it seems from the outside; comfortable, but no setting for a cozy night out or so (Ottensen's 'Farina meets Mehl' is more pricey, but better in that respect).But the value for lunch is excellent here at €7 for a Margherita and a water, a little more for buffalo mozzarella. Not aware that any of the other Neapolitan places even comes close (well, Schanze's Pizza Jill is good at lunch, too).Will be back and will bring the kids."
3,"Great panino and pasta, friendly staff, coffee not the best"
4,This place is Amazing!! The servers are very attentive and very nice and the food is great! All the food is very fresh and it doesn't break your wallet and the portions are huge.
3,Fast and delicious!  Tried the wagyu cheeseburger loved how light it was . I would qlso recommended their mochi !
3,"I got some takeaway grilled meats here with my Cypriot flat mate on a lazy Saturday evening. What can I say: it was delicious! The service was friendly, and the portions plenty. The meat was perfectly grilled (not dry at all), and the tzatiki fresh. Only downside: the chips were not great (but then again--my Belgian nationality requires me to be this picky when it comes to those golden sticks of deliciousness). I had to take my Greek-speaking companion's word on the authenticity, but it definitely tasted that way. Great place for a cheap pig-out meal, but if you want more refined Greek food, there are other places."
4,"Walked all around Hamburg in moderately cold weather and by the time the end of the day rolled around, we were hangry, tired, and ready for some good comfort food. Wanting to really grasp the authenticity of our trip to Germany, we decided on German food. This restaurant is fairly close to Wunderland so if you're heading over there, definitely recommend stopping by! Typically you have to make a reservation but we were lucky and arrived at around 5:30 pm and scored a nice little table for 2 by the window. They were super sweet in giving us a simplified english menu, along with the normal german one. I desperately tried to understand the regular menu but it was tough for someone who literally only knows ""danke"" and can barely pronounce it correctly!I was really craving Schnitzel and Spaetzle but unfortunately they did not have any spaetzle so I went for Schnitzel or the breaded pork with a fried egg and fried potatoes. My friend got the Salmon with Taligatelle. I also ordered a lübzer pils (0.5L obviously) and my friend took a bottle of still water.the food was super quick to arrive and it was delicious! my pork was moist, juicy with the most perfectly cooked and fresh egg (very yummy compared to the ones you get in the US!) and the potatoes were unbelievably tasty! My friend's pasta was also very well seasoned and her salmon was buttery and fresh. The meal really blew us away and hit the spot. Service was a little slow since it packed up quickly and we were all the way in the corner but that's fine--I enjoy the leisure of getting to relax and enjoy dinner at our own pace! Don't forget, if you pay with a card, you should definitely tip some cash extra. 10% is customary for sit down restaurants and Das Kontor definitely deserved it! Danke!!"
4,This is THE place to go get a burger! I have to say that although I mostly prefer white meat and many times vegan meals - I love to go get myself a juicy one there! Its that amazing! The meat is good quality steak meat and the buns are from this great bread made with egg Apart from all.. There are real potato fresh made fries that I usually just get to taste after im super full with the burger. Loving them though my fav is Da Birdhouse with double patties. Thats one cheerful place besides the great food!
4,"Leaning house of awesomeness! This is one of those hidden-away pearls of Hamburg. Sadly, now that Hafen City has been planted, this may become a bit less hidden in the near future. The food, in a word, is KILLER. Try the Hamburg Hamburger... sample the potato salad, or venture into the unknown with the Hamburg Weißwürstchen, either way you will not be leaving hungry or poor. The service is friendly, but very Hamburg... so if you are an ass, they will treat you accordingly. The location is small and very much heeled over like a ship at sea, frozen at a 15º -- while some people find this to be charming... others, as I recently learned, simply can not eat in such an environment. The music is pure Bert Kaempfert classics from 1950 - 1970. If you don't know who Bert Kaempfert is, shame on you! Now go Google him. In summary, if you are in this area and are looking for a place to eat. This is the place. If you want to grab a bite before heading off to the Elbphilharmonie... well, you have time... but this is a good place to spend it."
3,"Ich habe gestern wie immer gutes Sushi bekommen, mussten auch nur kurz warten aber das ist ja kein Problem im jeden anderen Restaurant muss ich auch auf mein Essen warten.  Das nebeneinander sitzen finde ich bei gewissen Nachbarn sogar ganz geil, ich meine die Leute müssen ja auch nicht ihre intimen Pärechengespräche in einem Restaurant führen.  Nur 4 Sterne weil es gestern echt lange gedauert hat bis mal eine andere Sorte Sushi auf dem Band war."
4,Looked for a place to eat near the Crowne Plaza and saw the Sangers was close. Went for a short five minute walk for a wonderful meal that was made and prepared with quality and care. Six of us were in the group and not only was the good worth the price the flavor was amazing.
4,"Miniature Wunderland is the world's largest model railway layout, and makes for a super half day out for children (of all ages).Actually, it might be more accurate to say layouts: the exhibition area is an amazing 5,000m2, and there are rooms depicting Austria, Switzerland, different parts of Germany, Scandinavia and even parts of the USA (not the UK, though, alas!). And it isn't just abut trains: one of the most popular exhibits is a huge scale model of Hamburg airport, complete with planes taxiing and taking off, with all the service vehicles scurrying about, and even cars queuing for the car parks!It's hard to describe everything as there is so much to see  and it is as much about the details as it is the scale. As well as trains, planes and cars, there are trams, ski lifts, cable-cars, and even model ships moving through the fjord in the Norwegian section  where the water tank even has a tide. Some areas are on two levels, and the depiction of iron-ore mining town of Kiruna in Sweden shows the underground mine workings: kids seemed to love pressing the button that sets off an explosion. (There are buttons to press at various points to make things happen). There are football stadia and pop concerts taking place, as well as fairs and religious processions, all peopeld with thousands of 1cm high people. Oh, and the whole place regularly switches from day to night, when the twinkling of millions (literally) of LED lights gives a completely different perspective.My favourite cameo was a man chopping down a tree which then crashes through the roof of the adjacent house. The lady of the house then comes out and remonstrates with him! The control centre is also fascinating to watch (lots of screens controlling everything) in a James Bond-ish kind of way.Facilities include a cafe and large shop (of course). There are lifts between the floors, although a few sections can only be reached via stairs. You can reserve a timed entry ticket online  expect it to be very busy at weekends and in school holidays, so avoid these times if you can.There are leaflets available in English, although the buttons are in German only."
3,"They just finished renovating and have a whole second floor for eating now! It's a great place to grab a quick meal before a movie at the Savoy. Fast and quick, but still pretty tasty. I don't want to know why it's so cheap, but I'll take it."
3,"Once in a while, one simply wants a good steak. After being a vegetarian for a year (and previously spending my time with either fellow vegetarians or kosher-keepers), I had very little experience with Hamburg's selection of meat. After much deliberation, our party of three decided to forego the ide of an upscale steak joint for Hopi - a much recommended, affordable steakhouse in Hoheluft-Ost/Harvestehude. Service was a bit slow to start with, but our meals arrived quickly. I had a ""Hopi Steak"", which was 8.90 for a 200g argentinian beef steak, a baked potato and a piece of garlic bread. The meat was okay - a solid slab of beef, but nothing exceptional. I found it very ""gummy"", hard to cut and chew. I'm not a meat connoisseur, so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about. I finished the meal off with a very yummy tartufo. Overall, I had a good, solid experience at Hopi and I'll be glad to come back. The worth for money is quite good, I'd recommend this for anyone who'd like a laid-back steak dinner in the neighborhood at an affordable price. For me, my quest for a really great steak continues."
2,"Went there for a business dinner. Recommended by a colleague.The beer is good, but given the fact that they are a brewery, choices you have a a bit sparse.The craft been (only one available) is lacking a proper description.Food is OK. Waiters however were good - friendly, quick. Location is very nice.Noise Level to high for business lunch - unless of course you are looking for Nomunication."
1,"I really wanted to love this place simply because it's vegan and even brought (4!) non-veg friends to try it out but it was disappointing. They were out of almost everything so we went with mediocre veggie patties on dry buns and ok sauce with no table service and overpriced (tiny!) bottles of fritz colas. There are definitely better vegan/veggie burgers to be had in Hamburg, even just a couple blocks away."
3,"My roommate loves pasta and she wanted to come along to my last nice dinner with my boyfriend who was visiting for the weekend, so of course I took her recommendation but na klar did not take her along. Ordered the creamy salmon pasta - nice saltiness, perfectly fatty sauce with generous chunks of cooked salmon wrapped inside the noodles. Partner got the simple tomato sauce pasta - it was a bit on the plain side and a bit too salty, particularly with extra Parmesan. The Parmesan in itself was a highlight though - this cute, bright grater that looked like a children's toy was filled to the brim with real Parmesan AND left at our table so we could indulge ad hoc in Parma heaven. We also had some house wine, which was very generous for the price, and the setting was also very cute - I had some doubts about the location, right next to Landungsbrücke, but Pastalozzi is off on a side street and we were the only ones sitting at a dimly lit, dark oak table in the back. Also candles! What romance! Parmagnificent."
0,"Just had a dinner as a family of three at Khan. In short: I can not recommend.The meat quality is really low, hygiene is problematic,if you have a baby the only edible stuff is some chicken and sweet stuff.If you leave any food on your plate they will come and warn you and penalize you €5s per person that you did not eat all on your plate.Sorry, no one needs such a dinner."
4,"Food was delicious!! Specifically the prawn coriander dimsum. I even forgot to take the picture. . We also ordered another chicken dimsum (this was a bit ordinary), cashew chicken and fried fish. All of them were super tasty. Probably best chinese food i have ever eaten in Germany."
4,"This bar seems little on the outside, but turns out to be pretty big on the inside. Besides the two regular rooms with cute tables and picknick chairs, theres another room in the back, just as big, great in case it gets crowded. The sunday breakfast buffet is probably the best Ive seen since living in Hamburg. Everything you can think of having for breakfast, big chance they offer it in here! And, last but not least, its affordable! I definitely will come back here, as my friends also recommend this place during the week, on every day evenings. Great to grab a bite, coffee, breakfast or relaxing afternoon!"
4,"Can't tell if the people here are French German or German French! The whole restaurant feel very authentic with a fun sailor vibe. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it seems-aside from the tables in the back there is an upstairs and a patio that they open when there's nice weather. The menu is really extensive and it was hard to decide what to order!We ordered table cider, the savory crepe with the poached pear and the chefs special, which was a crepe with a specialty sausage, mushrooms and salad.The table cider came in a cute mug and was delicious. The pear!!! Was!!! Spectacular!!!! The savory sweet flavors really hit the spot. This was a second dinner of sorts so if we hadn't been so full, we would have ordered a sweet crepe. I just admired from afar!!"
4,"Really good quality meat. Hefty portions for very reasonable prices, especially take away. Really friendly staff who know their stuff & always put a smile on your face when you go in (think it's family owned)."
4,"Bleeuggh. I was clearly here, since my phone checked me in and I have photos to prove it. However having followed the crowds down at 5.30 am following all night Chelsea-beating-Bayern revelry I don't remember much about it!What I DO remember though was Queen Mary 2 gliding by at 6am plus being saved by about a pint of hot cappuccino poured into me an hour later. So many people there for the Fischmarket  thousands were there even at sunrise on Sunday!"
3,Very nice Thai restaurant in the Hafencity! Interior is nice and cosy.The menu is great and not too many dishes on there so one can keep a good overview :-)Worth a try
1,"I went to Casa di Roma a while ago, invited by a friend upon recommendation by the Hotel Atlantic's concierge. While the food was decent, but hardly anything to write home about, the attitude of one manager in particular was rather disgusting. It seemed as if he didn't have a particularly nice day and felt like sharing the feeling with both his employees and guests, which I found utterly unacceptable. The friendly waitress tending our table could only try to limit the damage. Needless to say, I shall never return to Casa di Roma. Since then (listen up, conspiracy theorists worldwide!) I've learned that Casa di Roma is rather frequently recommended by hotel concierges in Hamburg. Personally, I have to wonder why. (Second star awarded personally to the waitress.)"
4,"I love this place! This is one of those good friends that just never let you down. The creativity is always inspiring mixing tastes that are truly delightful with beautiful presentation that makes me pause a moment and just take it in. The atmosphere is sophistocated while keeping it very down to Earth. I think anyone would feel comfortable here. I really can't call this place expensive - considering the quality and when you go hereyou know you're getting something good! Check the menu on their website, that way you won't be surprised. :-)"
3,"So much more than meets the eye when entering gute stube. Go for the garden in the back of the weather allows for it. You get a lot of food for your money, we had the chicken salad. All good ingredients, however the salad was lacking a rinse. The rest was great. Delicious homemade bread was served as a gesture, and we had a delicious home made lemonade with strawberries and mint. Definitely worth a visit, and great service all the way through."
3,"Really cool to see but it can be quite packed because of how touristy it is. It was very fasinating how detailed everything was and I can see how people can spend a few hours or even half of a day in here. If you're in Hamburg, it's worth a peek at."
4,"This is place is really good, delicious food, good ambiance, good prices. You have to try the crepe flambé, I want to go back soon."
3,I came in on first opening day. Staff is very friendly and food was very good. This restaurant is now on my regular weekly lunch break list. I give one star less because kitchen is rather slow but I give this to quite busy conditions in first days when we were waiting 10-15 minutes just for seats. Will see how things will look after few months. Hope the spirit will stay and food quality will not drop.
4,Very cool place. Entrance is 10 euros (less for children). It was very interesting seeing all the cars (and the progression of the car through history). I would definitely recommend doing this. The staff was also very helpful and were able to speak English.There is also a small café and gift shop.
4,"This is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant! As we walked in we were already so glad to be there. The interior design is so pleasing - both calm and hip. It would be a great place to bring a big group to. Clean lines mostly white, accented with dark wood tables and yellow cushioned benches gave it an snappy touch. There are only about 10 main dishes on the menu which is in my opinion a good sign. Everything tastes fresh. My friend and I ordered two different things and shared. The veggies were crisp and the meat perfectly prepared - the beef was tender and the chicken and pork were crisply grilled. I thought the offer was cleverly assembled, offering a variety in just one dish. For example: the grilled combination of pork, shrimp and egg roll on vermiccelli. It is located about 10 min. walking distance from Central Station or directly at U-Lohmuehlenstrasse. The price per plate is around 6-8 Euros. I suggest trying the Vietnamese beer, Saigon, made from rice. It was really good - kind of like Sake. They offer cocktails as well and of course tea."
0,"Watch out, they close at random times. After a long slog through the cold and rain, we walked through their front door and were told they're closing at 9:30, even though they normally close at 11. No explanation was given. It was only 9:20 when we got there, but they refused to seat us anyways. I was really looking forward to eating here, so their complete lack of consideration really pissed me off. In spite of their good reviews, they're not worth it."
4,"**UPDATE 13/7* Music was absolutely fantastic in here last night! They really have an awesome DJ who doesn't want to bring it down till 7am, so we just couldn't go home! Plus 1 star from me, and highly recommended free venue for the 4-7 slot before you're off to the fish market! ********I really like this place, even more now I know they serve really cheap cocktails until midnight! It looks great empty, but you'll mostly see a heaving sweaty crowd of revellers. I'm not sure there are any fire regulations in Germany as I regularly see clubs/bars with more people than would be legally allowed in the UK, but, it's all good fun. Till there's a fire."
4,"This is a must go to place!! Just make sure you go there very hungry. 5 star service, great people that truly enjoy their job. I find this rare in Germany. The food is just amazing. I havent tried too many dishes but the ones I have are, like I said, amazing!I recommend you get the 52 mit Pommes. It is a lot of food. My wife had the calamari which I tried and they were just perfect.Check this place out!!!"
4,"Amazing turkish place in the Hamburg city center...!!! Service is super fast, I really like this!! You can enjoy a huge choice of turkish food: donner, cous cous, felafel, rice, etc.Everything is so good and really cheep! Perfect if you want to enjoy a quick lunch with co-workers.Perfect for eating inside or for take-away. Please not that it could become crowded around 12."
4,"Gorgeous restaurant with a delightful staff. I had weinerschnitzel, which was two giant pieces fried perfectly along with the best german-fried potatoes I've eaten. I didn't care for the cucumber salad, but my wife's fish pot of three meats, sauce and veggies was delicious. We each got a soup, one crab one potato and they were fantastic.  Really enjoyed the meal here and would go back if we were staying longer!"
4,"People had been telling me that this place does the best Turkish food in Hamburg for years  basically ever since I lived in Hamburg. Last Friday I finally remembered to check it out, and boy was I glad that I did! Two of us arrived at about 8pm on a Friday. There were already about 10 people waiting for tables, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The service was pleasant and quick, but it's worth noting that they do not serve any alcohol here. What they do serve is meat! Basically everything on the menu and everything that I saw being delivered to tables looked amazing. The kebab plate that I ordered (I forget the name, sadly) was huge and very tasty, but my companion's lamb kebab was even better. I will be back to try more of the menu, and I'll be bringing more friends!"
1,"Borchers is a local bar and restaurant in Eppendorf, with a large dining room and an even bigger outdoor patio and sidewalk seating area. It's the kind of place that I can imagine has been here for years, and like a certain bar in Boston, everyone might just know your name.The atmosphere is nice, the service is friendly, and the food is edible, but none of it seems to come together into a cohesive dining experience for me.On one visit I had the Seelachs (pollack?) with potato salad, and on another visit I had the Wiener Schnitzel with white asparagus, potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. The fish was decent, but the Wiener Schnitzel was unremarkable, and the asparagus was overcooked.I suspect Borchers is a great place to sit outside and drink beer on a warm day, but the food is just not that good."
2,"Service is average and the beer is kind of a dissapointment.  Neat location on a canal. Hard to explain the beer;  I had their copper lager which is almost a dunkel but doesn't get to the richness of a dunker, and lacks something if it's trying to be closer to an altbier. The summer lager I had was full of all kinds of spices like coriander, but it was just kind of cloying in flavor.Had the flatbread pizzas, which were great; vegetarian options are here, and you can make some stuff vegan."
4,"Best Restaurant in Hamburg. Food is amazing and the staff is great. The Mezze offers different starters every time, and the rack of lamb is delicious time and time again."
4,"We went last night to Bok as I was in the mood for some asian food. I hadn't been here in years and took a look at the ratings. Was a bit worried as the Bok restaurants have been getting ""destroyed"" in the ratings because of service. WELL, they're listening. I was shocked at how nice our waiter was. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy. He asked every time he walked by whether everything was OK and whether we needed anything else. Almost American style (which pisses me off in the US but is nice to see in Germany). The food is great as everyone else writes. The menu is extensive and you'll find everything to fullfill you Asian eating wishes. The places tend to be full on Friday and Saturdays so consider reserving a table. I also can't wait until HH restaurants become all non-smoking. The place was not well ventilated and the people smoking around us kinda killed the experience and flavors of the food. This is soon remedied. In short, the service (at least at this outpost of Bok) took the bad criticism and made an effort to make us happy. Hopefully we didn't just get a good waiter and the rest suck. It will really be disappointing if I go back and service pisses me off. Then I'll never return as everyone else will simply have been right. UPDATE: We were there last night and service was horrible. We received half of our order wrong and the waitress serving us was less than interested in being good at her job. Further, both tables next to us also had mixed up orders. Finally, to top it all off, the folks behind us ordered something which was grilled at their table. Without my knowing it, my back was covered with oil which was splattering all over the place. My shirt was pretty much ruined and luckily I had my leather coat on a chair on the other side of the table. The management didn't care much about offering a solution for this problem except in hindsight saying I should switch seats....note this is after the back of my shirt was splattered with cooking oil. Finally, the food was less than stellar. The sushi was cut super thing (which was not the case the last time we were there). Additonally, I ordered a grilled beef dish which really didn't taste like much. Oh well, I wanted to like Bok but I won't be returning."
4,"Carnivore heaven! There's not much to say: If you like meats, go here.Note: it's cash only, get here early for lunch or prepare to wait in line, and don't expect to be productive for at least an hour after having the big plate.Only minus I can think of is that there's limited seating when outdoor is not an option.Oh, and regular visits here probably guarantee a heart attack (it isn't exactly healthy)."
4,Excellent tour with lots of sampling along the way. Our guide Christine was hilarious and made sure to get people involved. English tours are given twice a day and all the employees I talked to had very good English. My friends and I loved our chocolate bars that we got to make.
3,"My friend and I had a lovely lunch here today after spending about two hours enjoying the Miniatur Wunderland not far away.Good service (what? yes!) from an attentive waitress who helped with our orders, brought us beer and food and was amazingly swift with the check. She was even able to split it across two credit cards. Yes!I've been craving currywurst for some reason and so that's what I had for lunch. A nice sized sausage with a spicy sauce and a big serving of fries. It perfectly satisfied my craving. And the delicious lager with it? Ja!Free wifi worked well as we tried to work out what we'd do next in this city.[Review 12056 overall, 1839 of 2019.]"
4,"Honestly one of the best tourist attractions in the world. You absolutely must see this place at some point in your life. Miniatur Wunderland is a massive museum of models. It started out as just model railways, and indeed railways do continue to make up a significant portion of the place, but it's expanded to so much more. There are glorious mountainous scenes, recreations of the world's great cities, and piles and piles of cars and humans as well. My personal favourite is the model airport, with a huge selection of planes, terminals, fuel trucks, passengers. Literally everything has been thought of. The planes even land and take off in front of your eyes! Tremendous!The detail throughout the place is astounding. I literally spent 10 minutes just staring at the football stadium, where a match between Hamburg and St. Pauli was happening. The spectator's excitement, the floodlights. Top class. Another little detail that caught my eye was when I peered into a random office building, and saw two colleagues secretly kissing in the office. A tiny detail that most people probably don't see, but it is so realistic and well thought-out. I'm sure these details are evident throughout the Wunderland. Would love to hear about some others from people. :)It's well worth the entrance cost. You can really see where your money is going when you pass by the workshop and see the newer areas being constructed. I can't even imagine the sheer number of hours that went into creating this, and there's more being built all the time. By paying your entry fee, you are helping create something amazing!There is a shop and restaurant on site, both of which are reasonably priced, and have a selection of stuff. The shop has a huge variety of models and toys and collectibles. The restaurant interior is designed to look like sitting on a train or in an aeroplane. Very cool.In conclusion, if you're anywhere close to Hamburg, please PLEASE visit Miniatur Wunderland. I don't regret it one bit, and hope to be back to see your new creations in the future. :D"
4,"What an amazing experience, it was made more interesting due to the language barrier for me. Friendly staff and the menu kept me guessing. Once the friendly guide knew I was Australian he made an extra effort to translate most things for me which I really appreciated. I booked online from Australia and the customer service was top notch. All my questions and queries were answered promptly. I went by myself and wouldn't recommend it unless you can speak German as unless you are lucky like I was tonight you will struggle knowing what's happening."
4,"For the buffet: Fried chicken is super, also the black pepper beef is really tasty. Sushi is OK-ish. Always so crouded at noon, because it sits inside a company campus. Service is really fast. The restaurant is bright and big, but a little bit loud."
3,"Simple cuisine, friendliest waitress and great terrace to have some fresh mint tea in a sunny day!"
1,"Should have listened to the reviews. We waited an hour (we were told upfront though that we'd have to wait a bit as they were too busy until 4pm) but it was quite a let-down especially for the price. Two meager lamb ""bon-bons"" on sautéed spinach and boiled potatoes. Dry bird on the same spinach-potato bed in some canned tasting tomato-sauce. The only good thing was the homemade tea lemonade. Ambience is ok but overpriced and meh. Lackluster service. Spend your dollars elsewhere."
3,"This Indian restaurant defines exactly what needs to be important to stay in business in competitive Food industry. This is very well placed restaurant, just 5 mins walk away from Railway Station. It doesn't have any super decorative stuff or some light show on the outside, but still it's not very difficult to find. I shouldn't actually call it a restaurant, but it's more of self service Diner. No fancy decorations or extra comfortable seats to make you sit there for really long time, some light music, everything is surprising. But the best part is food. No Hocus Pokus or 20 pages Menu which makes consumer's life very easy. Food is really very good with prices worth to make student's life easy. I really liked the Lamb Curry there. It's highly recommended. The restaurant also has many varieties of Indian sweets for take away. The food is served in traditional Indian Plates called Thali which was a nostalgic experience - reminded me of Langar (practice common to few Indian religions of community eating). I feel happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys and loves food (while ignoring the ambiance)## The place if often really crowded, which is always the best sign. ##"
4,What a lovely find. Great fish and daily specials all reasonably priced. Also very good mussels when they're in season. It's nice to sit outside in summer but the Glühwein stand in winter is pretty good too.
4,"Wow, what a delight. We went there for dinner and opted for the full 8 course menu. The whole concept is around using some innovative techniques and bold flavours in delicate dishes. The highlights were some veal with chickpeas and ananas. Amazingly powerful and delicate. Wagyu Beef with topinambur and truffles, this was just wow. The rich and melting meat with the truffles were perfect together. Another great dish was some sorbet served in Champagne. I am not a huge fan of Champagne, but combined with the sorbet it worked perfectly. Combined with some great wines and good service this was a very memorable evening. I can only recommend this place."
4,Great location! I was there for the first time and the coffee is very delicious! Nice staff!
4,"Absolutely delicious combinations of ingredients which left me reeling days after I had dinner there! Asparagus season is in full swing and nearly every sea food dish we had incorporated asparagus somehow, whether it be in the sauce or simply accompanying vegetables. Friendly staff there too made it a pleasant evening. It's also possible to sit outside which is nice on warmer evenings. Dessert, namely Spanish style creme caramel with strawberries, asparagus and mint salad, was absolutely scrumptious! Will definitely be recommending this place to friends and returning there myself! Reasonable prices, especially worth it due to quality of food, and all set menus are def worth a try!"
4,This place is just beautiful. It's my favourite city escape. Perfect for walking your dog & Sports! I highly recommend this park! Go there & explore!
3,"Unglaublich groß. Man sollte mit viel Zeit hingehen, um die ganzen kleinen Details wirklich erkennen zu können. Leider war es extrem voll als ich dort war. Eine Wartezeit von über einer Stunden ist wohl auch normal. Aber für Fans ein MUSS!"
3,"We went to Brodersen after a hard but successful day of work in search of a decent reward. All I can say we found it in some delicious German classics that probably did not extend our life expectancy, but felt truly rewarding. I had the ""fischer frühstück""  (omelette with some type of north see shrimp named ""Krabben"") and my friend the pork filets in cream sauce. I always felt that speck is the perfect matrix for pan fried potatoes, and here this was confirmed. All was very delicious. We finished up with two large plates of ""rote grütze"" (jello made with real berries) which was also state of the art...slightly sour and not too sweet containing big fruit chunks. Very nice! I can only recommend this place!"
3,"A good zoo. This place has been run idependantly by the Hagenbeck family for over 100 years and still has a nice, family run feel to it despite its size. They now also have a Troparium with more tropical animals including aligators and sharks. probably best to do the two parts of the park on different visits due to the cost. U2 line or various buses to Hagenbeck's."
3,I feel like the Warehouse district (Speicherstadt) is a time capsule.  There are a lot of old warehouse buildings in this area.  Each warehouse tells a rich story that played a major role in Hamburg's history.  This area is a great place for a stroll and will be more fulfilled if you have a guided tour or read up on it first in a tour book.
3,Quaint little spot. Perfect for a latte and a cake. Very good spot to sit and relax. Nice selection of baked goods and coffee is not too strong. There is a WC in the back which was very clean.
4,"Great food! Great service! Modern and stylish interiorising, and good quality restrooms. (Large portions)"
4,"This spot is really charming; between the lit candles, fresh flowers, wife serving and husband cooking, this is exactly what one might envision when dreaming of European bistro. But let's talk about the food: Traditional Northern German. Unfortunately, I did not have time to research a lot before this trip, and ignorantly I assumed I would be limited to spätzle and sausage. Behold!  Labskaus - an old, traditional sea farer's dish, made from potatoes, pickled beef and beetroot, served with gherkins, beetroot and pickled herring. Labskaus reminds me of a non-greasy, light, almost fluffy corned beef hash. It was topped with 2 farm eggs and was divine. I appreciated that I was going to order a side salad but was advised against it because with the beets and gherkins, that would be too much. How honest! I finished with a spot of peppermint and ginger tea - fresh and strong. Between the reasonable prices, quality food and wonderful service, I would highly recommend this spot.Gluten free dining notes: The Labskaus does not contain bread crumbs, soy sauce nor Worchester sauce. Enjoy!The Creme Brûlée, however, is thickened with flour. :("
4,"Crispy duck is so good here!! I've only ever had takeout, while staying at the Park Hyatt in the same mall complex, but they are prompt and the food is delicious. I keep going back thinking I'll try something else, but seats get the same dish.For foreigners, it is cash only (no international cards)."
2,"Average little thai place. The prices are decent for the Schanze, but the food is only good, not great. Will I go again? Probably not, I know somewhere in St Pauli that I much prefer, and if I wanted a full restaurant experience, then they're also out of luck, because they're not really a restaurant."
3,Pretty decent bar aside all the Reeperbahn turbulences.Very friendly barkeeps which know their profession and will make sure you get the drink you want.
2,"This coffee shop has been hyped as one of the best places in Hamburg for a coffee. For me personally, to test the coffee quality in an outlet specializing in coffee the gold standard is to order an Espresso. What shall I say? Their Espresso is a far cry from a decent Espresso... it looks like a bland blackish puddle produced by a fully automated machine and tastes also like it. No crema, very watery. The only plus is a very fruity and light taste to the coffee, reminding me of a spring flower bouquet. So, coffee quality fairly ok, preparation a no-go. Service is definitely not this spot's strength with both counter attendants minding their own business with an air of utter indifference toward the customer. Maybe this experience is a one-off and I would see a very different atmosphere some other time around. Yet, there won't be another time."
4,Unbelievably good food! I had the quiche and my daughter had the farfalle. Absolutely delicious! We also split the carrot cake. It was moist and light. Must eat there again!
3,"Awesome old-school hip-hop! I came here last night (a Monday). Though it was a bit empty, the Dj was awesome and the drinks, tasty.  Their drink menu is, impressively, extensive. Was not a fan of the cigarette smoke, but it Is Germany, so I guess it comes w/ the territory.  Very friendly bartender and ladies bathroom! If you want a chill, relaxed environment w/ great 90s music, this is your place!"
2,"I was curious because I saw these places all over Hamburg and I love Asian fusion! I have to wait 30 minutes to get my food. Also, I probably have a different working definition of what Asian fusion is...I ordered a vegetarian curry.... It said it came with tofu, but I couldnt really find any on the plate. Plus for an ""imbiss"" this place took forever. But I have to admit, the vegetables were fresh and I liked how they had sauces out on the table. I ordered spicy and although it wasn't spicy enough, I could pile on as much Siracha and chilis as I wanted. (People started to stare.) Everything here is gluten free so I guess that is great if you have food allergies. But really, the majority of asian food just tends to be gluten free in general. No surprise there. This place seemed pretty popular. It was hard to find a seat and I don't really know why. They have locations all over the city and are open late, so it is pretty convenient. Foodwise, it is just like any other semi-palatable Asian place."
4,"As an Asian, I have to say the dish: number 54 reminds me of what I had back in  Asia. Really great and I'm positing this for the Asians, if you want really good 酸笋鸭米粉汤面 ( duck with bamboo, #54)this is the place! There is no other places in Hamburg which has this soup! (in 2015) The service was good and fast. taste exactly like what I expected a Vietnamese restaurant should have. ;) PS : I'm also positing some pictures , which I would recommend to order. ;)"
4,"If you are in Hamburg, and you don't eat lunch or dinner here, I'm gonna be mad at you.Totally perfect. Don't miss it. Great food, great English speaking staff! I had the Maultauchen app and it was awesome, a dumpling filled with meat and spinach. Outstanding flavor. I then moved on to the meatloaf and Spätzle, which was the best I've had in years. The sauce over it all was to die for! I might come back for dinner tonight!"
2,"We tried this place out due to all the positive reviews. We picked up our food and ate at home. First big miss: they forgot to include the Wasabi. Second big miss: big sushi pieces (lots of rice) but too little of the rest....you taste rice more than fish. Finally not really authentic Japanese. The folks there were super nice but I believe either Turkish or something else Middle Eastern. You could tell from the sushi pieces that this place was made for German palates where it's more about filling you up than delivering high end fish. Sure there is a crowd for this and they obviously like this place. If that's your thing, you'll be happy here. I believe the quality is OK and you could do worse. If you are into good sushi though, you may want to go up a class or two in sushi joint. It really is a totally different eating experience getting higher quality stuff. I don't eat sushi to get stuffed. I eat it for the quality and taste and you're just not going to get that at this place. Again super nice people and they do fulfill a very specific niche but this is not truly Japanese grade sushi."
4,"Probably the best pizza in Hamburg!Great lively place, crazy packed so the first challenge is to actually get a table here but if you manage to get it you're in for an experience. Great Italian menu but the pizza's are the highlights.The atmosphere is very lively dark with loud latin music mixed with communal and private tables."
4,"This is my favorite restaurant for a German lunch in Hamburg. If you want a 'lighter' meal, I suggest getting a sandwich. I always get the one with Rindfleisch (beef). Never been disappointed here, always good quality!"
2,"Yesterday I decided to try something new and close to home. I went with my friend to have nice tapas. Overall it was nice, would like to give them 3.5 Starts. The service was slow, it seems they could not handle the amount of people. But the wait shorten when the food came,  in less than 5 minutes after ordering we had almost all our dishes. The tapas where ok. Unfortunately the boquerones were not as fresh as they can be. But either way, everything tasted delicious. The perfect balance from garlic and spicy. Just the Pollo al Limon, was not my thing. In my opinion it was a little pricy for what we got, but for the area I was not so surprised."
2,"Had a moderately-sized schnitzel here for lunch today. It really hit the spot without being amazing. I ordered a Jägerschnitzel (comes with Mushrooms), but those who ordered just a plain schnitzel got monstrously big ones! The service was unintrusive and reasonably prompt. The prices are great. Schnitzel and fries for 5eu :) --- Further to the above review, I've since been back twice. The first time was much the same, but the second time they were incredibly inattentive and slow. It took them literally 15 minutes to notice that our group of 15 had walked through the door. They then took forever to bring a few of the meals, and my schnitzel had a large fraction of inedible gristle in it. I'd still go again, but they're losing a star off the rating."
1,"After experiencing the Amsterdam Dungeon, which assumed everyone attending the attraction at least spoke English, I was excited to visit the Hamburg Dungeon.  What a disappointment.Out of our party, only my Dutch husband understood German, and only at a basic level.  Since I speak Dutch myself, I got the gist of what was going on but my American parents and best friend were left in the dark save for 3 videos that had English subtitles.  We made it known our party was english speakers, but this didn't make much difference.To give the actors credit, some of them did attempt to make the scenes understood.  I was chosen to answer to crimes as a sinner in one scene and the actor easily switched to english.  However, the overall experience as a non-german speaking tourist was disappointing."
3,"Enjoyed a ham omelette and half a bowl of fruit salad with quark, along with my first Fritz-Kola here last Sunday before heading off to see St. Pauli lose. As mentioned by a previous reviewer the need to order at the counter & also go back to pay can result in a bit of standing around as the customer ahead of you may be having half a dozen coffees made for them to cart off, rather than just placing an order or paying but that's just a First world problem to be sucked up. You'll stand around in a lot worse places in your life."
3,"Nice cosy little pub. Service was very friendly, beer was cold. An open air market was happening in the square right next to this place. Good selection of dishes, the wurst salad was quite good.Came back for breakfast on Sunday. Three eggs, potatoes and sausage was fabulous, just the thing after a long night in St. Pauli"
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner here. My galette was stuffed with prosciutto, mushrooms and cheese - you really can't beat that! It was very tasty. My husband did not enjoy his galette because he mistakenly thought ""andouille"" was the New Orleans style spicy sausage. Let's just say this version had too many innards, not enough spice and a funky a metallic scent. He couldn't finish it, but I do not blame the restaurant since it was our ignorance.I recommend reservations or else you might not get a table. We did not have a reservation and they sat us, but advised our time would be limited until the reserved party arrived.Gluten free dining notes: 100% buckwheat crêpes are gluten free, and they will gladly substitute them for the wheat dessert options!"
4,"This is the new branch of the well known Hamburg based burger chain, featuring the famous Blockhouse Burger.The place I often have been to on Jungfernstieg is just too hammered and busy to be fun anymore, so coming here was a real treat. So it's the usual Jim Block quality and service, but with added comfort, plus free gifts for the kids.Very nice."
4,"It's like 5 stars McDonalds. Best meat, wonderful staff and modern enviroment. Best burger in town. I reccomend El Torro, burger in Mexican style."
3,"This was an interesting and educational way to spend two hours on a rainy day in Hamburg. We did the tour which includes decorating your own chocolate bar, learning about the process of chocolate from the raw cocoa pods and importing and then how it's turned into the delicious chocolate at the end. Our tour guide spoke terrific English (check their schedule for what languages are toured at what times) and it was quite educational.Of course, there's a huge chocolate gift shop at the end and how can you not buy a bunch of interesting edible and decorative items to bring home?Expect to eat some chocolate along the way, so don't be too stuffed when you arrive.[Review 12058 overall, 1841 of 2019.]"
4,i eat there once or 2 times a week. the food is always delicious.the employees are friendly and they always offer me a free tea :)
4,It was pretty delicious ! Haven't had such a great falafel  in ages :) thanks ! Will be back soon
4,"Awesome park for a chill time after work and at weekends. There is a huge greenfield, just bring a blanket, some food and you're set. We played viking chess, people asked to join and we had a good time playing viking chess with strangers.Highly recommended!"
3,This wasn't very peaceful place to eat a lunch because the tables were near to each other and the place was full. But I didn't mind anymore as soon as I saw the prices! I didn't know that it's possible to eat fish so cheap... I had my suspicions until I tasted my salmon with peppersauce and it was purely delicious. The salmon was well done and I definitely recommend everyone else taste it as well.
3,"This is a pretty big and nice Irish pub. You've got your typical Guinness and Magners but also surprisingly a large selection of craft beer. I had the 'Zweitel' and that was pretty damn good. This is a great place to hang out with others but as I came to watch the footie; they have 2 TVs on which they show games, it was a little disappointing with the music playing and no game sounds being heard hence the loss of a star. Great bar to hang but not super great to watch football in my opinion."
0,"The taste of the food here is very mediocre. We were very interested in this place because of our obsession with potato dishes. Very disappointing. The place itself is very cool, but... the final thing that did it for me was seeing a mouse run by the table. The place has dark lighting which is probably why most people did not see it. I told the server and he said that it was normal as they are located in a basement and surrounded by water. When I saw the mouse a second time, it had returned from the other side of the dinning room and was very close to our table. I decide we'd had enough. I asked for the bill and they not only provided zero discounts, but the serve had the audacity to point out that tips had not been charged on the bill. I simply paid (NO tips) and decided to never return.."
3,"Scandinavian style, with wooden tables. They also have toys and books to keep the kids entertained. The menu is in german but the waitress kindly translated it for us. They have tasty dishes for an healthy lunch."
2,"First to make things clear, I am not a student nor on a budget. I've also had the benefit of eating steak in some of the best places in and outside of Germany hence my hurdle for quality meat is quite high. Hopi, located so close to my home, is unfortunately a disappointment. Having moved here recently I was looking for the occasion to try this place out. From the reviews here I was expecting to be wow'ed. Well, didn't quite happen. This is an older place and the interior is going downhill. Nicely maintained yet aging in terms of design. Even Block House with it's old school flair seems a bit more modern. Not a big deal though. This is a very subjective issue. Unfortunately where things went wrong for me was with the food. I had the ribeye steak. Prepared and served just like at Block House with the salad and garlic bread. The meat was horrible. I ordered it medium rare and it was gummy and bland. This was not good meat and if it were prepared by a gourmet chef would probably still not taste well. The garlic bread was ok but on the dry side. The salad very simple and the dressing forgettable. Don't get me wrong. For the cheap prices here, it's a good way to get your steak on. Once you've finished studying or received your first paycheck, it's time to move on. Yes, Block House is more expensive but the meat is consistent. Butchers, Meatery or the place in Afrikahaus are all better.On a side note, our waitress was super nice. We had the lady with the short, blonde hair and she really was a sweetheart. Unfortunately, the old guy (who I presume was the owner) was in the middle of a heated fight with the Asian lady at the end of the night. We were the last guests and these two really went at, insulting each other loud enough that we had ringside seats. We were amused but it didn't do much to lure us back in the future. ""Professional"" is defined otherwise."
2,The long line gave me a headache but in the end it was worth it !
2,"Have to agree with previous review, trendy enough but I was irritated by the micro-portions. A few grams of food are not going to be enough to fill you. In fairness, what food there was did taste good."
2,"Wonderful position on the Alster, very nicely arranged and designed. On other hand its quite expensive and waiters are unfriendly. I go there sometimes to bring our friends visiting Hamburg for first time because of nice location but the place is definetely not my favorit."
2,"As expected, your typical Hofbrau house with the traditional hall seating setup! Traditional food as well with 1L beers at reasonable (but slightly pricier) prices. Recommend stopping by for the experience! Can also make reservations. They sell the steins and mugs as well."
4,"When I moved to HH from California, I thought that I would never find a bowl of guacamole, let alone a decent enchilada. Then I found Cafe Mexico. This is the real deal. The family who runs this charming cafe come from Mexico City, and they cook The Best enchiladas in Hamburg. The mole (a rich dark sauce made with chocolate, spices and nuts) is heavenly. The chilaquiles are great too...come to think of it, EVERYTHING is tasty here. And the tequila selection....yummmmmmmm. The decor is right out of Mexico, with the Virgin of Guadalupe and lots of cacti watching over the diners. Love it! And the service is just as it is in Mexico--mellow and friendly. Prices are quite reasonable. Cafe Mexico is a bright spot of sunshine. When friends say that they've never eaten Mexican food (or they think Mexican is just fajitas or Tex-Mex), we bring them here. I would eat here once a week if I lived closer to the Schanze!"
4,"My favourite Italian restaurant ever. Reasonable prices, great menu and great service. Some of the best service I've had in Germany - not that there's much competition."
4,This place was humming on a Wednesday night. Luckily we had made reservations. Parking in the area was a nightmare. Better use public transportation. But it was worse it. We did had to wait some time to get the attention of the waiter. Staff was nice and courteous. Will definitely come again.
3,"This place is a standout for us and almost comfort food when we are in town.  This location is near the University and has diverse clientele. The bathrooms are clean and most of the staff speak English to some degree. Additionally, there are two possibilities for ordering: the normal sit down meal with cloth napkins on one side or the takeout/less posh tables on the side with the corner door.  We usually opt for the latter option unless it is a special occasion as it is 15-25% cheaper. Great place for a date or an informal business dinner. WELL behaved puppies are welcome as long as they sit under the table. The food is great and they have a Pakistani twist on some of you favorite ""Indian"" dishes."
4,"This museum was really amazing. It reminded me of the Natural History Museum in NYC, but without the barriers between you and the animals. You could get really close to the preserved animals and it made for a very interesting experience that really gave you a better sense of what the animals are like (you don't realize how big a grizzly is until you stand up next to it)."
4,Excellent omelette with ham and cheese. Very helpful translating to English. Cozy atmosphere.
3,"I passed this café a hundred times, but now I made it inside! And here you go:Service: Very cute. And friendly and quick. I just do not know if she would have been able to speak German as well. Pancakes with maple syrup: Just great! Verrrrry yummy. Way too much, but as it was that yummy there was no way not to eat up everything..Ambiance: Not overwhelming, but the pancakes make up for it, promise. Remarkable (and surely a matter of taste): A hotchpotch of very colorful cups. Definitively worth a try.  : )"
4,"So I have had some good Italian meals and last night we came here as a work group and some visitors from out of town. This experience was pretty special.We all went for the taster menu and the whole thing was just fantastic.15 year old super viscous Balsamic vinegar, extra first pressed Sicilian olive oil, angel hair spaghetti with truffles, carpaccio of smoked tunafish, melt in the mouth Tiramisu great wine, and really good service.A really good place to enjoy incredible Sicilian Italian food outside on a warm evening. Not the cheapest, but one of the best."
4,"My fav stop in Hamburg. Best vibes, good music, good people, lovely bartenders"
4,"Lovely café with some places downstairs and more upstairs. One room upstairs is furnished like a livingroom of your grandma could be, with some cozy armchairs, sofas, coffee tables and wallpapered walls!I can't tell if the breakfast there is good, because I couldn't snatch a free table. But I assume it really is, because the seats to brunch on a sunday are fully booked two weeks in advance! SO MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION EARLY ENOUGH! Tip: if this place is crowded, go to the café called Caffeé Latte. It's just a few metres down the street and not as big as that place. They have some nice breakfasts as well!"
4,"全汉堡最好吃的pho！ Best beef pho in Hamburg. Came at dinner time, the place is crowded with hipsters. The food was really really great, especially the soup in the pho. It has the rich flavor of beef, or in Chinese ""鲜"". I tried ice green tea this time, it is just ok, but my friends ordered lime ginger soda, she said it was good. Maybe try some other drinks next time."
4,"Ich kenne den Laden bestimmt schon seit 25 Jahren, mit meinem Mann bin ich zum Stammkunden geworden, als wir in der Nähe wohnten. Leider ist das nicht mehr der Fall, aber zu bestimmten Gelegenheiten ist ein dinner im 'la Pergola' zur Tradition für und geworden.Großartig die fluffigen weichen Brötchen mit Basilikumpesto, die als Gruß aus der Küche kommen. Man muß aufpassen, daß man sich daran nicht schon satt isst.Ansonsten: toller Service, leckeres Essen, moderate Preise, kuschelige Atmoshäre, ich persönlich liebe das Lammfilet mit Dijon Senf Sauce, und für uns beide ist die Rindercarpaccio mit reichlich frischen Champignons, Parmesan und Rucola oder das Vitello Tonnato ein Muß.Reservierung ist ratsam, die Plätze am Rand sind gemütlicher als in der Mitte und immer schnell voll."
3,Very satisfying pizza. Crunchy thin crust. Many toppings to choose from including pineapple and tofu. Vegan friendly options. Nice seating at wood tables. Menu available in German and English language.
3,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Joh Albrecht. Been there several times. If I have friends visiting Hamburg, it is probably the place I take them to. They got a good view of the canal if you are lucking getting a table next to the window. They have really good Flammkuchen. I've ordered it every time I got there. I've tried schweinshaxe and schnitzel once or twice. Not impressive. Beer is good though. The place is good for group. They have a lot of long tables."
4,"Good donairs - crisply roasted bread with chunky lamb meat including enough fatty bits, fresh salad, good sauces - check!Good value for money - be seated with your Mini Döner - check!Friendly staff - check!Cosy in- and exterior in wood and warm colors that feel like Turkey and not like a fast food parlor, including good bathrooms - check!But what really clinches the 5***** is that they seem to be the only(!) donair place in Hamburg that still serves the more expensive lamb meat (for a modest surcharge), which is of course the original Turkish donair meat. Döner Queen nearby doesn't do so any longer - Dubara are the real donair deal."
4,"Sehr stylischer Laden und die Pizza ist auch lecker.Die Pizza ist zum selberkonfigurieren und dann am besten draußen essen und ein bischen Menschen schaun, das ist auf St. Pauli ja immer eher unterhaltsam."
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Sagner's, and tried the northern German specialty labskaus.  The restaurants was a short walk from my hotel, and also was totally local. Luckily they had English menus, and the hostess was quite helpful and could speak English. I also sipped on a tasty local beer. Well priced also."
4,"This was the most amazing food I tasted in months! The hejpapa-crew didn't pay me for saying this  they just surprised me with quality food, best coffee (as good as kopiba coffee) and very good service. People, you should come here.Last not least, they have free WLAN."
4,"This is not your typical Turkish German restaurant or donair place (although they do serve a great variety of donairs): great quality food, very friendly staff who visibly care about the food they cook fresh, nice seating both in- and outdoors - and all this for a very reasonable price. Impressed."
2,We were there during the happy hour. Our sahne cocktails were very very sweet and probably had no alcohol. It was not as expected at all and that is the 3 stars. Although their ambience is quite nice & the service is fast & good!
3,"We stumbled upon this place on a Sunday during a recent trip to Hamburg.   It appears to be family owned and a very friendly restaurant as well.   We had several interesting dishes fresh fish, potatoes soup and my daughter's favorite a sort of perogi casserole.   We have had to recreate this and it has become a family favorite.   Nice view on the canal too."
3,"I daresay I liked this little restaurant as much as any bistro I ate at while visiting Paris!Le Plat du Jour has a traditional fixed course French menu dinner setup - 30 euros to pick one from each of three courses. There is one ""plat du jour"" representing the nightly special you can elect for your entree.I started with a salad but my co-diners got the pate. I have to admit I was a little food envious looking at their plates! The mains were all very nice - our table had a fish, some sort of very rich looking liver dish, and the ""plat du jour"" involving chicken drumsticks. All with requisite amounts of butter and French sauce, right in the middle of Hamburg."
3,"Update:I'm here without dogs and babies, so my experience is different from other negative reviews I've read. I can see the appeal of this place: it lies in its well-designed, cozy, country-style atmosphere, in its warmth. December 29, 2012Darn! Nothing on their Facebook page says they would be closed for Christmas. :("
4,"Rodizio is one of my fave restaurant here in Hamburg. The price is abit steep, but for the amount of food you will get at their eat-all-you-can , it is worth it esp for meat lovers. The 'servers' go around with their meats/side dishes from table to table. They will serve it to you straight to your plate. If it's a meat, they will slice it infront of you. You need to book with them 3-4weeks in advance if you wish to dine with them on a Saturday night. If you are looking for a ""quiet"" place to dine, this is NOT for you. If you wanted to go for 'ala carte', again - this place is NOT for you."
3,"Really cute crepes place with delicious crepes! This place gets really packed sometimes as it may be a little touristy but the crepes quality is great! We walked in over the weekend and managed to grab a table for 2 fairly easily. Seems like if you have a larger group or are coming at peak times, you may want to make a reservation ahead of time.Once we got seated, we started with just 2 cups of espresso. Later on I found out I should have ordered one of the ciders. I did see the table next to us order a bottle of cider and poured it into 2 cute tea cups! Ahhh I should have ordered that! Next time! Ok so we had our espressos which were great! then we ordered our savory crepes and also put in an order for our dessert ones. I don't remember the names of our savory crepes but really everything is really good so just pick one! For the dessert crepes we had the plain sugar with butter and also a nutella crepe. Nutella crepes are always delish but I find it a little to rich for my taste. I enjoyed my simple desert crepe. I really wanted the crepe with sugar and lemon but forgot to order the lemon. It was still really good but yes, I need to come back here! :)Overall it's a great place for an afternoon crepe if you are sightseeing or just want a lighter lunch!"
3,Nice restaurant in a distinguished area of Hamburg center. Persian cuisine is well-known for its savoury dishes. Its worth the visit to enjoy the main course and their appetisers.
4,"Good food good service good prices. I would definitely come back when in town. Not the best of areas, but if you're close to the station, it's worth a visit."
3,"I really should come here more often, considering that it's across the street from me. I like it here because it makes for both a great coffee shop during the day and a really nice (albeit a quite loud) bar during the evening. They serve soy-based drinks, which is a major plus, and coffee until late. Need to remember to come here on a wednesday for some live jazz!"
4,"Due to the very good yelp reviews, we decided to have dinner at this restaurant. Believe me... this restaurant is excellent!!!! You should definitely try the fish dishes! The restaurant is very central and close to the Alster. Inside the restaurant decoration is cozy and very welcoming. The service was excellent. She was always checking if we have everything and if we need anything. Very friendly and communicative.My husband and I decided to order a fish dish.The plaice was served with little shrimps, roast potatoes and side salad. It was soooooo DELICIOUS!!! The portion was really good. We are excited to go there again pretty soon!"
3,"What can I say about Loving Hut-Vegan?? First of all I am not a Vegan by any means but I followed some co-workers the other day for lunch and we ended up here. It is a nice, small location with a busy lunch crowd. When we arrived the place was fully packed and we had to wait about 5 minutes before we could be seated. Once we were seated it took a good 10-15 minutes before the waiter finally came over.I ordered the Thai Curry which was pretty good. For around 7€ I got the main dish plus a starter of my choice. I choose the spring rolls which were also tasty. Overall the food was pretty good, nothing to remember though. The service is what took this from a 5 star to a 4 star. There seemed to be only the 1 server and a lady who only cleaned the tables.I would probably come back though which is a good thing."
2,I found the atmosphere to be very cool. The place was full. A friend and I from Canada have been on a mission to find awesome Asian street food. This place unfortunately did not deliver. We ordered the spring rolls to start. The filling was good but the spring was burnt. For our mains I ordered the chicken pho and I asked for extra veggies like in the veggie pho. The broth was ok. The noddles and  veggies were also over cooked. My friend ordered the crispy noodles with beef and veggies. She liked her dish  but didn't love it. I don't know if I would go back. My go to Asian street food is still Quan Do in the city! It's amazing !
4,"Mr Kebab has another follower! This place seems to function as a hybrid of a proper restaurant and a fast food joint, and they've succeeded in keeping the best of both worlds. Fast service, cheap, but top quality food in pleasant surroundings, and unlike most kebab places I've known they also serve beer and other alcoholic beverages. The menu is extensive and portions are generous. I ordered the Iskender Kebab, a bowl of meat - wonderfully tender and juicy - and bread covered (entirely) in garlic yoghurt. Delicious."
4,"Das Terzetto ist zu meinem Stammitaliener geworden. Ich habe dort schon meine Eltern, fast alle meiner Freunde und auch Kollegen hingeführt. Das Essen ist wirklich außerordentlich gut, der Service typisch italienisch ;-) und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis absolut in Ordnung.In der dazugehörigen Bar nebenan habe ich kürzlich zusammen mit einer Freundin unseren Geburtstag mit 40 Leute gefeiert (geschlossene Gesellschaft). Unsere Wünsche wurden alle erfüllt. :-)) Würde ich wieder machen!"
4,"Excellent location, cheap and delicious fast food. Atmosphere is great, and the guys who work there are really personable. I've become a regular. :)"
4,"First time visiting Hamburg and happened upon this gem! This is the most fantastic pizza...I love it...seriously. #likeseriouslybestpizzaeverPros:*As I said, it's one of the best pizzas I've had. Worth every penny.*Quick; ordered when I got there and it was ready in about 10 minutes (no line when I arrived)*Friendly; every employee was kind and had a smile; they were very patient with the ""unsure American"", lol*English-speaking; much to my benefit, the employees spoke English -- I would not have been able to order otherwise.Cons:*small place; not appropriate for a sit-down meal if that's what you want*can be pricy; I got a ""large"" (medium by U.S. standards) with ""all the meats"" (which actually surprised the employees, lol) and paid about 13EUR -- but also like I said, worth every penny!*maybe not the best place/location/area of town for small children*CASH ONLY (I've found this is rather typical around the area in general, but this place only takes cash...be prepared)"
4,Best sushi ever! Really fresh. The tuna sashimi! Nomnonnomnomnonnomnnmmm! Really nice Staff! It was saterday and nog even half full.. they really not deserve that ! Good price for good  what Else do you want?
4,"Food was great, didn't have to wait for long till the food came, waitress was super friendly! Loved it and highly recommended this Vietnamese restaurant :)"
4,"My dad took me to his favorite restaurant where he feels like home the food is always consistent and real delicious. The service in incredible nice and are super friendly The restaurant is clean and has a fun vibe My dad got a noodle dish and he loved it, my dish was super yummy (liver and fresh mashed potatoes with applesauce .personally like the weekly flyer they hand out so you know the dishes  daily.The service is super nice and friendly And the owner is very nice and helpful"
3,"first time here. Came with a group of people, actually 20 people. Really great for group. Food is great. I order extra no 4, it was pork and lamb skew mix with fries. The meat was nicely grilled. The guy next to me ordered a lamb plate, also looking really good. Probably gonna try it next time. Well, what is funny is I just found out lemonade in Germany is actually sprite. Well maybe I will try beer here next time."
3,"Little surprised to see this place get only 3.5 stars, since I think pretty much everything about it is great. (""Yay! I'm a fan,"" even.)Ambience: trendy, modern - great lighting.Food: well-prepared, nicely presented. The fruit with muesli for breakfast is a choice way to start the day; the half-salad/half-soup lunch combo was fantastic the day I had it.Coffee: Does the job! They also have a pretty full range of espresso drinks."
1,Service is good after a little waiting time you get seated! Burgers don't take long. Ordered a rare farmers burger but got a burger grilled well done. After asking if that's the rare burger they just said sorry this happens when it's busy. That's it...Beer is alright. Sides are good.
2,"So many people had recommended Herr Max to us, so I looked forward to breakfast here.We ordered two different breakfasts, two coffee and two orange juices and the girls working here totally mixed it all up and forgot half of our order. When we finally got it all it both looked and tasted really good, and the café is really charming as well. I wish that I could give the café a better ranking, but unfortunately I found the service too bad for that. The girls forgot orders, ran around looking stressed behind the counter and had no order in what they were doing. And that's just stressful to watch as a customer, even if the food/cakes are good."
3,"Take the general cool chic of the Schanze, pick a great location in one of the old slaughterhouses and then add in a TV chef and a minimalist menu. That's Bullerei. The prices are surprisingly cheap - about EUR8 for a meal + Astra beer. The food isn't particularly amazing though. It seems to be basic stuff, done better than average. I had chicken drumsticks with a pasta salad and Astra for EUR7.50. It was decent without being great. It's generally really busy, so although they have huge tables that would be great for groups, you might find it hard to get seating for more than 2-4 people. I'll probably try it again sometime.."
2,"I don't normally go out for asian food (apart from sushi) since it has a tendency to either be meat-based or spicy (none of which I eat), but decided to take a shot at joining my coworkers for lunch here. I had the saitan dish - not that I had any choice whatsoever as it was the only vegetarian dish on the menu. The waitress warned me that it would have a ""basic spiciness"" but seeing as it was either that dish or no dish, I ordered it anyway. HOLY MOTHER JESUS OF NAZERETH THIS THING WAS SPICY. And delicious. And spicy. Too spicy. I couldn't finish my meal - had to run over to the bakery to pick up an egg sandwich instead. Have IBS like me? Don't go here."
0,"My husband and I tried Chicago Meatpackers a couple of times and I've been sorely disappointed. The first time they ran out of hamburger buns. Hamburgers are their specialty so it goes without saying it was a disappointment. The second time, we ordered burgers and I didn't think the meat tasted very fresh. In fact, it had a strange and unappealing taste. I won't be going back."
4,"If you like interior design, you'd be pretty much satisfied in this little austrian café. Fine cakes (e.g. Sacher, Frankfurter Kranz), very delicous. And in case you are not looking for typical austrian flourfood (mehlspeisen), the hearty snacks have my recommendation as well. ""Weisswurst und Brezn"" with sweet mustard, as well as beef meatballs with salad for less than 7 euro in that kind of athmosphere, marvelous. Drinks are sort of pricy, but for the location still affordable."
2,"Slightly cozier than sister locale mi-chii with all its concrete, the original O-ren Ishii is still geared toward fast eating prior to dinner hours, with five changing dishes every day, all around 10-13€. Benches and stools are simple, hard, with very few seats even boasting as much as a backrest.Food started more pleasantly, with a delicious spicy home-made lemonade. This was followed by absolutely brilliant spring rolls; airy, crispy, just perfection on a bed of fresh herbs. Do not miss out on those if you eat here!Unfortunately, my main course let me down again: I got a Vietnamese-style rice bowl with a generous helping of chicken, but they somehow managed to make a ginger-chili sauce dull and boring. A spicy, bland dish, and no other sauces or dressings available to at least dilettante things up...As much as I loved the starter course: the bland main, as well as the uncomfortable seating would not entice me back."
3,Weekly menu with a handful of different dishes plus a selection of wines. The prices are fair and the food was good. You definitely have to reserve a table for dinner times. They also offer outdoor seating with extra heaters.
1,"OK, there is definately better sushi in this world than this place. I used to go to the Sushi Circle in Frankfurt, where there wasn't an all-you-can-eat option, and the cuts of fish were better and the selection significantly better. Very long waiting times when the all-you-can-eat special is on offer and as already written, extremely tight seating. I believe if you want to save money, the place to go, but do you really want to ""save money"" when eating sushi (it's RAW fish)? I rather eat ""Fischstäbchen"" from the microwave and save up cash for a really good sushi restaurant once in a while."
2,"I dig Burgerlich for the very novel ordering system. If you sit inside, every seat has its own pop-up order screen. If you're not native German speakers like we are, this is a super easy way to order. All items on the menu have correlating pictures so you know exactly what you're getting. We both ordered the cheeseburger, mine with a fried egg and his with bacon. We also ordered a side salad and onion rings. The food came out fast! I was impressed. The burger itself tasted OK. The patty was maybe a little too bland for my taste. I did very much like the tomato relish spread on the bottom bun. I would've wanted extra of that. The brioche bun was also rather awesome. It held the burger together very well. The salad was nothing special, but we did really like the onion rings. The batter was super crispy and I enjoyed the touch of rosemary in the batter.This is a great place for a quick burger fix and to bring a big group of people. Everyone can easily order what they want and pay individually since you pay up front with a card that you use to scan in your order. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the place itself is a really cool looking spot. Though the burgers aren't the best I've had, I would come back with friends in tow."
4,Wow! Words can't describe how amazing this food is. Fish as fresh as can be and prepared on the spot. It's a cute but very small restaurant near the Alster. Everything is 100% German. :)
3,"I came here with some friends for a Monday evening dinner. The place was absolutely packed, so I'd definitely recommend a reservation if you're heading there outside of lunch. Luckily, we had one and were seated within a few minutes of arriving even though our party of 3 wasn't entirely here yet.The decor and ambience is certainly unique. In a good way, that is. The walls are decked out with what seems like a random collection of flea market finds, and the entirely unrelated music selection works to complete the experience. The waiters are also super high energy and witty, with an almost relentless desire to practice their heavily Italian-accented English. Our table was in a back corner, which made it easy to chat despite the somewhat loud setting. I'm not sure if that would also apply with the more central tables in the space.My friends recommended the pizzas over the pastas, and that seemed to match past reviews as well as what I saw around me. I got the Prosciutto e Funghi pizza. It's probably the best pizza I've had in Hamburg: really thin dough that's nicely charred from their wood-burning oven with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. These pizzas are huge, probably over 14"" in diameter, but the thin dough and toppings makes for a lighter meal than your typical, smaller pizza.At the end of the meal, they drop off the check along with bottles of grappa and sambuca and shot glasses for you to pour away. It's a nice way to end the meal even if the gesture felt a little robotic. The fruit chews accompanying that felt a little out of place, though.If you're in search for a good pizza in Hamburg or just a fun dinner out, definitely check out Luigis."
1,"I don't know why this place gets such high ratings. Honestly, the guy behind the bar was totally unfriendly, I didn't feel welcome at all and he didn't use pleases or thank yous or anything like that, he didn't even point out that the kumpir on top of the counter was mine, until I asked him. Apart from the fact the service sucks, the place was a mess as well, the guys behind the bar just seemed more interested in listening to their music than keeping the place clean. The food was okay, I have to be honest, but it was expensive at nearly 4 Eur, where there are better bargains to be had only a few metres down the road to the right at Falafelstern, where you get great service and a huge falafel for only 3,50 Eur.I am sure the people behind the bar are not the owners, owners know how hard it is to earn a buck and it's a shame I have to resort to writing a review like this, the date I went was Sunday 9 June 2013 at 5pm. Maybe if the owner reads this he knows who was on shift that day and can fire them."
0,"DON'T GO TO SCHWEINSKE, DON'T GO TO ANY OF SCHWEINSKE'S RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!WHY?It's not that I've experienced bad service or had a fight with some waiter, it's just bad because the food is horrible.Why would someone pay 20 times more then you could buy the same food in supermarkets and heat it up in the microwave? Well that's is actually what Schwinske does.NOTHING IS FRESH. N O T H I N G.And I think someone who ownes such a chain and serve such bad food for that price, that person must be evil haha. I'm serious.IT'S A RIP OFF.I saw many times how they prepare the food. They just take it out form cans and/or defrost something.And the breakfast offer is just  H O R R I B L E. Haha Do yourself a favor, be a little classy and spend a little more time, but the same money for some better restaurants to eat. Heeeyyyy that's why we have YELP :D"
4,"I should have come sooner, this place is everything I want in a coffeeshop! When I stopped off on a Saturday morning, I got a perfect V60 pour over coffee and some delicious eggs on toast. The atmosphere is warm and inviting inside, plenty of wood, with a nice view of the Hamburg canals. There is a large upstairs area with plenty of seating, if you want to stay for awhile.While they offer several different ways to make your coffee, don't be overwhelmed and talk with the staff about what you like, they are really friendly. They have a variety of beans, so you can definitely try a few combos and taste many different things. They do their roasting and sell their beans too, if you want to take things home. I can tell, I will be coming back here regulary!"
2,A regular Starbucks place with nice and interesting interior and a truly nice views of the lake
4,"Looking for organic food in Hamburg, Google found this for us. It is truly a little paradise. Our host Peter Kühn took great care of Colleen and me!"
4,"The staff is extremely friendly, the atmosphere transports you to the streets of Italy and the coffee and food are great too! It does not get any better. ** They only accept cards for orders over 10 euro (found that out the hard way - but they were nice enough to allow me to come back later to pay for my cappuccino!)"
4,Best place to go before or after enjoying a movie in the cinema METROPOLIS  next door.
2,Das Essen ist ganz gut und der Service ist auch sehr nett. Aber irgendwie fehlt mir hier der pfiff. Warum kann ich auch nicht genau sagen aber bisher war ich 2x da und ich war nicht ganz überzeugt aber ich komme bestimmt wieder!
2,"It's ok (for a Vietnamese). Good selection, nice ambience and a place you can take your friends to for Vietnamese food. The food is average I would say but value isn't that great. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in town."
3,"Amazing displays, super crowded, but a fun place for kids and adults. Def. book advanced tickets. There's a helpful charging stations with all kinds of cords to plug your phone in if you have exhausted its battery by taking too many pictures, lol."
4,"Wonna try good Hamburg fish...?? You can't miss Fisch & Co.! Really cozy restaurant (with just 3 tables) that prepares fresh fish on-the-fly. Dishes are delicious...I suggest to give a try at fish and chips...the best that I took in my life! Please note that the restaurant is really small. On rainy days it's really hard to get a seat, so good for takeaways, but not for long seating lunches..."
0,"High expectations, with zero outcome. Totally overpriced and tasteless.  The bar was loaded with unwashed glasses. Bartenders didn't wear masks and handled food without gloves, then wiped their hands on their pants. The raviolis with bacon were undercooked and the bacon could barely be cut. After waiting 2 hours for the main dish , The Spätzle was a disaster. Zero flavor and completely watered down. When I mentioned it to the kitchen, I was told they ran out of cheese. As if I wouldn't notice. Definitely would avoid this overpriced and over hyped , poorly managed ""celebrity restaurant."""
4,"AMAZING! Kittles has done everyone in the Qype community a great service by finding out what the hell this bar is actually called. We don't have the concept of nameless bars in the UK, but in works well here. This place is always busy, in a good way. Sofas that would look hideous in your own living room really fit in well with the downbeat decor, think, faded grandeur with a bit of damp. Great place to meet people as you have to sit next to them. Check it out."
1,"For my (maybe spoilt?) liking sadly the most boring breakfast throughout the whole Schanze. I refer to the Kostbar süß (sweet) now which had the character of a loveless canteen meal: tiny plastic packs of honey (1), Nutella (1), jam (1), cream cheese (1) and butter (1) slapped on a plate.Plus 2 biiiiig, flavourless rolls and a tragic slice of tomato, melon and cucumber. For the price of this (approx. 5 Euro without a coffee) I've had many much better breakfasts around town. Quite a letdown being only topped off by the bored and inattentive waitress. (- And they follow this pattern during the summertime, too, when you wish to sip a beer outside You could do a runner five times until these girls come to collect your money or orders.)"
3,"Apparently, Hamburg does have a beach. It's just hiding in the tiki bars.In all seriousness, it's a relaxing place. Chill out with a Mai Tai, get your butt in a lounge chair, take your shoes off and get them into that sand. On a sunny day, just ignore the container ships going by and you've got yourself an oasis."
3,Hands down Hamburg's currywurst beats Berlin's. The juicy sausage is packed with flavor and has the perfect snap as you bite into it.  Curry powder was flawless and not too overpowering - it was unforgettably mouthwatering and conveniently located in the most charming little city!
4,"Fabulous!! FIRST: make a reservation! SECOND: eat the entire pizza. We had a party of six with a reservation and were seated within minutes and served some of the best food of our lives. Do t miss this place!! Fun, loud and cramped in all the best ways."
1,Not very interesting. The display is a bit old fashioned. And just for the ones who like me use to carry with them a purse that is not a very small one you will be firmly asked to let it at the entrance The two main interests for us were the cozy restaurant and the bookstore.
4,"Jimmy Elsass is a bit of a cult favorite among friends and coworkers, so I'm under a lot of pressure to give them anything but five stars. But then again, they've earned it on every single one of my visits. The space itself is a bit dark and dreary (very reminiscent of Hamburg itself), but the service is friendly and helpful, and the food and drink are excellent. ""Elsass"" is German for Alsace, and the menu is dominated by flammkuchen, the Alsatian baked flatbread specialty, with all kinds of toppings. I always get something different, and they're all good, but you can't go wrong with an original (cream, onions, lardons). The wine is also dominated by Alsatian options, all of which are also quite good. The waiters mostly speak English, and they only accept cash payment. Give it a try."
3,"Very nice bar in the heart of Altona/Ottensen district - don't even try an attempt to come by car - either walk or if 5-10 minutes walk is too far, take a taxi/cab. They have 2 areas to sit outside - left and right of the entrance. No tables though, just some benches (beer garden style). Drinks are not better or worse than in other bars, but I like the atmosphere and you will directly spot why this place is called ""Reh"" (""Deere"") when coming inside."
4,"A cosy place, next to u2 Hauptbahnhof. From ordering to getting food is just in a short while. Totally in  with their chicken avocado bowl. Absolutely recommend this place for everyday healthy lunch"
4,"This was such a highlight of our trip to Hamburg. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the ordering concept is cool and easy, and the food is fantastic. The burgers, which they specialize in, are very tasty. I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. Unlike other reviewers I found the cheese to be perfectly melted. Also I ordered my burger medium-well and and it was perfectly cooked. The real winner at Burgerlich, however, is the pulled pork sandwich. My husband had it and i had such food envy. It is by far the best pulled pork sandwich I've tried anywhere in Germany and I would highly recommend it. The burgers are great, but the pulled pork sandwich is even better! The fries are really well done, crispy and perfectly seasoned. As the portions are pretty big it's possible to share fries between a couple. They have other sides like chips and salads as well. The prices are reasonable, especially for the food. Drink costs are a bit steep, but this is typical of most restaurants. The overall atmosphere is more on the hip and cool side. There was a dj playing pop music, which could be loud for some people, but we really enjoyed it. Overall I would highly recommend this place."
3,"This place was great. In the lovely Portuguese quarter. The pizza we had was delicious, and the service was nice."
3,"Delicious and authentic buckwheat French galettes (crepes). The space here is lively, bright, and feels like that of a European country home-like atmosphere in a historical building that overlooks the canal. Good food and nice location...yeah, it's no wonder it's popular and why you should probably make a reservation.Both savory crepes that my wife and I ordered were delicious -- some of the best -- and prepared promptly despite how busy the restaurant was. I really don't think you could go wrong with any single one on the menu. We had some difficulty choosing because they all sounded very appetizing. We will definitely be back!"
4,"Super friendly staff that made you feel like you were in Italy until you stepped back out in the Hamburg rain. The pizza was amazing and I managed to finish one on my own, which is rare, but it was so good I simply couldn't stop."
4,"First of all, you probably want to make a reservation. I dropped by for dinner on a weeknight without a reservation, and they basically said ""We're completely booked but you can sit here for an hour."" I guess I should have known based on how full they were that the crepes would be really good.I had the L'Apetit, which is a standard ""ham, egg, and cheese"" galette topped with spinach, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. It tasted far better than standard, however! The galette was perfectly cooked, just a little bit crispy on the outside. The ham, egg, and cheese combination was already really good, but the toppings were all surprisingly tasty as well. Each was flavored a little bit differently and the combination of flavors (plus the crispy galette) worked really, really well.The atmosphere is like sitting in a cafe in France, so you might get a little confused about where you're located in the world! Staff are friendly and fluent in English. There's also an English menu available if you, like me, don't speak German. Prices are pretty decent at around 10 euros for a savory galette.I've had galettes in other parts of the world, including France, and this place is near the top of the list. I was too full to try out a sweet crepe, but I'd like to come back someday!"
4,"Affordable, tasty, and excellent service. I only had the pea soup but I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, as my meal was delicious and everything around me looked lovely too."
2,"I was having a nice stroll as I often do in this gorgeous Hafencity I live in, and stumbled up this cafe, tucked inside a brick building around the corner from the Speicherstadt.  The decor really draws you in because there pasty case boasts a nice selection of desserts alongside a bar that opens up to a seating area blended into a mini gift shop filled with books, cards and such. I chose a window seat so that I could not only peek outside but get an overall view of the room.  Great place to lounge with friends because the layout is open and cosy. It feels more like you are sitting in someone's home dining table than in a cafe/restaurant. The meals range from light and healthy to rich and hearty homemade dishes.  I happened to be in the mood for wine and a dessert so I ordered the Kaiserschmarrn.  The wine was very nice, she suggested a glass of French,  Côtes du Rhône.  I really love this dessert, Kaiserschmarrn tastes to me similar of a thick pancake but with the sweet flavors of a sugary donut and served often with a side of berries or sauce.  My favorite is when they serve it with vanilla ice-cream, a dopple of whip cream and sprinkled with a few fresh strawberry slices. Here it was served mainly plain and a bit overcooked and too sugary.  I ate it nonetheless, but would it have been a bit fluffier and moist, I would have enjoyed it more.There is a lunch buffet for those in the area looking for a quick stop, as most people frequenting this area are there for work or tourists taking in the many sights. The main menu is very German with a mixture of Austrian and Northern traditional Hamburg recipes served. Meat and fish are the main components and though it is not an extensive menu of options, there are enough fine choices and it really does feel like a home cooked meal and atmosphere. Prices are a bit higher for such a cosy looking cafe, but I imagine it has much to do with the location being nestled in the main Harbor and historical landmark of the warehouse area.I had the Hamburger Pannfisch once for lunch and it was delicious.  This location is really great to go with a friend for cafe and dessert or even a nice quiet dinner if you happen to be in the area or it is also great for going alone and relaxing with your own thoughts after a nice walk along the Speicherstadt.  During the day, a good spot for a casual meeting on one of the sofas near the window."
3,"When in Sternchanze, Herr Max is one of the must-do's.Because you will want to.It's a little shop/café with homemade pastry offering a selection of freshly self-made cookies, tarts, cupcakes and cakes, each day slightly different ones. You can take it away (and buy one of their delicious marmalades of quite extravagant tastes, too)or please sit in, if you find a nice corner.Within its white and pastel tiled wall you'll find yourself in vintage furniture with grandma-style dishes and cutlery (but it's your stily granny)The girls behind the counter are lovely and make 1st class coffeewalk in hide from the rain and enjoy some cake and watch the world walk by its windows!"
3,"Beautiful ""park"" in the middle of a hectic part of the city. Easy to reach from the Alsterkrug Hotel, where we stayed. Not much traffic we met 5 people on a sunny August Monday afternoon, but be aware of the sometimes speeding cyclists ;-) !! You can walk around the lake and the ""Moor"" easily in an hour, or spent much more if you follow each and every trail. Especially if you observe the cute little houses, with their accurate design and trimmed lawn (this is Germany ;-)  and of course some garden gnomes of the ""Kleingartenverein"" parcels around the Moor."
3,"A great roof-top bar in Hamburg, in the very center of the city. The very top level is open, so absolutely fabulous during the summer. The place is a bit pricey, but it's worth going there for a beer or a cocktail. In the evening, you might need to book a table.I highly recommend this bar, it's absolutely magic!"
4,"Richtig lecker, nette Personal, immer wieder."
4,"Well known to hamburgers, but something of a secret for people from out of town, it's taken me 3 years to get there!Tucked away behind the exhibition halls in Lagerstrasse you go through what appears to be a Culinary Wholesaler, up an industrial staircase and enter a world of meat. Yes it's almost a palace dedicated to the consumption of flesh.Beautifully laid tables and Napiery, serious steak knives, great bread,  four types of salt, a warm greeting, promised that what would was to follow would satisfy deeply.I was just there for the meat and ordered a steak medium rare with some gratin potatoes. Delicious flavoursome meat. A very generous 250grams. I was in heaven. Hear fish is amazing too."
0,"I had a ice coffee and I was very disappointed. It did not taste well. The coffee was like water with a bit of coffee taste. Also I did not feel so well afterwards. Maybe it was bad luck, but there are much nicer places."
3,"Came here last night as we were showing some visiting family the Hafen City area and some great views of the harbour area.I have walked past a few times but not tried it here. So we tried it!All in all, a very nice Thai food experience. Nice and polite service in English and/or German, no fuss when we asked for simple non-spicy food (chicken noodle stir fry) for the children and then on opting for the 3 smaller set tasting menus (one each of A, B & C) for EUR33 got a wonderful mix of truly delicious authentic food.Only downside was the cost, but I guess in this part of town ( yuppie flats, business expense lunches and cruise ship tourists) it is what it is plus the food really is very good here.So for 3 set meals, 2 childrens meals, 5 drinks + service = not much change from EUR200 !!So all in all, very nice for a special family treat (but just not that often)"
4,"I feel like I am in an Abbott & Costello movie when talking about this place... ""Where are you going?"" The Daily, ""No, not when, where"" The Daily! ""Ok so you go daily"" ""yes but it's The Daily""!! It could go on and on. But the most important thing here is the food. Not a big coffee drinker so don't ask me how good the coffee the was. The food on the other hand, that I can tell you about. The food here is pretty good and the prices you can't beat. Each day they have a different ""special"" warm meal. However, they always have a choice of delicious soups, hearty pastas, and warm baked potatoes to please the belly. I always seem to get the daily special which my favorite is the lasagna. It just melts in your mouth. The layers of cheese and sauce, and more cheese and more sauce. Ok now I'm hungry. Anyway, to top it all off they have some tasty muffins and cakes as well. Just be sure to beat the lunch rush because it will be hard to find a place to sit!"
3,"I've now been here three times and can say I think the food is stupidly good for the price (~6€ per meal). I've ordered the palak paneer thali the last two times and would highly recommend this dish (spinach with cheese cubes).This is a pretty small place with authentic Indian food served on metal trays. You order at the counter, get a buzzer, then pickup your food, which is divided into entree, rice, yogurt, side salad, side chickpeas, and naan. Everything is really fresh tasting and delicious, besides the small salad which is really boring (but whatever, ignore it). I could easily recommend this place if you want some authentic Indian food."
2,"Today around lunchtime I was there for the Halloween treats. Sadly the spooky cupcakes weren't ready then. But still the owner made us 5 boxes of the things - after a few special pleads.They didn't get decorated as creatively as we thought and there were only 2 different kinds (banana and raspberry) on offer but we still liked them. Very sweet and colourful things coming in a cute little pink cardboard box. A very girlish affair altogether, I'd say. 5 Euro for a box of 2 of the candy buggers. And man, they tasted very, very sweet as well, phew.Nice stuff but honestly not too breath-taking and just too sweet. And after all the are only pimped muffins ;) But I like this special Halloween event so why not go and find out for yourself. They are open until 23h tonite."
3,"A favorite Döner spot!  But you must know my history with Döner.  First, I cannot pronounce it.  Try as I might, now over a few years and many different coaches, I cannot say the word without sounding like a Northeastern American, which I am not.  Second, I tried Döner in Berlin, some say the capitol of Döner, first in 2006.  Despite all of my American friends enthusiastic and sometimes overkill approach to this food object, I did not like it.  Therefore, I did not try it again until about 2 years ago.  Still, I could not adjust to the taste, especially with such yucky tastes springing up in my tastebud memories.  But finally, I was convinced to try the skewers, and loved them.  I must admit the portions are too big, but now at least I try my best to get through them.Now I live with Döner experts.  They can tell you all the best places here in Hamburg AND Berlin.  They will tell you waiting in line for that one super crazy popular spot in Berlin is, well, not really worth it with all the selection available for Döner.  And I was eating with them at this restaurant.  Öz Review: It is fresh.  The restaurant is clean.  The food is great.  The selection of dishes is traditional, and everyone I have tried is great.  Suggestions: Order dessert, you will be more than pleasantly surprised. Lesson:  Even if you do not like something after a few tries, if friends of yours INSIST that you will love it THIS time, give it a try."
4,a great taste of home with american style breakfast complete with excellent veggie sausage. good pancakes too!
4,"Highly recommended for fish lovers, never had the opportunity to try so many different fishes before"
4,"The place is my personal Vietnamese heaven. Veggie soup is very tasty and filling. A delicate veggie broth, rice noodles, tofu and green vegetables - that is what you get as a vegetarian/vegan pho option for 7 euros. So worth the money! Another vegan option I can suggest is a noodle salad with tofu. It's very flavorful and refreshing, but ask about fish sauce in advance!   Will come back for sure!"
3,"I enjoyed this place immensely. In my walk back to my hotel, I needed to grab a bite for dinner. Found a fun outside table and ordered a glass of wine. Based on previous yelp reviews, I knew better than to order the nachos, but I didn't want to order a full dinner. I opted for the fried Camembert app, which arrived with a nice crisp basic salad. The plate had two discs of Camembert, which I found very generous. It was hot, crunchy and crisp and the berry sauce they came with went perfectly with them.The waitstaff was very friendly: disclaimer, I do speak fluent, native German so that may help a bit. But they were very easy going when I asked to move to get out of the plume of cigarette smokers. Price was reasonable and I left full and happy!!"
4,"If you are into kebabs, then this place is a recommenation. Simply because of the very high turnover - surprising at this location - you can be assured that the food is always fresh. I found the service really fast. Prices are not dramatically on the cheap side, but worth it."
4,"This is the best place Hamburg has to offer.Come here as long as it's not raining too much; enjoy the river, the view, the ships, your beers. Relax about speedy service, this is not why you are here, just be glad you have a chair.And if it's too crowded, just get your basics from the counter and sit on the rocks or the sand.Don't expect any delicacies - some beers or Weinschorle, some fish rolls or so ... all not bad but certainly not great ... and some serious shipping on view. Kids playing in the sand between the tables.This is Hamburg."
4,"This is my local Starbucks, practically across the street from my office. Starbucks...you know it. What should I write? If you like it, great. If not, go find something else. There's plenty of better cafes (in regards to taste of coffee) in Hamburg. At the same time, I get my wLAN here and can work well from the location. Plus it's definately one of the nicer Starbucks when it comes to interior. Don't forget to look up when ordering."
3,having a cup of really good espresso at marsbar also includes usage of their free wifi (wlan). sometimes you meet some b-celebrities like sylvie van der vart or her husband there. maybe because marsbar is close to RTL nord.its nicer in summer because you can sit outside and smoke.
3,"We went there for early dinner on our last night in Germany. The place was packed though the food came out at reasonable time. We ordered medium spicy chicken wings for starter. It was good but very spicy for us so we suggest if you want mild, choose the bbq variety instead. For the main course we had hickory bbq burgers served with fries on the side. The buns were brioche so it's softer than the usual burer buns. For dessert, we had hot fudge sundae which is my favorite. It taste better than it looks! My bf had a beer while I got a .75l of water. Our bill came at around €60. It costs more than our usual budget but we enjoyed the food anyway and it's our last day in our Germany vacation. It is not a quiet restaraunt. And don't expect so much if you want to be seated by the window with a nice view. I am not sure if they accept table booking because the feature on the website was not working when we tried."
4,"Always wanted to meet Audrey Tautou? Me too, that's why I spend all of my free time loitering around this particular photo booth. It's of the type that uses intensely bright flash, bubbling chemicals, and only prints in black and white - yielding a hilarious result which means you'll be laughing by the third shot, and therefore get something you like! Compare this to the lifeless, soulless, trashy photo-me monopoly in the UK, with an annoying computer woman patronising you into looking stupid, and you'll be glad you came to Germany. I never did meet Amelie, but I will."
4,"Wow. Really cool bar. I was well impressed to find the first Tornado table since I've been in Hamburg - good to know I can keep up the skills on this table type. Also, the tables are free, which makes it the first bar ever I've been in with free tables - simply unbelievable! The guys in here appeared to be of an incredibly high standard - will be good to get down here on weekends and check out the craic. One more thing. What is a washing machine doing in a bar? I need a drink, and some table football :-)"
4,"Karls is just awesome! I grew up going loads to ethiopian restaurants and having lots of ethiopian food so when the chance came to go along with a group to have some injera, I was immediately on that train.It is a small family owned and run restaurant that gives you a very cozy and homey feeling. Alex greets you with a smile when you get in and engrosses you with very interesting stories about origins and history of the food all through the meal as he brings dishes. He really cares about where his ingredients come from and its very evident when he speaks about it. On display are lots of spices, coffee, some baskets from Ethiopia and books next to the windows all centering round the theme of Ethiopia. Some of the coffee and teas are even available to buy.  We got a couple of mixed platters which came in the typical style I'm accustomed to. A large circular tray covered with an injera base with meats, vegetables and sauces on top for a couple of people to share together in a communal style of eating. Additional injera was also brought to eat. Everything was absolutely delicious from the bean sauce to the egg, mince etc. We all ate so much that at the end of the meal we had to seat back and relax for a bit before getting up. If that isn't an indicator of a great meal, I don't know what is. As it is both a cafe and ethiopian restaurant, also available are some cakes; the cheese cake looked good but I was just too full to try any and other treats you'd find at a cafe available.As we were in on a Friday night, we also got to experience the coffee making ceremony which they do only on Friday and Saturday nights so I'd recommend making a reservation and coming on those days if you would like to see it. The coffee beans are roasted as per the ceremony and coffee made for you to drink post-meal using the beans."
1,"Tiefenthal is a cafe/bar/restaurant. Unlike the places at Schanze, this one is really ""higher"" class. It's crowded and unfortunately pretty expensive (but hey, you are in Hamburg - so it's not like you are already not used to it). We didn't go for food, just drinks and the cocktails were pretty good. The Tiefenthal is one of those places you can take your parents for a drink, or yuppie-kinda people (no offense). But if there would be alternatives in Eppendorf, I'd rather go there. As far as I can tell, there are none though."
4,"Ooooohhh how I love this place!! Great decor inside with a very cruisy and relaxing atmosphere. The coffee is good, but not brilliant, however they have the best ever toasted cheese and tomato sandwiches!!! The Gloria burger is also a winner. Food is cheap as chips and quite substantial servingsso go on an empty stomach! The beer selection is great and the staff are attentative and really friendly. On a cold winter sunday, I could stay at Gloria all day..."
2,"(my visit was in October 2015)I found Schmilinsky Weinbistro on Yelp. It's a small restaurant tucked into the basement of a hotel.The service is nice. There's one server to cover all of the tables, but with a limited number of tables, the workload is manageable. My server was really nice and helped translate the menu to English for me.After placing my order, I waited a painfully long time for my food. From the time I sat down to the time my food came, 60 minutes had elapsed. Painful!The food was good, though I found some bones in my fish. The person who prepped the fish should be more careful. But yum, that crispy skin was good.Lentils under the fish were a little salty (like a lot of food in Germany), but good. The mashed potatoes were good, but some chunks were too big.I had a glass of house wine that was also good, but I admit that I'm no connoisseur.I liked the feel, the food was good, and I want to support small businesses, but they have to fix the wait time issue."
2,"The place is dark like Ali Baba's cave. You wait minimum 15-20 min. for such simple meal as crouques. Quality of sandwiches is ok, but nothing special."
4,"Spent a whole evening here recently, and a great time was had by all. Free table football - big bonus. The idea of this place is it's set out like a three room flat. Walk through the front door into the kitchen/utility room. In the back there is a living room, then further back still is the bedroom (also where you'll find the table football table, oddly. Update: We went to 3 Zimmer Wohnung again last night and I accidently found out that theyve massively expanded! Basically I was looking for the toilet (having never been to them here before) and took a wrong turn in the maze downstairs which landed me in the table-football room. After talking to the barman it seems that they only opened the room up a few weeks ago. So the upstairs is the same 3 Room Flat that we've always known, but downstairs there is a new long room with a few sofas, a second bar and 6 table-football tables. Yes, 6. It's quite a cool game, but it's depressing how good all the locals are at it..."
3,"I like that sushi/japanese place.i live just around the corner now! Since they dont have a wide choice of 'sushi menus' (a pre-selected variety of sushi/maki/sashimi), it would be wise here to order one huge dish for everyone. Whenever i am there with my friends, we try to pick a bit from everything and share the entire plate, or else each one of us would be stuck with a 6 piece roll of the same kind of sushi. And their salads are really good, i specially love the sauce! I havent tried the soup, but i have been told it is also good! I am not a saki expert, but when i had it, i liked it!i liked it even more when i got drunk.We had once ordered 2 sakis (as we were 2 persons there) and the waitress got us two 'kettles' of saki, instead of two glasses. That was A LOT for me! but i enjoyed it :) I will definitely be back there soon..."
2,"This was a tough star rating, because there are definitely things I really enjoy about CIU but things I am so so indifferent to as well. I wanted to give it more a 3.5 star rating but (don't laugh!) I can not figure out yet how to scroll to a half star.  Maybe it is something special for ""professional Yelper"" to access, but right now I am earning my wings by rating my favorite things :)Ok, so what do I like about CIU? The atmosphere, the pretty looking bar arrangement, the music, and coming with a friend or friends in a group for cocktails to get yourself prepared to go clubbing/dancing somewhere later if you come on the weekend. If you come during the week, its nice to grab a high table behind the bar, order some world class drinks with fruits hanging all over the place that practically overwhelm the glass itself, and enjoy music with a friend and feel like you kinda went out, but without really doing it up too crazy. What is just okay about the place? Location, it is a bit of a walk unless you are driving by car or dropped off by taxi.  If you are wearing flat shoes, it is no problem at all, but if you are wearing heels and getting off at Jungfernstieg, then its a bit of a ""spazieren gehen"" lovely scenic walk as they might say in Germany.  At least you can walk up Ballindamm next to the lake, I mean the Alster just makes everything THAT much BETTER :)  The food is also just ""okay"" and they stop serving kinda early, considering most people like to drink and eat a bit later here, since it is busier between 7pm and 10pm, so if you try to come late to beat the cocktail rush, you also miss the opportunity to eat.The menu mainly consists of pizzas, salads, pastas and some general appetizers. The drinks really is the real reason most people come here and the music as they have a live DJ that spins good tracks.  For girls and even guys who are not shy to drink a cocktail with an elaborate fruit arrangement sprouting out of the glass, their specialty drinks here are nice to try and taste like an alcoholic dessert more or less. I sometimes am in the mood to enjoy a good martini, but I tried to order it here once and I was not crazy about it.  Martinis are not made equally in Europe vs. the US.  And funnily enough, James Bond was in international man of mystery who loved Martinis, so I wonder where he ordered his????"
4,"a beautiful place with the planetarium, lake, dog play ground, fountain, BBQ.."
4,"Excellent food and service! They were very nice and polite, it was an amazing experience. And the price is completely affordable. Excellent option for breakfast!"
4,"One of the coolest bars i have ever been to in my life. 3 room flat, is a 1970's house party. Well, on the surface. beneth lies a secret german fight club, i mean table football club...its kind of sureal. the beer is cheap, and the selection is plentiful. the sofas are comfy, and the people are nice. But piece of advice, the toliets are alittle unclear as to which is guys and girls...not that anyone minded...germany is a very liberal place"
2,I had expected a little more after reading about this place. The cookie was tiny and the cappuccino a little weak and not really hot (I am a little bit picky though when it comes to coffee) still a better place to have a coffee in hamburg ;)
1,"The service is friendly but extremely slow. Waited 40min for an order that arrived incomplete. The quality is ok, but the food is overpriced. If you have time, patience and no other choice go for it, otherwise I would skip."
4,"You know, I really didn't know that Hamburg is a Hamburger place so when we randomly googled and found this out, I knew I had to find a solid burger to enjoy while I was here! A quick yelp search brings up this place which was close to my hostel in Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and boy did the yelpers NOT disappoint! Unfortunately the infamous Lumper Jack wasn't on the menu but there's a ton of other options available. We came around 17:00 and it was empty--we almost hesitated going in but in the end, we were tired, hungry, and put all our trust in good reviews.My friend initially really wanted NOT a burger so if you're going for something besides a burger, they have like chicken fingers, a salad (yes, just one) and fish and chips. Also, if you're a vegetarian, there's a bunch of solid options on that end too. I couldn't decide from the loads of options, everything sounded amazing but in the end, I splurged for the Truffle Burger (7,90€)  and added an extra side of bacon (+1€). I also made it a meal by adding fries and a drink (3,90€ - choice of bottled beverages from waters to sodas to juices/lemonades to beer). My friend ended up getting the jalapeno burger (6,90€ i think?) with the meal as well.Our food came out pretty quickly and it was HUGE and honestly looked so delicious I barely got the plate and already started stuffing my face. I didn't even realize that they forgot the bacon at first until my friend realized they forgot to add it to hers too so we mentioned it and the chefs added it to the burgers. Holy moly, this burger is banging. The brioche bun has almost a pretzel-y flavor, almost smokey or whatever it is that makes pretzels get that rich brown colour. The burger was cooked a perfect medium (though I usually go for rare) and it was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The fillings were fresh, though the truffle flavor wasn't super present--the bacon really added another dimension of smokiness and honestly it was so good I had a hard time putting it down. The fries were really good too! Crispy but tons of solid potato flavor. When we paid, they asked if we wanted ketchup or mayonnaise but I wasn't sure if it was extra and decided against it. The fries honestly didn't need any sauce but if you want something additional, they do have choluha (reg, green, chipotle) and oil/vinegar. The beer was also very refreshing, and produced in hamburg which was pretty nice!The place is a order @ the counter, buzzer, seat yourself kind of place and is super clean with really nice bathrooms. The staff was really friendly and honestly, this place really was a winner! I don't know what people are talking about in terms of sports bar (?) but it just felt like a nice casual burger place. Definitely recommend!! So good and so glad I stopped in :)"
4,"bok is an asian self-service restaurant close to Altona train station. The prices are fair, the food is average, but very edible. The dishes are quite big, and in contrary to other chinese food places the amount of glutamate is a decent one. The quality suffered a bit in the last months, but it's still tasty there, so walk in, order a kimchi soup and duck with peanut sauce, and then just enjoy. =)"
2,"The massive Hofbräuhaus on Esplanade seem to aim towards a traditional Bavarian experience. The entire eatery looks to be extremely traditional in terms of interior design and service, the menu selection is mainly Bavarian (with a few other European dishes thrown in for good measure). We were a group of about 10 at lunchtime and had no trouble getting a large table. Service was prompt and the food arrived quickly. The food was satisfying and affordable (some of us had a large schnitzel with fries for 5eu). Very nice, traditional, home-style cooking and all-around a good comfortable place to have lunch in groups of all sizes. Highly recommended! EDIT:It looks like I'm going to have to bring the rating down for this place. During our last visit, service was non-existent despite the restaurant being relatively empty, and the waiter refused to serve me tap water. Refusing to serve tap water is actually against German law, and in general a big no-no - shame on you, Hofbräuhaus."
4,I didn't try the sweet goodies; instead I had a pasta. Pretty delicious at a very cheap price.
1,"I walked past this place a number of times, I've never been bothered to go in but always had an inconscious desire of having a meal here. Maybe what my inconscious was trying to tell me wasn't something like you should try it but, at the contrary, something like leave it. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this place, for two simple reasons: food isn't particularly tasty and it's a bit too expensive (but probably not for the area). Don't really remember much about service or decorations, but honestly who cares if the food isn't good. So the recommendation would be to eat here only if you are really really, really hungry. Too hungry even for a 30 seconds walk to Grindelalle, were you can find something better and cheaper for sure."
3,Always busy at lunch time and sometimes a bit to crowded. Although the food really tastes good... Love the pickled garlic chilis for seasoning. Unfortunately it sometimes takes a bit to get served and some of the serving staff is grumpy.
3,"Came here to Hamburg to visit the sites but it was raining and a bit cold so we decided get some lunch and stay out of the rain.  We took a taxi to the  place and it was fully packed when we arrived around noon with no available seats so we decided to go walk around the shopping district and come back later.  We came back about 45 mins later and there was a couple empty tables so we decided to order.  I decided to get the lunch special for €10 which included a burger, fries and with a drink or milkshake.  My burger came out hot and juicy with lettuce, tomato and cheese with BBQ sauce and mayo all on a brioche bun.  There was Hellman's mayo and ketchup along with Cholula hot sauce on the table.   My fries were very hot and crisp so I know they just came out the fryer.  I decided on a bottle of Coca Cola rather than the milkshake.  My lunch was excellent in all.  I thoroughly enjoyed my burger.  Maybe the only thing missing would be some grilled onions and pickles.  This restaurant has no parking area along with most places here.  The place is in a modern building and close to a shopping district.   At least I can now say I had a Hamburg in Hamburg.  Yea I'm corny like that."
4,"Nice café just near the Elbphilharmonie. It looks like an old parisian bookstore with its wooden furniture. Really cool style. The other rooms are more commun, I would recommend (if possible) to go to the one which has its door just in front of the Elbphilharmonie."
3,Excellent fresh food and impeccable service. Great place for a date. Gnocchi melted in my mouth and small salad looked and tasted great.
4,"Finaly we decided to drop by this tiny restaurant which we are passing almost every day while we cycle to our work. I must say all the time I had bad opinion about this restaurant, judging by outside look, but once we entered in I immediately recognized that I was wrong. It had pleasant atmosphere with nice smells and welcoming staff (I guess owners). From first view on menu I could feel that here they have good food. I ordered pasta pesto while my wife had some type of fruit soup. It was really delicious and my pasta was even better than in Vapiano, for which I was thinking is far Nr. 1 in Hamburg. I can only say that Sagners is coming on our short list of local restaurant where we are going for lunch breaks."
4,"This place saved our lives after a train from Denmark arrived an hour ahead of schedule. Super friendly staff even at 6 in the morning. Wonderful sandwiches and amazing sweet potato soup with a ginger twist. Oh, and did I mention? Incredibly cheap, 10/10 would come again!"
4,"When I first visited HafenBahnhof I was living in St Pauli and quite new to Hamburg - it felt like a very long trip to get there and back. I haven't been back in a long time, but with my now much-more-substantial knowledge of Hamburg, it doesn't feel so far away - especially if you happen to live in Altona or own a bike (cycling around Hamburg is easy). The bar itself is sort of like a big shed (see the photos). They have a small stage at one end for bands, which is actually the only reason that I've ever visited!"
4,"lovely and beautifully decorated place. very good coffee and delicious scones. the whole place gives a very personal feel, and it's a pleasure to spend time there. definitely coming again for more scones!"
4,"I've been here multiple times over a few years, and never fail to be impressed.  Most recently for lunch, the efficiency, quality, and charm - - at an incredible price - - is something just jaw-dropping.  Nice thin crust, ingredients with abandon and flair,  remarkable service, fun vibe - - Luigi's continues to blow me away.  The experience can vary depending on whether you get there when it is packed (which it generally is) or you can breeze in and get a table (worth timing your visit to make this a possibility).   But no matter what, and no matter when, you will have some super tasty pizza, and a vivid experience."
3,"I was visiting the Miniature Wonderland and looked up restaurants that accept credit cards because a lot of the dining options around there only accept cash. I didn't convert my money as I was stopping in there for only a day. Figured you can use your card to pay at most dining establishments. Well, apparently not in Hamburg. When I tried to pay for my delicious crepe with a warm pear, I was told it was cash only. I offered to leave my card with them while I hunted down an ATM, but the obviously bothered waiter ran downstairs to get a POS machine and accepted my MasterCard. I tried to add a tip but was told they cannot add it to the card sale even though the print out indicated that option. Food and coffee were both amazing and they even offered me an English menu. I recommend this locale but be ready with local currency."
4,"It's no secret that I'm in love with Lena. However, even if that were not true, I would still give Karlsons five whole Qype stars, as it's truly fantastic. I love the light, airy feel of the place, reminding me somewhat of cafes and bars just north of here, in Copenhagen. Down to business. There's a buffet for sandwiches and salads, but hot food is served at the table. The highlights today were Swedish meatballs, a delicious fish soup, and Danish hot dogs. These dishes proved so popular certain team members even had 2 dinners! (no names mentioned David) Moving on to dessert, and we were delighted to find out Lena had bee up since 4am baking, and the fruits of the oven were indeed mouthwatering - particularly the carrot cake. It's a shame I'm leaving Hamburg today, otherwise I suppose I would have deserted the Milchbar for my new belle Karlsons..."
3,I think they have great coffee and a good selection of bagels and cakes. Sometimes the bagels don't look that fresh though. The cakes are all very good! You order and pay at the counter and then wait for your order and take it to the table yourself. If they aren't that busy the girls will do that too sometimes. But usually they have a lot to do. They do to-go as well. The Café itself looks a bit rough around the edges. But it's comfy and if you get a window seat it's great to sit and watch the passers by. The back is a bit dark. When it's nice weather you can sit outside too.
4,"Great place, service is super just like the food. We had a soup (linsensuppe) and a burito ( falafel with sheep's cheese) that both tasted great. Service is very friendly and attentive, definitely recommended to visit when in Hamburg!"
4,"It's refreshing to see a kebab shop that is always packed full of people! This bustling little place is the closest I've seen to a kebab place merging with a bar. The staff are really funny, and always seem to make up a randomly lower price than the menu. When you ask for beers they fill up a carrier bag with load without enquiring as to how many you wanted! I love it. Food wise there's a massive selection of healthy stuff, including a lot of roasted veg, humous, rice, unleven bread etc. You won't get bored... ... and the killer factor? It's at the end of my road. Mr. Kebab  Dubara. Fact.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=D7Nx…"
3,"Had a day in Hamburg and a friend brought us here.  Did not like it that I had to give up my bottled water at the door... did they think I'l not order a drink and just sip my water in there?! Once in, the place was great. Feel like I was on a sandy beach bar somewhere else in the world.   Then the rain come down like crazy & everyone squeezed into the covered bar area...dancing to the music.  So much fun, very memorable!  Highly recommend it !"
3,"Nice coffee shop if you are walking in this area in the mornings.  I must admit, a stopped in here a couple times from being out all night before and would grab a coffee to freshen my mind on the way to University, haha!  Yes, sometimes we would drink during the week and I would pull an all nighter around Grindelallee and would jump onto the U3 to go home and shower then head to University for classes.  Anyways, this coffee shop is next to the U3 exit/entrance depending which direction you are headed and I quite like their coffee to go, friendly service and assortment of pasties ranging from light flakey croissants to more sweet treats like something similar of a cheese Danish.  Croissants are delicious on a universal scale of consistency, you know what to expect, light, buttery, flakey, soft, fluffy and basically delicious calories.  However, sometimes I find cheesecakes or any cream cheese pastry in Europe not quite as sweet as in the US, probably because we really go HEAVY on the sugar, but their pastries here were the perfect mixture of sweetness :)The prices are fair and its additionally a nice Cafe to sit in the mornings with a paper.  It is also nice for a cake, they have lots of cakes here and all tasting very fresh, Mmmmm. Once I had something like a pumpkin/carrot cake with the creamiest frosting that I put in a to go bag but ended up eating it before I even made it to the UBahn entrance which is literally 1min walk outside the door, haha.... I really love Scandinavian themed coffee shops or bistros, when I first moved to Hamburg, I frequented many of these shops around the city."
4,The most beautiful building of old classic architecture in Hamburg. The Rathaus building was once described to me that it is so impressive because it is reflecting the self confidence of the Hamburgers and their love for the city. It think that is a pretty good description. :)
2,"This is one of my favorite cafes around the area where I live. Coffee is decent (I generally have the soja cappucino) but their food is the real deal. Great to have a small bite or for brunching during rainy days. I recommend their soups and their vegetarian quiche. Additionally they have free wifi, making it a great alternative to Starbucks if you need a place to read or work. If you are in the area, check it out!Mucho love,D."
3,"Yes I like this place! It has a great atmosphere and a cosy feeling, and they have some real funny things! For example a link on a post it in the toilet on how to use a paper towel in the right way. Just a funny detail, and I like such things.The coffee is good but a bit expensive. The Chai Latte not sweet enough for my taste.I had a bagel with tomato, avocado and cheese and that was good. The food some other people at my table had also looked really tasty. The staff was very friendly and worked quick. I always love it when a place has a living room feel! It makes you stay very long and you feel at home! We've been sitting there for a few hours waiting for an audition, and for those moments these places are the best!"
2,"Went for the all you can eat wings fro 13.99 euros. It was alright, they have about 14 different flavors. The beers were nice, a large 500ml would be about 4.20 euros which is better than other restaurants. The waitress spoke English so I guess foreigner friendly."
4,"Great Chinese food all round. As already mentioned by the other reviewers, the DimSum are excellent and the best in town. The Duck Rice is also very good. All in all I would say that this place wins it by a mile on the Chinese Food front. It's like many of the places in Asia, the decor is a little tacky, but the food is great. This place is essentially like a short trip to Asia and back!"
4,"Ah, vegetarian friends. Who'd have them? Not me for one! But on occasion I do have few visiting couchsurfers with an aversion to meat. For these moments, Azietona is a little gem, which is fortuitously located next to sofabar!"
0,"OrderedAManhattan-Saturday night, trendy spot, was not very full. Service was quick and nice, but the Manhattan didn't taste like a Manhattan. Tasted more like cough syrup. My boyfriend a Cuba Libre. Also didn't taste like a Cuba Libre. We finished the drinks and quickly set off to find a better bar."
4,"A nice place with friendly stuff , and the food is AMAZING !! Highly recommend this place !"
3,"Such a cool find thanks to my awesome hubby who planned a surprise date here :)Free jazz Mondays (the band was great!), fairly priced drinks, chill crowd all inside an old fire boat-it was a lovely night indeed. I highly recommend checking out Das Fueurschiff!"
3,"The best thing about this place is that it's quiet later in the evening, which is when my boyfriend and I usually go there. It's also on the cheap side. The dishes we've tried so far taste very good. No idea if they are traditional Thai/whatever dishes, but we don't care about that as long as they taste good."
3,"This was one of the nicest, most relaxed, dark and dingy bars I found in Hamburg, I was in the city for a week on my own and was comfortable to read my book in here and have a couple of beers or white wines without feeling conspicious. The staff were friendly, the DJ was relaxed and varied, there's even thai snacks brought round to your table. One of the least pretentious bars in the area."
4,"This place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Probably the best tourist attraction i have seen so far! I was really surprised at how much i enjoyed my time here. I went in thinking I would spend one hour at most in this place and three hours later i could not get enough of this miniature wonderland. They have really thought of everything when creating the little moniture wonderland. The amount of detail that was put into this world is absolutely astounashing! As soon as you walk in they have the exhibit of a town in germany and they take you through the history of the town through various years. As you walk through they have a display of Switzerland, Hamburg, The airport, USA, Scandanvia and Bavaria (there might be one or two that i am missing maybe?) Italy was under construction. My absolute favorite was Switzerland, it was huge and it extended a bit on the third floor. Make sure you spend enough time in each country for the day-night transition because that blew my mind. The way the lights flickered and the train lights came one at a time was very life-like. They even had little miniature people inside the trains and cars as they went by. You will experience everything in this place, from a miniature concert experience to even little disasters (I don't want to spoil anything). This place is a must-see attraction. If you are in hamburg you have to go! Best 12euros I have ever spend!"
4,"Probably the most comfy bar in the Sternschanze area. It is crammed with couches, a smoking area is in the basement.ZIII has an adequate amount of drinks on the menu, but no food. That shouldn't be a problem, the Sternschanze is bustling with places to eat.Prices are average and below, drinks are always great.The barmaids seem to be chosen by their great looks and their permanent good mood.English is spoken."
4,Must see place in Hamburg! I have been here many years ago when I was little and I loved it and now grow up I saw how even more amazing this is. They are making more and more new exibitions and you dont need to be child to enjoy the plesure of this place ;)
4,"Great atmosphere, raw and minimalist deco, cheap original and fresh delicious cocktails (yep, all of it), awesome music, chill people...what would you want more for a Friday night?"
1,"Update: I'm going to have to mark Jim Burritos down a bit because they keep on disappointing. The food is generally still pretty good, although my last burrito was burnt from being left in the toaster far too long. I feel bad saying bad things about the place, but I think one member of staff in particular is rather dozy. She seems to have no idea who ordered what first. If she's on, you can walk in and order your food and then watch as streams of people who came in much later get their food first. Then when your food finally arrives (I have waited 90 minutes) you could very well be given the wrong order. I took two friends last week. We were the only people without food when we ordered, so I expected the three burritos to come quite fast, say in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, after watching plenty of other tables receive their food, we finally got ours. Mine was burnt. My friend was given a spicy one, when she'd ordered non-spicy. After a small complaint she was offered some extra sour cream. Instead of bringing it over, the staff went outside for a cigarette break. The sour cream never came and when we went to pay they had the nerve to overcharge us! Sigh. I still like Jim Burritos, and will continue to go, but I won't take visitors anymore, and I certainly will never go back on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday - they are just too slow.Old review: Pretty damn good burrito shop where the old Hatari cantina used to reside. We popped into Jim Burrito's last night - you've gotta try the new places, right? I got a beef burrito with guacamole for EUR6.50 (EUR5.50 without the guacamole). Their burritos come wrapped in tin foil, and so can be a bit of a pain to eat - I'd rather be given the option to have it straight onto a plate without all the foil. Anyway, the burrito was great."
3,"This is a newly opened Indian restaurant in the Hallerstrasse. It's nicely decorated and the staff is very attentive. They also have a large selection of vegetarian dishes at good prices. My Tarka Dal was delicious and at a reasonable price. Only the service was not particularly fast, so make sure you have some time when you visit."
4,"This place is so good! It's also rather popular. Ignore the queue of people waiting in the doorway and make straight for a waiter. They'll furnish you with some beers whilst you inevitably have to wait a while for a table. I went here on a Tuesday night and we drank 2 beers during the wait, so... it's busy. If you can get over this the food is served quite quickly, and the meat here is so good, it's worth it. Delicious lamb kebabs, cutlets, and minced skewers, served with great chips or rice, and zatziki. It's basic greek, but authentic, and delicious. And they show the football. I'll deinitely be coming back!"
4,"Toller Cocktailladen mit sehr nettem Service. Wir kommen immer gerne her, weil die Cocktails lecker sind, man gut beraten wird, die Musik meistens gut ist und eigentlich alles zusammen passt."
3,"This is a nice restaurant/bar in Barmbek. As far as I know it's the only nice one ;)Very close to the Museum der Arbeit (Museum of Work), so you can get some culture before the booze and the food. Which, by the way, is quite good here. But also quite expensive. Nevertheless the place is always crowded in the evening, so make sure you come early.Biggest downside: If you're sitting outside the noise of the airplanes is really annoying."
3,"great food for a reasonable price, also pretty handy as it is situated next to the university."
0,"As a Pakistani, I was very disappointed with the dining experience here. Maybe I'm used to more traditional Pakistani food (from Karachi), but I was open and curious to trying Balochi style dishes. We ordered samosas, chicken tikka masala and karaih lamb. There was a stone or something very hard, possible a bone piece, in one of the samosas (vegetarian). We told the server and he said sorry, but nothing beyond that. It was hard enough to shatter a tooth if bitten on aggressively. Next, the main dishes were very mediocre - not very tasty, but most of all the portion size was ridiculously small. I was astonished at how little was provided in each dish. There wasn't enough for even one person, and each dish was 14 Euro. Not to mention that one order of samosas only had one actual samosa in it. I've never seen that at any desi restaurant ever. After ordering those 3 dishes and paying 45 euro we were still hungry. As if we didn't even eat. So we cut our losses and left to eat somewhere else. I would not recommend this restaurant. I just moved to the Hamburg area and still am in search of THE Pakistani restaurant I will go to when I'm craving my mom's food. This one failed horribly."
4,"My wife and I came to this place because of the words of her friends. We had been going to another burger place in town and wanted to see how this one stacked up. We walked in and we're greeted by one of the owners. He sat us and was extremely pleasant. My wife speaks German but I don't. We sat and one of the owners took our order. The owners both spoke English which made ordering easier for me. The menu is in German, but they do a great job of explaining what is on it. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for our food to come, out come the masterpieces. We bit into them and we're immediately taken by how juicy and tasty they were. The burgers and fries were absolutely perfect !!! The toppings were fantastic, and fresh. Everything was perfect when it came to the food. As for the service, it was also top notch. The owners came around and made sure that everyone was ok and were eager to assist with any request. They went above and beyond what I would expect and am accustomed to. They make sure to take care of their customers. I intended to get their names to add to this review, but I forgot. However, I will be updating because we have found our new burger place in Hamburg. We will be returning customers. Pros : 1. The burgers are fantastic. The meat is tasty and juicy but not oily and greasy. They were cooked to perfection. 2. The fries were also cooked to perfection. Not too greasy. They were prepared just right. 3. They make these awesome cookies and cream milkshakes. They are not too heavy and taste great. And this is coming from someone who doesn't usually drink milkshakes. But these were very very very good. 4. As good as the burgers and everything else was, the service was equally as good if not better. They really take care of their customers. Being from NYC, that is something that doesn't always happen. To see such attention to that service was a pleasant surprise. Cons : (Still trying to think of one). All in all, I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I recommend anyone to check this place out. It's definitely well worth it."
4,"I'm the fans of this restaurant as I was living around the corner of the it. I haven't been here for a long time after I moved out this district. I was here again for their Tuesday 3 courses Menu which costs €19,90. You can pick up either fish or meat on the main course. I was very very happy and satisfied as their cooking was no change at all, still keeping their high standard. I'm sure I will come again and it's highly recommended."
1,"Meh. If you're single and looking to mingle on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, Sausalitos might be a good place to start. Their drink menu is pretty impressive, but I found the Mexican food subpar. Not worth the money, in my opinion. On the weekends it feels much more like a club than a restaurant. I'd go again with friends for drinks, but I won't be paying for a meal again."
4,"Nice little spot in a beautiful old Hamburg neighborhood. Part ""Cheers,"" part New York neighborhood bistro. German staples and a few goodies like eggs and potatoes.They don't open until Noon (2p on Sunday). Perfect for brunching after a night on the Reeperbahn!FYI, they are very protective of their larger tables when it's busy. If you are one or two, they won't seat you at a four-top. Yours truly is traveling solo this trip and got relegated to the tiny bar. No complaints, as that's my preference rather than being the lonely dude at a big table.  Also a good perch for people watching and composing pithy prose."
4,"Staff was friendly, explained all the items, and was a lot of fun to talk to. Everything we we tried was very good. Good music for the vibe too"
4,"AMAZING!!!pros:veganaffordableamazing servicewonderful atmospherecons:noneI ordered the Barbecue burger and I actually ended up ordering a second one because it was so deliciousit had a wonderful ""cream"" like sauce as well as a tons of barbecue sauce that was super duper yummy!!the pizza was melty, had a wonderful sauce & it really had fresh ingredients + toppings!! I can't wait to come back to Hamburg and come again!"
3,"Excellent kebab house with innovative queuing system. You queue, order, pay and take a ticket - then find a seat and your food arrives in about 3 mins! I recommend the mix teller - wholesome plate of lots of stuff. I always get this as the menu choices are baffling. The battered fish looks interested but I've never had it thus far. Friendly staff and bargin basement prices. Worth a go."
4,"Loved absolutely everything about this place! It's so romantic and cosy, great friendly service, perfect atmosphere and delicious food, desserts and coffee!"
3,"Gotta have a hamburger in Hamburg! We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar without a reservation and the place was absolutely packed the whole time. Heed the warning in the menu: this burger truly takes its damn time. We waited almost AN HOUR to receive food after ordering. Strangely, other people sitting at the bar got their food at the same time even though they arrived 30 minutes after us. That's the only reason the Bird doesn't get 5 stars. However, the servers were nice and the beers are big and they serve decent cider as well, so that took up our time. When we actually got the burger, I was ravenous. I'm happy to say that it was delicious and juicy and the HUGE medium rare patty was more like rare; very pink inside! I was in meaty bliss for the next 20 minutes. I opted for the Ghetto Deluxe with an egg and was about to order fries as well but our server kindly stopped me, bringing my attention to the fact that each burger comes with fries. And it is a lot of fries! They are crispy outside and creamy inside. And I was skeptical about using an english muffin for a bun but it worked out very well; keeping the burger structurally intact while soaking up all the yolk and meatjuice in the nooks and crannies. Also appreciated is the fact that they put the condiments right in front of you, and they have Tapatio! I don't like it when restaurants give me a tiny container of ketchup with my food.. I know it is a stereotype that Americans love ketchup but I'm afraid I have to propagate it; give me my damn ketchup. This is an excellent burger; one of the better ones that I've had the pleasure of eating in my lifetime. However, be prepared for a LONG wait and don't forget to bring cash."
0,"Went here as it was the closest to the hotel. Very disappointed. Got a steak that had the texture of being boiled, and wuite chewy. No effort from staff to correct or even take it of the bill although I hardöy had a bite from it. Will not be coming back. Ever."
4,"I went there for breakfast and ordered a cappuccino and Hummus Bowl (Lime hummus, beetroot hummus, edible wildherb salad, beluga lentils, organic pached egg, sesame, pumpkin seeds, sunflowerseed & sourdough bread). The coffee was great and the food was simple and tasty (it was more tasty than I expected).They have outside tables and an upper floor. There are some tables next to the windows with a view over a canal. Nice interior overall. The waitress was nice too.It was a peaceful slow morning in this nice café. I will be back."
1,"Disappointment! I have tried their cheesecake before, they are really rich and creamy! But today I decided to try their lunch. Since they went vegan, something has happened to this place. They portions of their cheesecakes have been reduced, and the food options have been limited. The menu says that they offer the best vegan burger in town,  (Honestly, I really really hate to give bad reviews) unfortunately it was really dry and lacked taste. The ""fries"" were also soggy,  so maybe it could be great if instead they could do a salad. Maybe it was a bad day. :)"
3,"This is sort of place I would come to a lot if I wasn't married with two children and had a highly stressful job that took up all of my time. Or in my 40s. So, the format is like being in your coolest friends apartment, complete with sofas, pool table, cracking tunes, and an open basement with dancefloor and various industrial remnants of it's time as a DildoFabrik (yes it's an easy translation) . It's also one street from the main Reeperbahn, not hugely far from St Pauli / Millerntor / all the fun of the fair. So perfectly located for good times and a friendly bohemian crowd. Very popular with the Qype Kids, and the venue for our excellent 2011 Xmas (Q)iez party."
3,"One of the only restaurants with terrace overlooking the Elbe and the beach in one of the nicest and oldest areas of Hamburg where the old Captains' and fishermen's houses are lining a pedestrian street. The only thing missing are cobblestones. Only the walk along Oevelgoenne is worth it: the abundance of flowers, the meticulously maintained houses and the views of the Elbe and the sunlovers on the beach make you distinctly feel on holiday. The restaurant is primarily axed on fish and shellfish with soups based on lobster, shrimp cocktail and classic fish preparations as main course. Some innovative touches like dried flower petals in the soup). Nice place to linger, but it is also a popular place, so you cannot linger too long.."
2,"Due to some stellar (German) Qype reviews I was eager to visit Speisekammer this saturday - and left somewhat disappointed. Food is decent, but priced a bit too ambitiously for what one gets. My Caesar Salad, for example, was perfectly edible, but yet another German variation of the theme instead of a ""proper"" Caesar. My friend's breakfasts weren't exactly spectacular, what with a rather bland assortment of cheeses and not very appetising food garnish. All this means Speisekammer doesn't exactly end up on my ""avoid"" list, but given disproportionality of prices and the quality of food on offer I feel no urge to go there again in the future."
1,"I'm sure this is a nice place to grab a coffee or sandwich - at least it looks nice - but for me, it was one great disappointment.- The people working pretented to not understand a single word of my English and if they did, they answered in German. They also didn't look at me when talking to me and I basically didn't feel welcome at all.- The breakfast plate I had been so extremely looking forward to ever since I saw the photos both here on Yelp and on Instagram wasn't mentioned on the menu, and when I asked for it I was told that that's only for special occassions or special people (!).+ The caffè latte and little yoghurt bowl with granola I ended up with tasted very good.So Hej papa deserves more than one star because of the food, the location and the cute name ;), but I would never ever go there again. Although, if they'd offer me that breakfast plate.........."
3,"Cooko is offering a Great vararity of Vietnamese and Asian dishes. Thus everyone should find something on the menu. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the dishes are freshly & fast prepared."
4,"I walked the streets for over an hour finding this place and working up my appetite. Upon entering, I saw a bustling, too busy for words or greetings staff doing what needed to be done to satisfy the already packed house.But then... appeared in the doorway between the bar and the first small dining room, a middle aged man with herring bone rimmed glasses and a chef's stature, looking like he belonged. Our eyes met and I moved slowly closer to him to question if they were still serving. (fear set in that it was after nine on a Saturday night with a packed house they would tell me they are out of food). The gentleman introduced himself as Sven, the owner and chef and pointed to a small table they obviously squeezed in for single diners like myself.A woman server quickly set the table, seated me and handed me tonight's menu. Hand written (by Sven himself) in German, I struggled to grasp just one dish to be recognizable. NOT! When the server returned, I asked her what alphabet this menu was written in? She said the chef writes the menu every night in his own handwriting, and she proceeded to read and translate in English the offerings of the night. All sounded incredibly creative and amazing, so my reply was, ""what is everyone raving about tonight?"" She suggested the Pepper Steak on a bed of Navy, Lima and Green beans. And the Swordfish Carpaccio. I asked her to wine pair the best of what was 'by the glass' and that she did. An Italian Rosé with the Carpaccio and a Portuguese Cabernet Sauvignon with the Steak.A whole lot more action and another glass of wine occurred and wow, oh wow what an amazing culinary and night on the town with Sven unfolded. I could go on and on here... it was my last night in Hamburg which is why I opted to dine in the best I could find. Well it turned out to be Sven's last night as he was 'moving on' (not retiring) but just done with this chapter of his life. Upon finishing my main course, Sven politely joined me at my table and told me his story of how he started the restaurant 33 year's ago. He pulled a delightful older man close to him and began kissing his bald head and telling me how much he loved this man. The man had been with the restaurant for 28 years as the kitchen coordinator/dishwasher/busboy and all 'round go-to man behind the scenes. It was obviously an emotional moment for both these guys.Sven gestured to the bartender to pour me another glass of wine (on the house) and continued his story about how the German government offers a €100,000 tax deduction if you've started a business and sell it at age 55. Sven proceeded to invite me out on the town with him for a few more drinks in the St. George district where he knew all the local pubs and lots and lots of people. He even walked me to the train station to make sure I got on the right train back to my hotel.Anyway... so much more to this story...Bottom line... I'm sure the quality of food coming out of this kitchen will sustain because the staff obviously loved Sven and were sad to see him go. The understudies in the kitchen are apparently who bought the restaurant and planned on changing nothing.I hope I run into Sven again someday... maybe in Portugal or the Azores!"
4,"Excellent little quiet bar, great beers, friendly staff, food looked very good, though we didn't eat here ourselves"
3,"Cheap and nice food but it is always crowded so the staffs are agressive sometimes. So if you don't mind the service, this is a good place to eat."
4,"One of my all time favorites in the Schanze I must admit. Good music, good people, comfy chairs/banks/sofa's. Closing times are rather flexible so I hear (they close at 4am sometimes if there's people around). The look of the place is retro, but that is a normal occurance in the Schanze. It's not huge but it's big enough. Want to chill out and chat and have a cool bottle of beer? This is worth checking out!"
4,Cozy and unique.I love this bar/lounge! Definitely will come back again since it has a wonderful indoor and big outdoor seating. The sofas are really stylish and probably even antique! The walls are just a master piece... its just a great place to have a drink with friends and chill out.
4,"On an early December Sunday,I was fortunate to appreciate this art museum's splendid collection of Renaissance Period paintings by German and Netherlandish painters.German painters with fine Late Gothic and Renaissance Period paintings at this art museum included: Bertram Von Minden(""Altarpiece from ""Harvestehude""),Hinrik Funhof (""Virgin in Robe Decorated With Ears of Corn""),Master Francke((""Christ As Man of Sorrows""),Hans Burgmair the Elder(""Agony in Garden""),Hans Schaufelein(""Nativity"")Barthel Beham(""Vanitas""),Martin Schaffner(""Epitaph of Sebastian Welling""),Lucas Cranach the Elder(""Charity"") and Franz Zimmerman(""Lucretia""),among others.Netherlandish painters from the Renaissance Period with quality paintings included;Marcellis Coffermans,Jan Massys(""Flora"")Jan Provost(""Last Judgement""),Jan Gossaert(""Crucifixion""),and Hans Van Cleve the Third(""Tower of Babel""),among others.Although German and Netherlandish Renaissance Period paintings are emphasized at this art museum,I also saw fine Renaissance Period Italian paintings by Francesco Francia(""Virgin and Child Holding Globe""),Sebastiano di Bartolo Mainardi(""Virgin and Child with John the Baptist""),and Paris Bordone(""Fountain of Bathsheba"").The Kunsthalle's collection of Italian Art is relatively small in comparison to their German,Netherlandish,Dutch,and French paintings.I also appreciated the way the works of Art were arranged,the labeling of works of Art in English for the benefit of foreign visitors,and the helpfulness of its staff."
4,"Top place! Absolutely a must try! Cool ipad ordering system, nice food ;) recommended"
3,"Burgerlich had me licking my fingers. Good thing I came in with clean hands.The burgers here are very juicy and flavorful. And with the accoutrement of the housemade sauce, sundried tomato relish, melting cheese, and a pretty generous helping of mayo, you can expect it to get a little bit messy. Being that the burgers come on a tasty and light brioche bun, by default, you know that a brioche bun can't soak up the entirety of this meaty-juicy mess, so it's gonna get on you. The bathroom is upstairs when you're ready to clean up.The ordering system is pretty fun and novel. They've installed pop-up screens at every seat within the restaurant. Choose your burger and customize via a touchscreen. I didn't get too fancy with my cheeseburger, I just added some bacon on it. Side note: the onion rings here are awesome and I don't normally order or care for onion rings. Another really good hamburger in Hamburg that I've experienced as a new Hamburger."
4,Really cosy place where you can enjoy a good coffee or hot chocolate in a very friendly atmosphere. :)
2,"Previously the Milk bar and now the sands bar. Weird name for a pub that is nowhere next to a beach! I went there after watching a movie at the close by Cinemaxx. I was there relatively early, around 9 pm, the place was still empty, so we secured places at the bar.The bartender and the waitress were very nice, and friendly.The clientele however is a bit older. The DJ kept on playing weird old music, and when we asked him to pump it up a bit, and play newer songs he refused, claiming that the average age here is around ""60"" (exageration!) and they wouldn't appreciate it. So besides the crappy music, the drinks were ok, large selection, tasty cocktails. a bit less than 10EUR / long drink which is fine!"
3,The café is super cute and everything is designed with attention to detail. The atmosphere was very cozy and the staff very friendly.We ordered Bio Rührei which was delicious and also fairly inexpensive! Can highly recommend! They forgot our order once and the bill took quite a while but other than that it was great! :)
1,"Zoo OK, Service Katastrophe Bei dem Eintrittspreis und den vielen Extrakosten könnte man wenigstens für einigermaßen freundliches Personal sorgen. Wird aber leider nicht gemacht. Ob Crepe, Ponyreiten, besonders in der Flamingo Lounge: Wir wurden sehr unfreundlich behandelt. Das Foto zeigt einen Wurm im Bierglas, es gab ein Neues, aber keine Entschuldigung. Am Besten also selbst versorgen und sich nur auf die vielen Tiere konzentrieren."
3,"Went here with someone who had already been there once. I am impressed. Reminded me of the restaurant in the Alsterhaus where you can pick your own food (raw) and have it prepared in front of you. The selection at Copper House is much more extensive and the price is right if you are hungry. I truly enjoyed the food as you can have it made exactly as you wish with the specific sauces you choose yourself. Service is also super nice and I never felt like anything lacked. They didn't bother us when we didn't want to be bothered but were right there as soon as you needed them. Drinks were good as well. Finally, I didn't really miss a large dessert selection as I was already so full from the three plates I had prepared, mostly with fish and vegetables. One minus point is that I am getting somewhat tired of this design style. It looks like every other designer place. It's quite nice so don't get me wrong. It's just not different."
3,"Hier gibt es das perfekte Mittagessen: tolle Salate mit Ziegenkäse und exzellentem Dressing. Außerdem abwechslungsreiche Nudelgerichte. Beides auf Wunsch als 50:50 Gericht.Qualität sehr gut, Preis leicht gehoben im Vergleich zum üblichen Mittagstisch. Einziges Manko: Restaurant Schecks wie Sodexo werden nicht angenommen!"
2,i guess i should try it again.. first time wasn't really that good. not like something was bad  that borshch is just not for my taste
3,"We tried the brand new American Brunch this past Sunday morning. Being an American I am usually fairly skeptical about anything advertised as ""American"". We arrived at 11 am and had our choice of tables inside or out. It was a breezy morning and we sat on the shady side of the house. (There isn't a sunny side this time of morning at the Chilehaus!) Cushions and blankets made the hard wood benches very comfortable. Our order was taken promptly by a friendly waiter and off we went to the buffet. I was quite happy to see pancakes and bacon as well as two types of eggs (scrambled and soft boiled). For the Brits there were sausages and beans, as well. The ""make your own"" waffles were a big hit with my kids and husband. The buffet also had the typical German breakfast items, such as Brötchen, assorted breads and toast bread, cheeses, meats, jams, jellies, cream cheeses, yogurts, etc. I also enjoyed the more lunch-y items: chili, wraps and steamed veggies. All of us finished our brunch off with a giant portion of fresh fruits. The food was good, well-prepared and quickly replenished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The brunch costs just under 15€ and includes a prosecco, a warm drink and an orange juice - quite a bargain, I think. My one and only suggestion would be to put out those mini glass bowls for the maple syrup. We will surely go back again!"
2,"Atlas Restaurant is somewhat hidden in a relatively modern business district in the northwest of Altona. Like some of its surroundings, the restaurant oozes a bit of the red brick loft style that was so fashionable a decade ago. Unfortunately the dining room was rather empty on the evening of my visit, which - together with the empty (except for the cloth and a single candle) tables - made the place feel a bit barren. Service was fast and friendly throughout the evening and is one of Atlas' strong suits. The food, on the other hand, was a bit of a mixed bag. The evening menu is competitively priced (at 28 Euros per head) and includes three courses, which leads one to expect above-average, brasserie style cuisine. The salmon tartar starter was accompanied by pulpo, melted tomatoes and pickled cucumbers - a combination I personally didn't quite understand. The salmon tartar was decent, if a bit bland on its own, but how the other elements should be combined harmoniously eluded me, despite many attempts. The main, Boeuf Bourguignon, was better: the meat was tender and the sauce rich (in a good way), only the vegetables were slightly too tough.Desert was a lovely mousse au chocolate cake with pistacchio ice cream, which left very little to be desired, indeed. Atlas Restaurant is offering more than decent food at a good price. Maybe I'd just caught the wrong day of the week, but I'd probably not go there for dinner again, if the place is always as empty in the evening. Just in terms of food there is little to keep one from exploring the backyards of Altona."
3,"Nice place for the spring or summer, loads of parking and outside space. Our waitresses were very nice, informative and friendly which always helps for a chilled atmosphere. The service was with a smile and the cocktails and wine were better than expected. We had the set menu and enjoyed the overall experience. Try this place!"
3,"This restaurant is pretty good! I visited Ramen Bar Zipang on Saturday night at 6.30pm. There was already a queue but I was able to get a table within 20 minutes. I ordered a bowl of fried chicken and a chashu shoyu ramen. I enjoyed the fried chicken very much, however, although it was crispy and succulent, it was a tad too greasy for it be perfect. I also quite enjoyed the ramen. The ramen stock was thinner than what I was expecting but the portion sizes were great and the ramen was still tasty.At the end of the meal, my ramen cravings were satisfied."
2,"Well , just had a falafel here once for 3,50 , not great ,but a great place when ur hungry and your pocket is tight"
3,"We came here for the 6-course house menu, which will keep you there for a very pleasant three hours.The food was good, rich, and portions sized to made sure you wouldn't leave hungry. All taken together, it was relatively heavy food without too many sides that I should probably not have eaten directly before heading home and going to bed... oh well...Loved some of their dishes - particularly the lamb chops - while others were just ok (e.g. the fried duck was overdone and not too refined). Overall, fair value for the price and a good experience if you want to sample some authentic Chinese cuisine while always staying on the 'safe side' for a Western palate."
1,I've tried this place twice before writing this review and the jury is out now. It's a great looking cafe inside very inviting with comfy seating big arm chairs and dimmed lighting. The problem is Both times I've been here it's taken them more then 5 mins to come up to me where I'm standing at the bar and take my order.The staff don't seem to care that your a customer or potential customer and yesterday after standing there for over 5 minutes without so much as eye contact from the bar staff I just left as it was getting ridiculous. Disapointing.
4,Great restaurant with delicious Food and services! Highly recommend it! Pho is pretty authentic Vietnamese northern region. We went there a few times when we're in Hamburg.
2,"I came here during a night out with a friend last week and it was OK. We were looking for quick easy food that wasn't Italian (as he is Italian!) so coming out of a nearby bar saw this place and the hundred or so people inside and decided to check it out. We didn't even realise it was Chinese until we were inside and nearly walked out - often they are just overpriced buffets - but we had a quick look at the food area and decided to stay. This place seems to differ from the usual all you can eat places because there is a pretty good selection of raw ingredients to choose from which are then stir fried in front of you. Plenty of choice of starters, deserts, sushi; enough to fill you up either before or after a jaunt down the reeperbahn! So at just 50 euro including AYCE food for 2, and 2 large beers it was OK. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner for 2 as its big brash and noisy but for pre or post booze fuel stop its perfectly acceptable."
4,"One very impressive model, amazing animations. I can spend so much time to look all the details."
3,"Came for a late Sunday afternoon lunch after walking around the area. I had no prior knowledge of Tiefenthal and therefore no expectations as my husband picked the spot. They serve breakfast until 4pm on Sunday so I was excited that we arrived at 3:30. I ordered the Eimsbütteler breakfast with the extra 3 scrambled eggs. It's quite a bit of food: 3 eggs, toast, salami, ham, 2 kinds of cheese, 2 rolls, croissant, butter & jam. The food was good - eggs a little dry and croissant was nothing to write home about but I think it all cost 12 euros. We were recently in Paris for a weekend and this kind of breakfast would easily go for 30. The salami and ham were quite good. Service was excellent, space was clean and quiet. My husband and his mom both had the Wienerschnitzel and we all agreed it was pretty good, until we realized they cost 20 euros each! Holy overpriced! We also tried the cheesecake and apricot cake. Neither were very good - not a lot of flavor and dry. I would 100% return for weekend breakfast if I'm in the area."
4,"Best Dim Sum House in Hamburg! After a long but worthwhile wait, Restaurant Mr He finally reopened (after their neighbour burnt down). We went hoping everything would still taste as delicious and authentic as it did and we were not disappointed! The same super friendly waitress was there. The custard buns are to die for, which we always order a portion to takeaway, and so are the xo sauce turnip cakes and pretty much just everything. We highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Cantonese dishes. The prices are worth paying for the quality food and they're not more expensive than other dim sum places."
0,"Oh dear. I'd actually like to limit this review to just four words: avoid at any cost. But instead I'll take my duty seriously and explain the reasons for this blunt warning. Well, let's start with the ambience: this place is the epitome of a tourist trap. The (huge) restaurant is supposed to resemble some random South American village, natural stone walls, a fountain and all. Needless to say, the end result is very tacky. Let's take a look at the service now. When I visited there was literally a busload full of tourists waiting to enter, and the waiters treated them rather poorly, probably knowing that they wouldn't or couldn't leave anyway. I just felt for the poor band of folklore musicians supposed to add flair to the place - those seemed to be the only people trying to make a decent job at Panthera Rodizio. And now, finally, for the food itself: we dined á la carte instead of choosing the all you can eat option, mainly because I just wanted to spend as little money as possible at the place. What I got was a surprisingly nice piece of meat, well cooked - but the side orders were a disgrace and more akin to what you'd expect at a (1970's) motorway restaurant. The vegetables were soggy and completely overcooked, while the sauce was quite obviously courtesy of chef Maggi. All things considered, do yourself a favour and go to Block House instead."
3,"The ice cream shop ""Eiskantine"" offers a small choice of ice cream flavors. The flavors include very common flavors like vanilla and chocolate as well as special flavors like chocolate-mint. The ice cream tasted very good. The shop has its own interesting style and the staff is very nice."
3,"We went here once for breakfast and in my opinion it is a very good price for the tasty breakfast. Another time I tried the pizza, it was a little small in my opinion. The staff was very nice and helpful. One downside was that the street was a bit noisy."
3,This place is perfect for a short stop. Good Service with very friendly servants will offer you a sattisfied stay at this bar. Also the food isn't expensive it is quite good and they are very uncomplicated with fullfilling special wishes and preferences.
3,The Chocoversum is a chocolate museum from the Hachez Company. Our guided tour showed the whole process of chocolate production and we were able to try every step of the process. Furthermore everyone can make an own bar of chocolate. The tour was very informative and interesting. At the end of the tour there is a chocolate shop from Hachez.
3,"Went for lunch on an overcast Tuesday afternoon. Not too busy and we got a table right after ordering. You order with the cashier, pay, and then sit and they bring out your food. I couldn't decide what to order and ended up with the pastrami special that was right in front of my face at the cashier. I asked for the sandwich without bread and over a salad and though confused at first that's exactly what I got! I'm impressed with the customization options here and that the kitchen got it right. The big salad with pastrami and a small bottle of water was 11.60, the ""menu"" price. I was expecting to be charged for the sandwich and the salad so this was a positive. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. Salad wasn't the freshest but it was decent and with plenty of pastrami. I think I was the only person there not eating a burger and fries so I'm assuming they are good too. If I remember well it was cash only, or cash and EC card only so be prepared!"
2,"The Omas Breakfast comes with a lot of cheese (some a little weird and others like the brie a very welcome sight on my plate.)Bread rolls, Meat, Croissants, fruit, juice, a bevvy of spreads and a flute of champers also accompany the breakfast.Plenty of food but a little heavy on the stomach and no good if your not a fan of cheese and bread for breakfast.Was a little disappointed with my boiled egg being boiled much too hard... but other then that the service was quick and the price good."
3,I really liked the cherry chocolate gelato.
3,"Ach, das gute alte Meyer Lansky's- immer eine sichere Sache. Ich muss sagen, dass ich den Service hier immer durch die Bank weg erstaunlich gut finde. Die bieten dir schon einen neuen Drink an, wenn der alte noch nicht ganz aufgetrunken ist...naja, ist vielleicht manchmal gar nicht schlecht, wenn es mal ne kurze Pause zwischendurch gibt ;) Hilfsbereit, wenn man an einen anderen Tisch umziehen will und den Cocktail bekommt man noch zu Happy Hour Preisen, wenn man ihn vor dem Ende der Zeit schon mal reserviert hat. 1 A. Toiletten sind auch zu später Stunde noch völlig ok. Was ich allerdings richtig schrecklich finde, ist, dass man in dem Laden rauchen darf. Schade!"
4,"Very good restaurant, a little price for a tasty food. Ask their noodles if you don't have too much ideas."
3,"Really nice new-ish place on the catwalk that is Schuterblatt, hence, a bloody good venue from which to enjoy a cold Augustinabrau. The signs on the toilet doors to indicate the correct genders permitted are not to be missed!"
1,I was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Food was not better than normal Imbiss but more expensive. I won't come back again.
4,"Tasty food. I've been in Europe for 2 months and this was my first burger since being here... I was very pleased! I had the BBQ burger and I would definitely recommend it! I got the menu, which ended up being a bit too much food for me, but it was worth the price."
1,"In the 'Portuguese' area of Hamburg, a large restaurant serving Portuguese food.  We were asked if we had booked so thought the restaurant must get very busy (it wasn't at the time we got there).  We were shown to a table in a reasonably empty restaurant.Felt the menu was a bit 'samey' and struggled a little to find something 'exciting' to eat.  Leaving the starters and go straight into the mains.  The food was OK but nothing to shout about.Staff were very friendly thought and accommodated my typical English and 'not speaking any other language'.  The restaurant never became busy so not sure about the fuss of 'have you booked'.  Probably would not rush back here but OK to come back if I had to."
3,"Our first choice of restaurant was fully booked (we'd forgotten to reserve a table), and the host there recommended this place near by.    we had a decent pizza (quite spicy) and a pasta.  The pasta seemed slightly undercooked (not quite al-dente yet).  This would normally cause me to rate them at 3 stars, but they had a nice wine (Brunello di Montalcino) for a decent price, which bumps them back up to 3 1/2, so I will be generous and give four."
3,"Joh. Albrecht is a large, central, brewery restaurant that serves predominantly German fare. I've only been once, and then only for the beer, which is very good. I keep on telling myself I should go and try their lunch menu, as it's so close to where I work"
4,Walking in the door the delicious smell of brewing beer. Chicken spinach curry was today's special for 7 Euros. Messing beer also delicious and reasonable.
4,"Great! I'm from California and this is my first time trying to eat Mexican food here. Not that it's so easy to find. I had the chorizo burrito and it's GIGANTIC! I just finished the rest of it for dinner. The chorizo is actually spicy, which surprised me, since it is Germany. haha. The people are really nice there. It's clean, not too expensive,but a little crowded at lunch. I will definitely go back and try all the other things. Es war toll! Ich komme aus Kalifornien und das war meine erste mal Mexicanessen zu probieren. Es ist ziemlich schwer zu finden. Ich habe den Chorizo Burrito bestellt und es ist RIESIG! Ich habe gerade die Reste für Abendessen gegessen. Die Chorizo ist scharf, es war eine Überraschung. haha. Die Leute sind sehr nett. Das Restaurant ist sauber, nicht so teuer, aber ein bisschen eng in die Mittagspause. Ich gehe gern zurück und wurde gern alle die andere Sachen probieren."
4,"I picked out Nasch because of their phenomenal reviews on Yelp, and because my wife is vegetarian. We met up there earlier this week for lunch.The restaurant is quite small, with maybe 20 seats in the front, and another small room in the back (never actually went back there). We grabbed a couple of seats at a communal table, and although it was really tight in there, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. You order at the counter, and they bring your food to the table.I had the masamun curry with red rice, which was a huge portion (see photo) and very satisfying. It had big chunks of pumpkin, sweet potato, and eggplant, and came in a pretty spicy (in a good way) red coconut milk curry sprinkled with green onions, parsley, and peanuts. It's one of the best plates of food I've eaten in Hamburg; I was really blown away.My wife had the quiche, which, because it was vegan, she said was mostly potatoes and sweet potatoes. It was a large slice, and came with a side salad. She was also very satisfied.We split a peanut butter cookie for dessert, which I'm guessing was also vegan, but was soft and delicious like a normal (butter-laden) peanut butter cookie.I would absolutely recommend this place for a casual and hearty lunch, whether you're vegan or not. I hope to be back many times."
3,"An excellent Nopales burrito in Hamburg?  Sure, why not!The burritos are grilled (think panini press), which gives a great crispy texture to two sides.  The nopales were nicely juicy; the strangely gooey dairy component fell somewhere between Jack and sour cream, but managed to work.  Good black beans and rice added some bulk, and there's Tapatío on the tables.Yes, Jim Burrito is known for long waits --- the sign currently warns of wait times upwards of 30 minutes --- but we got lucky and grabbed the last burritos before they closed.  Short wait this time...The friendly staff is happy in either German or English."
4,"Visiting Hamburg for 6 days and we've decided to have dinner again at Xeom.Loved the food and service.Great food, atmosphere and a very fair price."
4,Perfect place for perfect ice cream. I love that it is clean and modern with outside seating. The ice cream is fantastic and the flavors include transit as well as some newer trendy flavors. Prices are fair and coffee/tea drinks are also available. I will definitely be back!
1,"Well, where to start?? The company I work for had their traditional team lunch and I suggested the Hard Rock Cafe. Big mistake! I should have known to have waited a few months before going so that the staff learns what is needed and everyone there is comfortable. It opened at 12pm however we got there about 2 minutes before and waited behind the red rope. They didn't actually open the doors till about 12:05pm and even when they did that they were very slow with letting people in.We did ask ahead of time for a reservation but were told they do not take any at this time but in a few weeks. Our party of 18 got to the door and was offered to come into the bar area and wait for a few minutes till they arrange some tables for us. We had requested to sit outside on the roof but were told it was not open this day. Strange considering they push the fact they have this great roof deck and it was a really great summer day!!Finally after about 5 minutes of waiting inside we were seated upstairs in the Jimmy room. It was quite hot and this could have something to do with the fact it is located near the kitchen?? Our party of 18 was separated into 2 tables, each having their own server.We ordered our drinks promptly and received them a few minutes later. As soon as we received our drinks we ordered our meals. The server was obviously not familiar with the menu yet and we had to constantly point to the menu for her to read even though we spoke German to her.After about 1.5 hrs the food started to come out. However, it was coming out in spurts. A couple plates, waiting a few minutes, then a couple more. It then came down to the last 2 plates, (mine and another persons). After another 10 minutes his plate came and I was told mine was coming. In fact I had 3 different people come over and tell me it was coming. I was then given a plate of cold fries to keep me satisfied till it arrived.When it finally came, everyone else had already finished. I then asked for a box so I could just take it with me and was told it was not possible as they do not have take away boxes but she would ask anyway. While she was away I noticed the food on my plate was not resembling what I had ordered. I looked around and then asked for a menu and sure enough it was not what I ordered. I showed this to the server and instead of telling me she was sorry she just told me it was correct. I told her to please take it back and we would take the check.Another fact, we never got an apology from anyone. They did take off the cost of my food but that was it. Clearly this location is not yet fully up and running as it should be.I have been to many and the service and food is excellent. It should also be noted that the prices of the menu seem to be higher then the other locations as well. Everything seemed to be between 10 and 20€ and drinks between 6 and 10€.I will wait a couple months before going back and maybe then I will edit this review."
0,"Terrible service for less than mediocre sushi. For that kind of food, it's better to do a take out from an Imbiss."
3,"Great beer, lively restaurant, and, at least to an American, great tasting German food at a reasonable price. Would definitely visit again."
2,"This HB location in Hamburg is not as good as the Haufbrauhaus in Munich, Berlin or Las Vegas. The food is all the same great quality however the atmosphere is not as festive as the others. We came in on a Thursday evening at about 6:45pm. We were met at the front door by two muscle bound ape security guards that seemed to intimidate customers by their presence. We, however were seated right away even though we did not have reservations. The service was good and prompt, however there was no live Bavarian music after 7pm like the others, just the football game on tv. The food and beer was good as expected, but not much fun after that."
3,Love this place. Love the wall paper. Love the free mini Lucky Strike matches. Love the music. Came here once a bit too early I think about 11pm (although that's quite late for an English person!) and it was really quiet and my boyfriend fell asleep But when this place is packed it's definitely one of the best places in the city to go.
4,"This is one of the greatest accomplishments in the existence of human creation. If you're going to be in Hamburg, there are only 2 things you must do:1) Get a delicious hamburger2) Go to Miniatur WunderlandYou will be 1000% amazed with your senses overloaded. I think the best model is the airport. I could sit there for an hour just watching it operate. Do not miss watching the Millennium Falcon take off.One activity I wish I did was the challenge where you find certain objects/people and solve a puzzle. I was just too amazed when I walked in that I didn't even know the welcome brochure had the puzzle in it. I will definitely be back here in the future and will undergo said challenge.You can spend forever here so plan accordingly. While my daughter loved it a lot, she got tired after a while of awing at the miniature greatness in front of us.Just wow!"
4,"Great DJ, great bartenders, inexpensive drinks, friendly and fun patrons!  Did I mention the bartenders are good looking?  What more can you ask for?  Well, I guess the bathrooms could be a bit better.  If you are in Hamburg, this is definitely a cool place to come check out!"
2,whatever happens do not order the chuck steak! it is a piece of sh...flubber...or fat rubber...if you respect your stomach and want that organ to stay intact...get the sirloin instead. the sirloin was nicely cooked and tasted proper. The waiter was nice enough to refund my appetizer because i had to spit out the chuck steak into the plate....So for the good sirloin and the customer service..this place gets 3 stars for my taste....I really hope they remove the sub-par food from their menu.
3,"Great restaurant off the beaten path, in Eimsbüttel, one of Hamburg's liveliest and most interesting neighborhoods. The name is unusual, referring to swimming lessons, and there is a bowling alley in the basement. It's this quirky personality that makes the Freischwimmer charming. The decor is a sort of simple chic that reflects Hanseatic understatement. The food is interesting and well executed - a combination of German and Mediterranean. The wine list short but quality. And the service is knowledgeable, attentive and friendly."
3,"This was a very good eating experience at a very reasonable price for a competitive high end menu in a friendly ambience. We sampled all the appetizers, I was especially taken by the grilled calamari and the ceviche, not too crazy about the tatar. Fellows at my table had the dorade and the risotto with prawns and I heard good things about those as well. I went for the raised ochsenbacke which are the butt cheeks of the ox. That was a delightful piece of meat, extremely tender and flavorful, with a green mash potato better than any mash potato i have had. Their creme brulee is worth a try. Service was a bit slow."
2,Decent Italian food. It does what it says on the tin.
4,immer & immer wieder SUPER !!! Excellent & herrvorragend einfach !From the very best for the price !
3,"I highly recommend this place, it's a lot cooler and more local than all the touristy spots on the reeperbahn, and it's a bit of an older and more hip crowd (mostly people 30s and above, but I'm not even 20 and didn't feel weird at all). We were the only non-Germans it seemed like. It took us a while to get our cocktails, and they weren't exactly cheep, but it was well worth it because they were AMZING. Best cocktails I've ever had, and shots are pretty well priced! The interior of the bar is super funky, the bartenders are fun, beautiful, and amazing, and all the people here were so friendly. All in all this place has a great vibe and we had a really fun Saturday night!"
0,"Wir waren heute abend dort! Nach einem Versuch von vor 2 Monaten, mal wieder griechisch essen zu gehen. Nachdem wir uns hingetzt hatten, wurden zwei Karten mit den Worten Auch was essen? auf den Tisch gelegt. Wir haben dann ewig gesessen und darauf gewartet, dass jemand die Bestellung entgegen nimmt. Vergebens! Nach 15 Minuten sind wir dann aufstanden und gegangen. In diese Kommerz - Tempel war ich das letzte Mal. Schließlich haben wir dann zwei Straßen weiter in der Behringstraße die Taverna Sotiris gefunden - Ein Traum!"
4,"Have always had a great experience here. The interiors are very cool and the cocktails are very good. Let's just say the drinks are complicated in a good way. Only problem sometimes, it can get super crowded."
3,"Rather interesting town hall area - large and fairly impressive. To any tourists, it is not a place you need to plan into your trip, as I found I inadvertently passed through the area several times whilst crisscrossing the city trying to see different sights. Not saying the town hall is not worth a stop, the architecture is worth a picture moment in its own rights (and I am not a buff in that area, to me, it looks nice), but given the location, it is easily reachable from different ends of the city. Visited during Spring, so the area was pretty lively and picturesque. Would definitely be on my list of interesting places in Hamburg."
3,"I love the french toast with maple syrup and fresh freuit. for 5,00€ i think it is a pretty good deal.I'm tempted to try out the salads but I know that my bill will be a LOT more expensive. but I'm sure it is all very delicious!the place is always PACKED on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/Brunch... if you don't reserve, you might not have a chance.my only disappointment is that they list red velvet cupcakes on their website as a kind of the baked goods, but I've been there several times and they never have them available. :-(  whyyyy?!?!  i would be so many and so often. ;-)"
4,"Love it - possibly in the top 5 of all German restaurants I have ever been to. warm atmosphere, a friendly and fast service, typical French meals, excellent quality and very tasteful food! All that for a price that is easily affordable (33€ the 3 course menu)."
4,"Really nice Mexican place in the schanze! I was initially worried that I'd not find much to eat on the menu given that spicy food and I don't get along very well, but the staff recommended a few dishes I might like and I wasn't disappointed. I had a really nice mexican sandwich with an omelette and avocado - one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! Recommended for some authentic mexican food for a decent price in the Schanze."
2,"We thought it was a regular sit-down type of restaurant when we first popped in before we realized it was just a much nicer fast food burger joint than we had back home. The menu isn't super descriptive and I don't speak German, but I was able to make out some of it from the online menu and photos.I got the regular size (one patty) JB Champignon, which came with mushrooms, cheese, and sautéed onions. I decided to make it a combo with their freshly made lemonade and garlic bread instead of fries, because I had never seen it as a side to a burger before (not thinking there would be an excessive amount of bread). I'm a big eater but the burger turned out to be larger and wider than I had expected, so I was glad I only got the one patty instead of two. These are the kind of burgers you might want to eat with a fork and knife! The burger also came with lettuce and, unexpectedly, this creamy, mayo-based type of sauce, which was good but got to be overwhelming and very heavy near the end. I ended up scraping some of the sauce off the bun and then later gave up on the bun to eat most the garlic bread instead.Like some other restaurants in Europe, my husband had to pay extra for ketchup, which was their own chain brand that came in a big packet. I also took a couple sips of his Fritz-kola, which is a soda brand made in Hamburg. My husband was also very stuffed with meal (I think he got a two-patty JB BBQ, but I can't remember).We were both really impressed with some of the people around us who were licking their plates clean. It seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck, though more expensive for us in general with the conversion rates from Canadian into Euros. Clean washrooms, quick and fast service, less waste because of the real cutlery and plates they give you - I can see why this place/chain is so popular!"
4,Great burgers for a really fair price. Funny and welcoming service. Definitely worth checking out! Jan bester man!!
4,"Ich war das erste Mal im Locks und war total begeistert. Der Service war erste Klasse und das Essen oberlecker. Es war knacke voll ab 19 Uhr, aber für mich steht fest ... ich weiß, wo ich wieder hin gehe."
4,"A club that looks like a scout hut! A first - but as bad as this concept sounds it's actually pretty good. If I wasn't so damn ill I'd be there tonight. Grüner Jäger means ""Green Hunter"" in German. My good friend in absentia is also a Hunter - so I will take him here when he gets back. The beer is cheap, there are comfy sofas, a big dance floor, regular live music, young crowd, table football upstairs... it's a very decent hangout. Not as stylish as the Sofabar across the road, but more music going on."
4,I just found this coffee place and checked it! I had a cappuccino and a piece of their homemade cheesecake. The cheesecake was very good. Homemade and with a coconut flavor. The topping was strawberry jam but im not sure if homemade. Anyway the cheesecake was awesome!! Lovely place and friendly service!
2,"There's nothing wrong with Chakra, in my opinion. The interior is comfortable enough, with a mix of couches and chairs; the staff is friendly and moderately attentive, and the prices are, well, fine. It's just the mediocre nature of the place--just another bar/cafe/restaurant in the Schanze. We both had vegetable tacos and a beer, and in keeping with the general feel, were neither disappointed nor particularly impressed. How very--ho hum."
1,"Tables were open and not reserved. Very arrogant staff asked us to wait outside in the cold. Some more tables cleared up, we went back in, got asked to wait outside again. Food looked great, but the staff was horrible."
3,"Better than the average British indie night. Ended up here, en route to the Schanze, and stayed all night. EUR4 entry and EUR2.50 for a bottle of lager is pretty reasonable for a Saturday and the music was the same clichéd bands you'd hear in the UK: Oasis, Blur, Joy Division but with more variety- eg instead of playing Love will tear us apart they played Disorder. Not recommended if you want something quentissentially Hamburg, but a good safe bet."
4,"Fantastic cafe in St. Pauli for sunny days. There's a little ledge outside you can enjoy your coffee on, and it catches the morning sun perfectly. Delicious bread, eggs, meat, cheese and salad. And nice people. Recommend."
1,"Food is pretty mediocre and the service is completely indifferent at best and downright rude and negligent at worst.  I go here very often as it is close to my workplace and there are relatively few choices in the area, especially after 9pm."
4,"I am going to go ahead and give this place five stars. I'd be tempted to dock them one star due to the exorbitant pricing but to be honest, it's almost worth it. Yes, they are expensive and even more importantly, yes you knew this coming here. If you really think you are going to see this menu and not find it expensive then you shouldn't be here in the first place.Now, on to the food. Great, great steaks. Presented as steaks should be.....raw and on a platter for you to choose your cut. I had the ribeye (400g) which had a perfect blend of fat and meat and ordered it medium rare as quality meat should be cooked. Perfect.....not one complaint and I finished almost every last scrap of this cut, which very smartly came out on a hot plate......dislike when they don't do this with larger cuts as it cools off too quickly before you can finish it. The sides were just as good. We had the spinach, the beans with bacon and the steamed vegetables. Perfect.....everything just as I like it.Service is also top notch. We did seem to constantly have different people coming to the table...one for orders of starters, one for the order of drinks (bottles of wine in our case), one who brought the first course and so forth. Yet, everyone was super nice. Really liked this.One side note......and this is not meant negatively. I ordered some barbecue sauce to try it with the meat. This barbecue sauce was horrendous. I absolutely hated it. Yet, it doesn't mean it was bad. It just wasn't my style and I talked with the guy who seems to run this place about this. I very clearly told him I hated it but it didn't interfere with my meal at all. I was lucky I didn't pour it over my steak. One tip: simply keep the sauces on the side and try them before drenching your steak in them. You may love them. I didn't.Finally, if someone isn't going to eat steaks don't come here with them. My g/f for example doesn't eat steaks. Hence she won't be seeing the inside of Butchers. Don't get me wrong....I'd love to take her here but it's a waste. If someone isn't into meat, leave them at home and come here with your buddies......or preferably invited by someone with an expense account (as was my case!)"
4,"Let me preface this by writing that normally, I am not much of a zoo person. However, I was really impressed with Hamburg's Tropen Aquarium. I was amazed at the lemur exhibitthe lemurs jump on your shoulders, leap from ledge to ledge, and scurry around the floor. The zoo keeper in charge could tell them all apart and was clearly very experienced. While the lemurs were by far my favorite part of the aquarium, I also really liked the variety of fish and reptiles they had. I even got to see a live feeding of the sharks! You don't have to be a kid to be really wow'ed by this place."
3,"I have been here more times then I can remember but recently came to partake in a going away celebration for a co-worker. The food is typical Southern German style and the portions are huge. There is only one thing that is larger than their schnitzel and that is there beer! After all, that is why you go to Hofbräuhaus. It is a huge location with plenty of seats, folk music, and good times. However, if you plan on going you should call ahead and make a reservation. While there you will not only enjoy the beer and food you will be immersed in the Bavarian German culture. Women in their checkered dresses, men in their Lederhosen, and big, burly men chugging pints of beer. You will not be let down!"
4,"Entirely unique, weird, fun, and a must-see for Hamburg visitors with a few days to fill. This is what happens when you give a group of manic model train enthusiasts a few million to play with, and the results go from hilarious to stunning. Expect to spend a few hours on your feet, and not notice them go by. Usually quite crowded, so booking in advance for a specific time slot is recommended. A little restaurant/café with cute booths that simulate train seating is on the premises, so if you need to refuel you'll be set. Right next door to the over-the-top-animatronic-fest that is the Hamburg Dungeon, so it makes sense to pair those, especially if the weather's bad."
3,"Strandperle is a beach bar, that quite unlike most beach bars in Hamburg is actually on the beach! Unfortunately the beach that it's on is the slightly crappy Elbstrand, but even so you can have a great time here. They do beer, wine, snacks and full meals. It's all a little bit overpriced, but hey, you're on a beach, so that's to be expected. I recommend coming in the late evening, watching the sun go down and then staying to watch the port at night. Last time I visited we actually got to watch the moon set too! (With a glass of Riesling)"
0,"Had duck with vegetables and rice with peanut-curry sauce. The meat, if it was meat, tasted absolutely artificial and the sauce neither tasted like peanut sauce nor had a kind of curry taste. Somewhat unidentically! The meat was extremely tender and underneath the panade was dough or something. The ""meat"" to my mind was some kind of fake which had no meat content at all. Overall it was a really unpleasant experience. Never again!!"
0,"The pros:   * thoughtful, attentive , gracious service;         * casual atmosphere with solid wooden tables;         *  the pizza has great texture, with crispyness outside and a softened interior crust loaded with gooey, bubbly cheese;        * when I couldn't decide between two pizzas, the server offered to make the pizza half and half - - really appreciated that!The cons:    * the pizza was a salt bomb - - the meats are salty, the cheeses are salty - - but even the CRUST is excessively salty;  each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by salt - - since I got half  'Salsiccia und Peperoni'  and half  'Speck und geräuchertem Scamorza'  I thought the other half would have more character and be less salty - - but uh uh - - and this really overwhelms the contrasts of flavor of the individual ingredients;     * you are served bread and a dip to start - - the bread is forgettable, and the dip tastes like pure mayonnaise - - godawful;        * the many little peperoni tasted like the brine they are packed in from the can or jar - - they are anything but fresh - - and they still had the stems on, so you had to either try to surgically remove the stems without destroying the pizza underneath,  or eat them as is and try to spit out the stems;         *   the salsiccia were little round blackish balls that rolled around on the slice when you tried to eat them, and had little flavor since they were overcooked;         * I ordered a kellerbier,  and it was foul - - either they have no turnover so the keg is old,  or they haven't cleaned the lines in a long time - - or both.Would I eat at Ai Volo again?    Even when in the mood for a bubbly, gooey, beautifully textured 'za - - I wouldn't eat that salt bomb again,  and I now don't at all trust their choice and blending of ingredients.  I wouldn't drink a beer there again either."
4,bestice creamevertry snickers!! It was incredible and I would go there any time. Little expensive but totally worth it
2,"Great burrito, best I've had in germany. Not too authentic (I'm mexican and live in cali so i'm a lil picky) but still delicious. Took a while to get the food, but our burrito was hot till the last bite and delicious. The steak chunks are a bit big and i wasn't too keen on having to use a knife and fork for a burrito. Cool staff, super friendly, and overall a great burrito."
4,"best currywurst i ever had. Came here last weekend for a quick snack before seeing There Will Be Blood, and left 10 minutes later completely sated. Obviously I had currywurst and fries. I also had an ""African"" cider, which was quite nice too. The guys running the place were really friendly, if a bit camera shy (I asked for a photo)."
4,"Not the cheapest lunch option around at about EUR9, but certainly a unique one. The various meals that I saw around our table all had a thin, almost soupy sauce, on rice & vegetables with either tofu or meat all contained in rather elegant bowls. I also ordered a green tea, which was a great decision! My colleague, Liron (see her review), had some issues with it being too spicy, but my dish was fine. It is worth noting that they don't serve anything without spice though"
4,"Really authentic, I am a Chinese myself. I always come here, and the quality is good, quantity it's also fine."
3,"The location is not suitable for finding this restaurant ""just by walking"". The interior is not something you want if you do fine dining. But the steaks and burgers are just awesome. They take the meat business very seriously. I mean VERY. Guaranteed you do not leave hungry from this place.For casual dinner with friends who like burgers and steaks, this is a must place to test. Keep in mind, that they accept cash only, no credit cards, so prepare yourself with cash when you arrive. The prices are not too high, but due to meat coming form USA, it is more expensive than normal restaurants serving meat."
3,"I like Thämers. It offers a friendly, beery old-style pub ambience without a hint of oompahpah or that sneaking suspicion that they're putting it on just for you. Much more personality than the other offerings at Großneumarkt. Food is hearty but good (mountains of bratkartoffeln with everything!) and I find myself coming back here often for dinner and to sit and read outside over a beer and enjoy the balmy summer evenings."
4,Very good service and excellent foos!
2,"ahhh roschinskys. I have ended many a night in here, and always wondered, well, why? Its exactly the same as every other bar long the street. It has the same people (are they cardboard cut-outs?) it even has the same drinks and the same bar staff. Not really original in my eyes and nothing special to write home about. The people are friendly enough, the crowd is youngish and the music is ok. nothing out of the ordinary, and too crowded late at night for my tastes."
4,"We ordered Nouko Ramen, Gyoza, fried chicken, they all taste good, but I can't really tell whether it's because the food or because I'm too hungry, we waited 40min to get the table.Anyway, I will come again. Now, time for ice cream \o/"
2,"A pretty good burger here although it's more than just burgers and not really a restaurant. A bit on the pricy side but a good choice and good quality. A nice touch is them giving your order a local street name rather than a number, e.g. Jaguarstieg or Königstraße."
4,"An absolutely wonderful experience. I hadn't expected much and was really overwhelmed by the amount of detail in the tableaus. There really is something for all ages in the Mini Wunderland, and my whole family spent a lot of time marveling over the beautiful landscapes. I recommend booking an early time-slot; it only gets more crowded during the day. Take the guided tour and get behind the scenes. It's worth the €15!If you're head is filled up after a few hours, you can get a stamp on your hand and return later in the day. There's always more to explore!"
3,"I've always loved dioramas, so Miniatur Wunderland was totally up my alley. I really enjoyed all the exhibitions. The details are amazing! It was fun trying to look for cute and funny things in the models. We spent a good amount of time at the Flughafen exhibit--so cool seeing the model airplanes land and take off.We made reservations for 3:30-4:30pm. I would recommend this so you don't have to wait. Needless to say, it was pretty crowded since it's the weekend. Since the place is open until late, I would got after dinner or later next time. Hopefully it won't be as crowded. We saw an Italy exhibit under construction, so looking forward to checking it out next time!"
3,"My friends constantly referred to this place as the best Turkish restaurant in Hamburg, so we finally went there on Saturday at 2 AM. I was not disappointed! I only tried the Doner Teller, which was of decent size, and good taste. It was a bit cold, but nothing too serious.The service was great, even though the restaurant was full at 2 AM! Will definitely come by next time I am around the area"
0,"YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT! What you get is 2 sweet girls who understand customer service and one male manager who does not!1. What we ordered 4 cheeseburgers and 6 orders of chicken wings2. What we got 4 cheeseburgers on english muffin buns? 6 chicken wings?!French fries made with old stale oil.  ketchup, mayo----oops no napkins?3. A manager telling me HOW IT IS - mam your order is wrong because you ordered wrong!! hmmm I rememebr in 7th grade business class 101 ""The customer is always right"" NOT HERE-THE BIRDFu*kUVERYMUCH for your service"
3,Best lunch place in the area. The Pizza is delicious and the price is unbeatable... For just 4€ you get the classics like Salami etc.At night time the place is usually packed and you have to expect some waiting time. Even with a reservation which gets you wondering why they bother to take them in the first place. With the check comes a complementary bottle (!) of Sambuca... which not too bad (except for the morning afterwards).The focus on the menu really are the pizzas. Just once tried some pasta and it was average at best. So don't even think about anything else.
3,"Good Ol'e Jim Block. The ugly step child of Block House. Ok maybe not ugly but they're definitely related. Anyway, put that McDonalds burger down and head over to Jim Block because for about the same price you can have some real food! Everything is made right in front of you, it's fresh, it's fast, it's real, and most importantly, it's good.The only downside here, (at least at this location) is that there never seems to be enough seating. It is a rather small location which has very few seats. The lines are usually to the door if not out. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone who had their heart set on McDonalds or Burger King."
4,"Very good meat, very good pieced together burgers in general. Very comparable to an american chain called BurgerFI. I'll be back on my next visit, thank you."
3,"Being relatively new in Hamburg (living here since about eight months), my girldfriend and me went there last Sunday for the first time. At the door my girlfriend had to show the contents of her bag because they wanted to make sure we don't bring any bottles with us. I don't think this is necessary, but hey, it's their club and we had to play by their rules.We were quite lucky finding two seats on a Sunday afternoon and had a fantastic look on the river. I ordered two Astra Alsterwasser at the bar (self-service only) and paid 2,70 EUR each. This definitively is too expensive for this local drink and was the reason we didn't stay for another drink.However, the decoration at this beach club is indeed very stylish (the car grill as a bbq grill is awesome! :) ) and I would suggest to go there at least once to see it."
4,"Excellent vegetarian food! Great tastes to experience, well-made food. Service was a bit slow, but the food was well worth it! Also a nice seating area outside."
3,Great food and service. Not so great when it comes to location. But we go to restaurants for the food and not the location ;)
4,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here during our stay in Hamburg and I can safely say it was the best meal of my life. Armando was incredibly friendly and accommodating (since I'm a vegetarian.) Each of the four courses was better than the last, and the wine pairing was excellent. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys food. Wonderful, wonderful experience!"
3,If you are ever in Hamburg. Don't miss this place! The schnitzel was excellent as well as the potato pancakes Nice atmospheric. Truly enjoyed. C
2,Delicious but maybe not as hyped as everyone says. Not worth waiting 30-40min by any means.
4,"The coffee is ground exactly right, the milk is done to perfection and I even have a gorgeous little pattern on the top of my milk.. what am I drinking??? The most amazing, delicious, done to perfection LATTE!!! Finally! Who would have thought???!! I was almost having a breakdown thinking that the only place I could get a real latte was back at home in Melbournehowever, Swedish Cream has come to the rescue! It is a tiny tiny shop right where the Hallerstrasse U barn is where you can sit in or take away, and grab a piece of cake at the same time. The staff are really friendly and laid back, and efficient with their service. So even if you are in a hurry, there will always be time to grab a quick coffee to go from here!! I tend not to sit in here and have my coffeeit does not really have the atmosphere to make me want to lounge around, so I just come here to literally grab my coffe and go. However, many people like to stay in and sit on the stools at the window (while getting in some great people watching!!). The shop even holds classes on how to make coffee which is a great idea. I will be back hereevery dayhaving now to get up earlier just so that I have enough time to take the detour to Swedish Cream when driving to work!"
3,"Got here close to when they opened and one of the wait staff members informed me that the kitchen was still preparing and that I couldn't order just yet but I was welcome to wait in the restaurant.I didn't mind the wait and everyone was very nice. After about 20 or 30 min, the waitress came by and took my order and my noodle soup came out at a reasonable time. An hour past after they opened and I could tell this is a popular lunch spot as the place was filling up very quickly so be here to get here early to avoid the lunch rush.The menu changes frequently and while they do have a menu with some staples, seems like everyone is looking at their specials board that changes everyday I believe. I ordered off the specials board - noodle soup.The noodle soup was really great! Had a lot of great flavors and on a cold day, this helped to warm me up! I love the vibe of this place! The staff is super friendly and they have a great lunch selection that will please your taste buds.I will be sure to come back to try more!"
2,"This place is basically OK if you're up for pizza. I can't complain about the taste and size-wise it's nice and big. I actually managed not to finish mine yesterday which is a rarity for me. I was eating my dinner date's dish along for her though so that's my excuse. I find even at night that place is priced well but everything is very basic. The house wine is not all that good so there goes a star. Further, sitting inside at the front or outside is good but the back room is pretty dreary in my opinion. Finally, while we were there, only one waiter was working and he was busy. Service was very slow although the guy was quite nice. If in the area and up for a pizza, a good place to stop in. I wouldn't hump over here though extra to check this place out. One final positive note: when you pay, you get a shot of either grappa or something sweet. We chose the grappa."
4,Great selection of top quality meat but most impressive is the wine list. This place is serious about wine with the biggest selection of American wine I have seen in Europe. The Sommelier was also really great she recommended a Ridge Zinfandel with a little age. It went great with our Danish dry aged (90days)! They even show all the meat dry aging. This is great for a date night or celebration. Price quality was on point.
4,"Brilliant. Very impressed with this place. Had a lovely lamb steak with a honey-mustard sauce and figs. Very reasonably priced, stylish and friendly. The place was full on a Monday evening  that says everything."
4,It's a little hidden place where you will find great and affordable meals. Even in the middle of the night you'll receive lovingly crafted vegetarian food. You can also rent the place for your personal events.
4,Very good sushi and other dishes! Very nice waiters and good quality fish! Very recommendable!
4,"Found this restaurant via Yelp and it was an absolute triumph! The food was delicious and was served extremely fast, the service really nice and the decor warm and homey.We had 7 starters and dessert. The Mangold with lemon and oil was delicious. Same goes for the fried fish and grilled octopus. The lamb leg meat melted off and was juicy and flavorful and the bread warm and crunchy. For two hungry people, it was perhaps a little much, but 6 starters would have been perfect Don't forget to add a serving of Tzaziki and finish off with honey cake balls.I would recommend making a reservation. We went Saturday night and if we hadn't called ahead, we wouldn't have found a seat."
4,"Super! It is my Wednesday tradition now. I always order No 25, Klein gemuseteller mit Dönner . Sorry about the spelling. I tried my best. Sometimes I tried No 38 and something on the special. The food is good and worth its price."
3,"I went there for lunch. The food tastes good and the service is lightning fast. The saladbar was fresh, but they could have given us a broader sortiment to chose from.Overall: Good place for a quick meal."
3,"We went for dinner on a Thursday and it was quite quiet, but this may also be due to the bad weather outside which doesn't really attract walk in customers. We had a three course menu with the accompanying wines and thought it was pretty good. The soup was very good, the fish was a huge portion and tasted good, but wasn't hot anymore. Dessert was a chocolate tarte which I believe should have been with a liquid core, which it wasn't The server was very nice and friendly, though a bit unsure at times. With better weather we would come back."
4,That was definitely the fastest served burger i've ever had. It was also tasty. Fries could be better though. Still 5 stars because i enjoyed the burger and dont care about fries.
3,Price worthy food in a nice atmosphere.I had the most wonderful schnitzel with actually wonderful potatoes (they're not so often wonderful but these were) and chanterelle in sauce. A lovely dinner indeed.
4,"Really great food - excellent selection, friendly service, if a little slow. Really big portions. The grill for two people was especially nice."
4,"After a wonderful Hamburg harbor tour, we found our way to the Fairmont Hotel-recommended Clouds for the view, drinks and some food. It was sunny but cool and windy and our group of 7 found the top floor outdoor bar not right for us so we went down one floor to the inside bar/restaurant. We were told that area wasn't open for another 2 hours but we stayed to take in the great view and plan our next moves. When I approached the bartender (Dougie sp?) to discuss our options, he quickly provided menus for drinks and food, not at other places, but at Clouds. I finally got it that it was fine to stay and he was incredible with prompt beers, two bottles of wine, snacks and food. He even provided a complimentary strawberry champagne drink and nachos. He made our afternoon even more delightful and was another wonderful example of the welcoming attitude of the great people of Hamburg. Don't miss enjoying Clouds! What a great bartender and an employee of Clouds. Thanks!"
3,"This place has pretty tasty food since re-branding. It used to be called something else and had a similar selection but different design and less outdoor seating. I usually get Müsli or Muffins to go plus coffee. At lunch they have great soups and salads plus a bunch of changing options. I've always been happy with the food. Unfortunately the place has become quite trendy and especially when the weather is good, a ton of people swarm it. Then it takes quite some time to get your food as service behind the bar seems disorganized. Nevertheless it's definitely worth coming for breakfast or lunch as the food really is good. It's all smack in the middle of town so a good option if coming in to go shopping or whatever."
4,"This was the BEST felafel EVER! I had the Felafel with grilled eggplant - AMAZING! What makes their felafel's soooo good, is that each layer is different, no two bites are the same! With a mixture of texture and flavor you look forward to the next bite and don't want it end!"
4,This place was absolutely amazing! The line was pretty long so I highly recommend getting your tickets online. The buffet had decent food and the prices were reasonable.
4,"Kartoffel Keller! I loved everything about this restaurant. At first glance, Kartoffel Keller looks like any other restaurant from the front. That is, until you realize that it's actually in the basement! Open the old door and be greeted with plenty of old world deco. They use waxy candles that melt over a wine bottle and by the look at the wax, they only use candle light. The ambiance is a bit dark but it's fitting. On to the food! I love potatoes. I love everything about potatoes and this restaurant specializes in potatoes! The translation of Kartoffel Keller is Potato Cellar. I went straight to the potato salads because I love German potatoes salads back home. There were types I have never seen nor heard of before so I went for the one that was that sounded the most unique. Potato salad with young herring, onions, beet root and apple slices. Everything in the salad was excellent. The sauce was a bit more watery then you'd find back home but it helped coat all the pieces nicely. The onions added a nice spicy bite. The potatoes were a little bitey which is exactly how I like them. I ordered the potato stew with sausage for the main course. It was very filling. It's served in a pot hanging over a tea light candle to keep it warm. The stew consistency was a little thin for what I would call stew, but the taste was there. There was some ground sausage in it with some cased sausage as well. Both were excellent. Since it was almost Christmas, I had to order the Gluhwein. It was very well done as well. The spices weren't over powering and it was just sweet enough to overcome the winey vapor you get from hot wine. Combine the ambiance with the food and the price, this place is a winner in my book. Next time I'm in Hamburg, you know where to find me. :)"
0,"This is a mexican restaurant?! More like a nightclub with tables! I'm seriously glad that I ate before meeting friends here. At the door there was a queue of 50 people waiting to get in, all dressed up, on the pull. It was moving at a rate of 2 people per minute. Coming from inside the restaurant was booming dance music. Ok, Ok, I was sorta expecting a bar. I wasn't expecting a meat-market club though. It's not as terrible as my 1 star rating, it's just not my kind of place, and I'll probably not be back is all"
3,A very interesting mock up of different location. we went there my friends kids 6-8 and they had a blast.
3,"Went once for the specialty/fusion sushi that is offered  awesome! So tasty and very creative. Fancy atmosphere, need to reserve in the evenings. More on the pricey side, but high-quality food."
2,"I like RehBar, the grown up more austere big brother of Aurel. Decent prices and it has a nice ambience but the place is a bit soulless. I like working there as there is free WiFi. Nice but nothing special."
1,"Wow, surprised at all the positive reviews here. Some people either have really low standards, or many of these are faked. This place was quite a disappointment. Outside of the decent sized portion of Aioli and bread to kick of the meal, everything else went downhill. I'm almost inclined to give only one star but I've had worse (directly in the area where this restaurant is!) I actually feel that most of the restaurants in the area are horrible and hence the general quality of all is drawn downwards. This place may have had it's prime but is long past it now. Our waiter didn't quite understand the concept of service. The food itself was absolutely mediocre and a day later, I have some serious indigestion from the lamb with garlic dish. Food was thrown on to the table basically when being served to us. The waiter couldn't be bothered to come to our table regularly to check on things and he really didn't care to be nice. The prices are also much too high for what you get. Finally, where I was sitting outside, right next to their entrance, it stank. There was a nasty odor coming from the ground level vent right there. Gosh I hope this wasn't coming from their kitchen. This place may have been good but no more. I'd seriously consider twice if you plan on eating there."
3,"Unless you are dining alone for weekend brunch, you need only look to the bottom of the Frühstück offerings and order the Victoria & Daniel. It pretty much has everything all of the offerings above have (combined!) and then some.Swedish pancakes, homemade applesauce, lingonberry jam, amazing homemade breads, butter, a mountain of cream cheese no one can finish, an assortment of cheeses, delicious savory and buttery mini quiches with specks of bacon, rich and extremely flavorful homemade veal liver pate, surprisingly excellent herring, hard-boiled eggs, fruit salad, and a small assortment of local veggies. Yes! You get all of that. You also get a gratis helping of ""where the heck do I start!?!"" and a glass of prosecco or orange juice as well. Skip breakfast, skip lunch, do brunch...here."
4,"To be honest, despite thinking I was sober when I arrived at this bar, looking back I was not! But what I remember is that it was really nice atmosphere, wicked decor, good drinks prices and even though we planned to move on to another bar we did not so must have been good! I also have a vague memory of spinning some sort of music wheel on the dance floor and dancing on my own. So yes, I recommend it and will definitely be going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
3,"Kardelen is an affordable Turkish place with dozens of solid meat and vegetarian options. The food tastes fresh, and there are daily vegetarian and meat options posted on a blackboard outside and showcased before the cash register behind a glass counter.I recommend the gemüseteller mit döner, which is aubergines, cauliflower, couscous, two falafel balls, yogurt sauce, and chicken or beef with a small side salad for 6.50€.The food here overall isn't amazing, but it's tasty and certainly worth the low costs. I've had a lot better döner kebab and falafel in Hamburg, but this is still a place I recommend for lunch if you're in the area."
4,"Amazing place to spend your day. Depending on how crowded it is and what you prefer to do, you can easily spend hours here. You can also only send an hour or two if that's your preference. I was with a group no one in the group had been there before. It also shares a building with a Dungeon museum as well. It's a few flights of stairs up to the ticket area and there is an elevator as well. The lines are split up into no reservations, reservations, and private tours I believe was the last one. The day we went was very very busy. When we went to buy tickets we had the option of waiting a few hours until the crowd thinned out or come back later that night. There was a store and cafeteria that also served as the waiting area I believe but we chose to come back later. I thought it paid off as it wasn't as busy later in the night. It was open until 1 am which was great but surprising. The souvenier store serves as the entrance and exit. There are tons of good toys and trinkets which I bought a few on the way out. We didn't get a chance to eat at the cafeteria but it looked like typical cafeteria food with drinks and snacks as well. The seating area, which there were tons of seats, was all old airplane seats. Mostly two seaters facing each other with tables. Cool set up. The actual museum starts with the history of the museum and how it started. They have headsets, which are in English as well, that explain the first few exhibits. The workshop areas were also here. Because of how late it was, they were all pretty empty. Once you get past that, the ""real"" part of the museum starts. Miniature set ups of all types. Sweden, USA, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and a few more I believe. There is also a working airport as well and other little random displays. If I had to use one word, mind blowing would be it. The amount of detail and the displays are amazing. There was a set up of a live out door festival which was pretty spot on, like almost everything there. The displays also change times of the day, I want to say every 15 minutes or so, so the same displays now come to life via the night. Lights turn on, headlights, street lights, etc, Many parts are also moving with a push of the button so there is tons to see whether its night or day. This is where you can send hours on each display just studying all of the little things going on. Most of the displays also have a ledge to stand on so you can lean over and see closer. This is also where big crowds here can get difficult. The working airport is one of my favorite parts. Planes of all types take off and land and gate and refuel, load, etc. It's pretty amazing. If you're a Star Wars fan, there are definitely a few references which you'll have to pay attention to spot. Definitely one of the coolest places I've been to in a very long time. I will definitely be back."
3,"Nice cozy restaurant featuring Franconian cuisine and drinks.Pros: Friendly, multi-lingual staff with English menusPet friendlyCons: Pet friendly"
3,"Good steak house. They have large fresh salads, and the garlic bread is awesome. But the steaks are lean, well prepared, and the service is good for a German restaurant - which means efficient but not overly friendly, and certainly not casual. They have some nice beers on taps, and a rather good selection of wine as well. They serve deserts, but I prefer to go to some place else like a nice coffee shop to have a pot of tea and maybe some straddle. Or to one of the awesome chocolate shops around. I eat here every time I am in Hamburg."
4,Hamburg is the SF of Europe. The harbor vibes with them dope coffee shops mang!!! Nord coast is one of the more classy joints with food on their menu. It overlooks the water and has a good amount of seating. Their lattes and espressos are on point. The cost wasn't overwhelming and their staff is very friendly. A great place to meet up with people.
3,"I very much enjoyed my visit to Golden! I was staying at a hotel down the street, and decided I had a taste for Chinese food. Seeing that there was a positively-reviewed place just a short walk away, I decided to get take away and bring it back to my room.The staff was very friendly when I arrived. After a few minutes looking over the menu, I decided on a beef dish that was supposed to be spicy. Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact name of the dish. While I waited, I looked around the restaurant itself which was clean and comfortable, if not a little dark. The food came out relatively quickly, and I walked back to my hotel. Once settled down, I ripped in to the bag and found a lot of food (for the price), and it was very delicious as well! The dish was not very spicy, which was disappointing, but I am used to that - most places are not spicy enough for me.I would certainly return to Golden if I were in the area for the friendly staff, good prices and delicious food."
3,"Great, real Austrian place. You come for the Schnitzel and you return for the Schnitzel. Authentic menu with everything you'd expect from the Austrians from Nocken via Zwetschge to Kaiserschmarn. Obviously consistently good since the place still fills up in the evenings. Make sure to reserve. The smaller schnitzel is sufficient but if you're really hungry, go for the large one. It will satisfy. Service was also super nice and you could see they all care. We went home happy and will be back, sooner than later. My favorite schnitzel is still at Casse Croute in Hamburg but this place is a very close second and literally just a smidgen less good."
4,"Great place to enjoy the view. They have good burger and their diabolo pizza is also not bad. If you came late, make sure you can find a good place. Because the beach outside is windy and cold at night, while if you stay too close to the stage inside will make the music too loud to enjoy."
4,"If you're looking for traditional northern German food, Brodersen is definitely a good spot! The interior is also traditional and cozy with a nautical theme. The Pannfisch with the Dijon mustard sauce was quite good, and my partner also really enjoyed the Rumpsteak. I think the highlight was however the Bratkartoffeln... crispy yet soft and fried to perfection! Not the cheapest restaurant but for special occasions definitely a good option! Good for tourists visiting hamburg as well."
3,Good food and good shots. Be prepared because you can end up drunk just before starting with the free shots the friendly waiters pour for you!
4,"I just like this place the beer is always cold, the music (Indie/Alternative) is always brilliant, the people around are always friendly & easy-going and the barstaff are always genuine folks. The bar itself is retro-style (orange / brown) decorated with some glamorous wallpaper :)They also got a couple of smaller rooms next to the main one equipped with loads of comfy cairs, sofas and stools. All rooms are dimly lit and so make you feel at home easily. Yet it's a smoker-friendly bar which is a disadvantage for me personally but what the heck :) As a plus you could get the chance to bump into the odd rockstar coming from Knust or Schanze. Mutter is said to be one of their fave hangouts after the show."
4,There are several of these along the S and U-Banh stations near Jungfernstieg but they are all of consistently high quality. You can't beat the value of these - particularly the jumbo curry combo. You get a whole meal for ~$4-5 USD at the current exchange rate - incredible by any measure in Europe. Service is ridiculously quick but is cash only - a problem for those of you getting by using a travel card. This place served as lunch and dinner one day when I was particularly desperate - I didn't regret it one bit.
4,"FANTASTIC! Loved it! My husband and I went there for lunch about 2 weeks ago and we were both very pleased with our pizzas. I was able to get a vegan pizza, he was able to get a meat pizza. Both of us gobbled up the whole thing."
4,Such an interesting part of Hamburg... A place where old meets new to the max. Even though it reminds me of Holland and Amsterdam a lot it has it own charm due to the new part Hafencity being add to the old Speicherstadt... Cannot wait for the Elbphilharmonie to be finished and see this area grow to a fun and interesting place. It could use some green and trees though... That is a pity... a leafy lane would work well here as contrast to both the new and the old!!!
3,"A really nice place for Sunday brunch in Hamburg.Considering its position just a stone's throw from the Rathausmarkt and Neuer Wall, it could easily use the same tactic as nearby places such as Alex at the Alsterpavillon or Mio on Jungfernstieg where the sheer number of tourists mean that they can ramp up prices and largely ignore good service.However at Melange this doesn't seem to be the case. For the equivalent of EUR10 per person for a hungry family of four we enjoyed a large range of breads, tea, hot chocolate, meats, cheeses, scrambled egg, croissants, Schwartzbrot, a glass of prosecco. Delicious!So you can sit in one of four places; either outside alongside the water (ask for blankets if you are cold), inside on the ground floor, but recommended especially on a cold day is the inside upper floor where there is a nice buzz and friendly crowd of tourists and locals plus it has a smaller outdoor balcony too. It's actually open from 9am on Sundays (earlier than many places) and from 10.30 gets really busy so expect a slight wait after this time.On the whole the staff are friendly and efficient, speak English and were very kind to our children."
4,"I really loved this place. It is cooler than probably any bar i've ever been to in london and it was really cheap with really friendly fast service. The best bit about it is that you can play extreme table football in the back and then when you're tired head into the bedroom for a quick snooze. There's even a blanket, and no one seems to mind if you do sleep, unlike london where you can get chucked out of a club for closing your eyes. Very chilled and very nice."
1,"They have a great happy hour deal: 3,50 for jumbo sized cocktails. But the food is disappointing. Not only is it grossly overpriced, but the quality doesn't even remotely justify it. We had to send back some buffalo wings that weren't cooked through. My burrito tasted like a wet sponge. My meal was bland and strange. Nothing had flavor except the salad dressing (which I regretfully discovered too late as a potential flavor enhancer). I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the Americas, from lavishly expensive to hole-in-the-wall family operations. Most all of them were splendid. Mexican food is actually very hard to screw up. But either I was mistaken and Sausalitos is not a Mexican restaurant, or like other Mexican restaurants in Germany it suffers the same curse German restaurants do in America: only still in business by virtue of their novelty. Service:People skills were sorely lacking. I got my coffee with a creamer that turned out to be empty; it had been reclosed, likely by the patron who whitened his or coffee with it earlier that day. The server was in no way apologetic or surprised by that. It also tells me something about what the restaurant does to save money when clearing tables: scavenging peoples dishes for reusable items. Disgusting!!! I won't eat there again. But I might go for cocktails (though to be honest, they weren't very good either.)"
4,"Oh my gosh, I love this place so much.My husband and I are huge ramen fans, and this place never disappoints. We've been to several ramen restaurants in Düsseldorf, and Zipang may even be an inch above those. We usually get gyoza to start, which is perfectly cooked with a flavorful filling. The miso ramen is my go-to choice, and it's always perfect the way it is. I love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the broth is so tasty. Mochi is a must for dessert. They sometimes switch up the flavors which is nice. I've had chocolate, vanilla, green tea, and black sesame. It can definitely get crowded in here, but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a seat. The outdoor seating is nice in the summer, and I like the Japanese style of the indoor seating. Definitely looking forward to exploring the menu more and coming again and again!"
2,i tasted the pho ga and the bun bo. what can i say... it was decent food but nothing that really excited me.
4,Great Vietnamese street food style restaurant with a cool vibe! Definitely try the Vietnamese ice coffee. Ask for the spicy vinegar if you need a bit more tang. Recommended!
4,"Good coffee, good bagel. Supposedly one of the best coffees in town.. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but thought it was delicious. Attentive wait staff, comfortable seating. Recommend!"
4,"I am a HUGE fan of ramen so when this place came up as a new business in Hamburg on my feed, I couldn't resist going there for dinner and checking it out. I wasn't disappointed!This place is already uber popular! I got there about 6:30 and there was already a queue waiting to sit. Ended up waiting about 20 mins to get in and this was a Tuesday evening. I can't imagine what the wait must be on weekends. Worth knowing: if you arrive and there's a queue, you still need to go in and put your name down on the waiting list. Even when I left round 20:30, there was still a queue!I got edamame beans to start off with. They were well salted and tasty. The portion is huge for a starter. I would say these are enough beans for 3 . Next I got the Nitamago Wakame Miso Ramen. They have 3 bases on offer for their ramen: miso, shoyu and shio. They also all come with certain toppings; viewable on the menu and the difference between them tends to lie in the additional toppings. I was glad that they include a naruto on it; gives good colour and naruto is quite tasty.The best part of a ramen to me is the soup base and this base was amazing. Not as spicy(chilli) as I would have liked but this is something I've slowly finally come to grips with in Germany; I find the average spicy level here less than mild. Thankfully they provide additional chili to add, its called house spice  and is essentially a chilli oil. With the right amount of this added, the base was just right. Soft noodles and good portions of vegetables rounded it all up. Awesome ramen! This may just be one of my new favorite spots in hamburg. I'll absolutely be back"
3,"Great food, very limited seating options. Expect to queue for a seat around lunchtime. The real menu is scribbled in chalk on various blackboards situated around the restaurant."
4,"Tiny and cramped Indian restaurant with self service in the middle of Hamburg. The food is excellent at such a cheap price point, it's unbelievable. Definelty check it out if you love authentic Indian cuisine. Many vegetarian options available as well and their Mango Lassi is amazing."
4,"It's like have your personal chef. If you are in Hamburg this is the place. Excellent service, excellent food!"
3,Found this charming place (by smell) on the way to the Warehouse district. I was SO bummed that I wasn't able to snag an English tour.  Why isn't this place on the trip advisor list - it's a total must do!  Who doesn't want a chocolate tour?!!! The shop is FULL of delicious chocolates made in-house and from around the world.  Definitely pick up some decadent chocolates! The ladies at the register are darling.
3,I don't know much about Vietnamese food and how it is supposed to taste. But I can tell you that this restaurant offers tasty food in a relaxed atmosphere. The staff is friendly even though sometimes a bit odd (not in a rude way).
2,"I found this lovely little place by posting a question on the Yelp Hamburg page as I was looking for somewhere that did a high tea sort of spread in Germany.We travelled for over an hour and it took a while to find the place but I was so glad we made the effort.We arrived mid morning and as we were really hungry we got tea, breakfast and I had a scone. The breakfast itself was something I'm not used to simply because of the combination of food that we got. I did find it to be the norm in Germany though with slight variations, the plate had fruit, a warm hard boiled egg, some jam, fresh tomato and a very crunchy but yummy roll. We had English breakfast tea which was tasty. I'm not a cream person so I only had jam on my scone but it was nice.The building itself was old and very old fashioned with lots of pictures of the queen. Had a very British feel and it was lovely. Staff although friendly were very hard to find when you wanted them and I had to go looking when I wanted to order scones and when I wanted to pay.I will definitely go back next time I'm in Hamburg as we had a very enjoyable day.Had I not had to chase staff it would have got 4 stars for sure and I would still recommend this place if you want something old fashioned with a bit of charm and an English feel."
3,"Just in terms of the art of plating, this restaurant is easily in the top 10 of all time that I have ever dined at or experienced. Every dish was exceptionally photo-worthy, from multiple angles, and literally compelled you to take out your smartphone and photograph it. Simply put, our dinner was art on a plate. The food here also had many different flavor profiles and flavor combinations that would test the range of many people's palettes. The cuisine is French-Moroccan. Some could easily find it odd or mis-matched. I appreciated it because it was something new and often had me saying ""hmmm...interesting...good, but very different.""Seven courses per person were a bit on the pricey side -- moths flew out of my wallet after I paid the bill -- but it was a wonderful celebration dinner that night, all in all, for multiple reasons.If you really want to taste something a little bit different, bold, new or refreshing, where the food is beautifully plated, then this is the place."
4,"I might have found a new favorite coffee place in Hamburg! They seem to roast their own coffee and it actually tastes really good. We had an Americano and a Cappuccino. Both tasted aromatic. Their waffles are famous, so we had to try one with Nutella and were not disappointed! Their cheesecakes are very good as well! I almost liked it more than their waffles. It's a nice place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon with friends and family."
3,"Honestly some of the best Pho Soup and Noodles I have had outside the United States.  The restaurant, though very well located in the innerStadt, was small and very crowded for lunch.  Being a very cold March day in Hamburg having the door open and close at our backs was a bit uncomfortable, but the hot soups and tea mostly made up for it. One can tell that this is a family restaurant.  The service was very nice and fast.  If you are looking for a warm quick lunch this would be my #2 suggestion for Hamburg.  Guess I will have to make a new list!We ordered two green teas, which got cold rather quickly because they are served in bowls, but by the time they were too cold the soup and noodles were there.  I ordered #15, which was viggies in noodles, always one of my favorites. My friend ordered Pho with Shrimp.  We shared the spring rolls which I could tell were made and fried fresh, not frozen.Looking forward to a follow up lunch at Quan do!"
3,Great food.  The staff was friendly and the food was on point. Decent wifi which was extremely necessary during my vacation. Cocktails were perfect.
2,"Bei derriesigen Auswahl an asiatischen Essensmöglichkeiten bietet dieser BOK imUnterscheid zu vielen anderen, auch derselben Kette, doch wirklich ein gutesNiveau. Essen und Preis stehen im korrekten Verhältnis, verstehe auch nichtdiesen Hype, dass in Deutschland immer alles so heiß gegessen werden muss.Gemüse ist frisch, Tofu hat Geschmack, und ich mag die Atmosphäre."
3,Really good wholesome meal. Plenty of home grown German options to choose from. Always feel slightly uncomfortable with the staff- may be my issue since I don't speak fluent German. Sit where you want which is nice. Nice spacious restaurant and they have their own beer selection.
0,"Sub-par food at high prices, snobby owners more interested in joking around than dealing with the customers queuing. To me, this is another one of the many operations riding the vegan trend for maximum cash and giving the vegan movement a bad rep."
3,Bored on Sunday night and want to drink till 4am with loads of old people instead of thinking about work? Here's your venue!
3,Nice amusement if you want to kill some time on a rainy day. Very fair ticket prices.
2,"Depending upon when you go, Mutter varies a lot. On the weekend it'll be so rammed that you can hardly get through the door and it'll be smokey as hell - the smoking ban does not apply here. However, when it's not so busy it's alright in here. It's never going to be my favourite bar, but I had a nice enough time here."
4,"By reputation it's the best Italian restaurant in Hamburg. I have to agree. Great food, good service, feels authentic and costs an arm and a leg. Looks a bit ropey, and is nestled between all the working girls of Davidstrasse. Apparently it's been here for many decades, long may it continue.Book early if you want to go on the weekend."
2,"If nine floors of model ships floats your boat, you'll love this museum. If not, I'd give it a miss."
2,Das Essen hier ist wirklich lecker. Pakistanisch und Indisch sind nicht besonders unterschiedlich. Beim Mittagstisch gebennsie sich allerdings nicht die allergrößte Mühe. Schmeckt trotzdem immernoch gut. Die Bedienung ist mal so mal so. Gehe hier aber dennoch gern hin.
3,"Fine cup of coffee - and such friendly service. Its a bit scruffy, but in a nice way. My son had a truly fresh mint tea = hot water + mintstick with leaves. Thats the best way to make a mint tea - love it. They also serve a fresh ginger tea. I would do that if I happened to come by again."
2,"If u r searching for a good cocktail bar, it's what u r looking for. Awesome atmosphere and nice drinks! But the food isn't so tasty. Good thing is they offer gluten free meals! I'll say better to go there as a bar rather than restaurant."
2,"Not a lot of mexican places in Hamburg.   We went here searching for a fix.Overall service was good.  There is English menu included.   The menu is very simple; 2 pages for food.  More pages for alcohol.   We started with guacamole and it was good.  Hubby thought it was a little too Limey but he was eating every bit of it.  And it seemed homemade.  We had a lime margarita and mango margarita.  For price, it was pretty small but it tasted pretty good, maybe too much tequila (not exactly a bad thing).  Kids had cold milk.   My hubby asked for true mexican beer (dos Equis Amber, negro modelo which were on menu) but they were out.  They did have corona and German beer.The kids has the burrito with queso.  Considering the price and 3 tortillas, we had them split.  The tortillas were small, corn, and ultimately not a very large serving.  It also was covered in salsa.I had burrito with chicken with green salsa.  Overall it was good but was made with corn tortillas and small.  Taste was good though.   Hubby had enchiladas with beef and mole.   Again corn (more expected) and he was happy with mole.We ended dinner with their only dessert which was plantains in honey and cream. It was ok....  Not my thing.Considering the choices, it was okay for our fix.  Guacamole and a margarita were my favorites.    Also there weren't a lot of people there on a Saturday night.  Btw, they open at 6pm and hard to park."
0,"As group of 3, made is wait about an hour for course number 2. Reacted very unfriendly and harsh when called out. Food is good though..."
3,"Wow, what a great place! I headed straight here the first time I was in Hamburg when it actually didn't rain! Walking up through the hustle and bustle of the riverside past the harbour, I really wasn't sure what to expect, and was pleased to find this place with a nice level of busy-ness (i.e. plenty of different seating options and not vast queues to the bar, but still a good vibe and lots of people from all age ranges). The imported sand is soft, although it could have been cleaner. The music is funky-chill-out - something I'd hate normally but seemed to fit the place well. I didn't eat but the food (pizzas, burgers, salads) looked fresh and big portions. A perfect way to spend a hot and lazy afternoon in Hamburg, watching the big ships sail past and catching up with friends."
3,"Huge variety of dishes (kebab, falafel)Cheap price - 4 euro for doner.Popular with locals,  not much space to sit inside. Fast service, friendly stuff.You cannot pay by card."
3,"I became a fan of Thai food last year on a stay in the US...since then I really love Thai food and - of course - this was the reason to look out for Thai restaurants while on a short trip to Hamburg.I found Sala Thai Hafencity while walking around this beautiful part of the city - and went in for lunch. First: The place looks super. Very clean, nicely decorated and a fantastic view! The food I had was very good - a soup and hot chili beef. The slightly sour soup was very different from many other soups I had in Thai places...And the beef was very delicious though VERY hot. I am really accustomed to eating hotter than most other people...but that was almost too hot. So watch out when the menu says ""hot""! Service was great. Never disturbing, always nice...just like it's supposed to be. And the price was absolutely fine for what I got (might be different in the evening, though). To sum up: When I'm in Hamburg again I will visit Sala Thai again. This is a place I can recommend without hesitating."
2,"Soup (mizo) and sushi were OK, but I wouldn't necessarily come back for them.Service was sparse, staff was friendly but not paying much attention. Asked for extra rice but never got it."
0,"Service was from a young man who couldn't speak any German and who's English was very difficult to understand. Jumbo plate was good, obviously basic but what was expected.Red blue and white burger was gross. Way too much blue cheese - unbalanced flavors. Soggy buns. The patty was sub-par as well. Have had a lot of blue cheese burgers in the last year so I know a gross burger when I taste it.Macaroni and cheese tasted artificial and was too strong.To sum it up: the food at Hard Rock Cafe is dated. The times have changed and both the rest of the world and Germany have gotten very good at food and flavor. Hard rock cafes food no longer has that extra something - it has been overtaken by amazing alternatives!"
2,From 1 (worst) to 5 (best)Food taste: 3 Good.Food variety: 4 Many.Price: 3 ModerateMobility: 5 Easy by public and private transport. Recommendation and comment:Many would find the taste is good.
3,"If you're looking for something a little more upscale that won't break the bank, this is definitely a great spot to go. Was here for a company outing dinner and really enjoyed it. The menu is quite diverse and they have an excellent selection of Flammkuechen, fish dishes and burgers. There's definitely something on the menu for everyone. I had the ""Fisch Platte"" that was a whitefish, salmon and shrimp scampi (unfortuately cold) -- came with Bratkartoffeln and a small salad. Huge portion but all of it very tasty. A colleague got a burger and he also enjoyed this. It's an old warehouse type space renovated with a large dining hall and smaller rooms off to the sides, seems like a great place for a group to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. To top it off, there is a real ""Trude"" in the back lawn! Massive!"
4,"Even if it seems that there is a lot of people waiting in front of the restaurant, you won't wait for a long time as the waiters and the cooks are fast and friendly, which is really convenient when it is your lunch break. I took a döner in a flatbread (for just 4,50€) and I really had enough even though I didn't take any side. You can either consume on the spot or take away your food, which is appreciable."
3,"Busy little Mexican bistro but inviting to step inside! Menu options are basic but have all the necessary ingredients to get your Mexican taste buds watering. The only thing missing at a glance was fish tacos or a shrimp option. Otherwise it seemed that the more simple the better!They offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. You can order veggie, vegan, tofu, chicken, steak, beef, or even chorizo fillers/toppings along with a variety of typical sides such as rice, beans, cheeses & several sauces. There is a sign that states: If we do not serve you within 10min, you'll be served in 15-20min, we are doing the BEST we can!!! Fair enough, but even with such a warning, the smells and your hunger wear down your patience as you sit feeling famished and eager to eat! The service is so friendly one does not complain, but when your food finally comes to the table, you dig right in!!! The portions are huge and the burritos are fresh & tasty :-) It reminds me of a German version of the U.S chain, Chipotle but without seeming sooo franchisey (I made up that word just now) Order a side of sour cream & salsa then enjoy!!!"
3,"Tiny little fish place. I had a mixed plate that was quite tasty. It's very ""mom and pop"" with just one lady doing all the work. Beware you will smell like fried fish if you dine in. Great for a light meal (by German standards!) and quick too, they also have takeaway options too."
4,"We both ordered a ""Mars Menu"": (I) pulpo salad (II) chicken with mashed potatoes (III) vanilla ice-cream with strawberries. All for Euro 38 per person. It was excellent and the portions were quite large. We sat at the bar and the service was very professional and friendly. The noise level was high but this well reflected the good atmosphere of the staff and guests. We will certainly return here again in the future."
4,"This place is suburb!  We were trudging back to our hotel after 5 hours on our feet. We would have eaten anywhere!  I thought it was just going to be a run-of-the-mill cafe. It is so much more!  My husband had, what he now considers, one of the best dishes in his life!  He ordered a linguine with cherry tomatoes, onions, steak in a Parmesan cream sauce. I loved my dish also, pappardelle (obviously homemade) with crab and large shrimp in a saffron based sauce. Terrific!  Also they delivered a wonderful amuse bouche of a small bowl of a cauliflower soup that was fantastic.  This place is out if the way, but out of this world. ( it was around 44 euro for two entrees and two drinks)"
4,"I go to Jim Burrito at least once a month and I've never been disappointed with the food!Now that they reorganised the restaurant the service is even quicker. The decoration and the atmosphere are great, the music is cool (often rock).Huge pro: They have 3 menus- omnivorous- vegetarian- veganI recommend the quesadillas (served with guaca, sour cream, salsa and salad) or burritos if you are reeeeeaaally hungry"
3,Cool and stylish with prices to match. Always a relaxed atmosphere - a decent place to catch up with friends.
3,One of my favourite bars on the Reeps. great cocktails. try a St Pauli Killer.
3,"I visit green lovers every few weeks for a salad lunch. They have a handful of predetermined salad recipes to choose from, or you can choose your own adventure with several dozen salad toppings available. They also serve some soups and curries, and a handful of sandwich options. My favorite salad is the Nordisch by Nature, which includes cucumbers, radishes, spring onions, and smoked salmon over lettuce, with a creamy yogurt dressing and a sprinkle of mustard sauce. I've also tried the chicken sesame salad, which was okay but not great. All of the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared, and the staff is friendly. If you get there at peak lunch time (12:30-1:00), there will probably be a queue of 5-10 people waiting to place their orders, but things move pretty quickly, and you can order salads to eat in or take away."
4,"Excellent customer service, great wine selection. Altogether pleasurable dining experience"
3,"The food here was pretty good, the service was decent, and the building itself was pretty cool to look at. The salmon was pretty good. It wasn't amazing, but it was one of the better ones I've had in Hamburg. The meatball was tender and juicy. Very good. The side salads were also very good, as was the sweet mustard that came with both the salmon and the meatball. The starter we got (a traditional German dish of ground of herring - I can't remember the name) I didn't find particularly good, but the person I was with enjoyed it."
3,Some London bars should visit this place to learn about customer service!! This was my first experience of a Hamburg bar and I was impressed by the welcome I received. The manager 'Patrick' greeted me like a local and ushered me to a table whilst he fetched the drinks (no jostling for the bar mans attention required - Fantastic!!) Initially I was a bit sceptical of the music and atmosphere in the bar as loud 80's music was being belted out by the DJ and crowds of men were merrily singing along and dancing (??) however I found myself quickly getting into the swing of things and before I knew it I was joining in with my new 'friends'. (vodka induced?)Patrick then introduced me to the bars 'secret shot' and again I was impressed (not to mention shocked) as the shot was delicious and tasted of strawberries and cream!!This place made me smile - I will be back!
4,"I see a lot of zoo in europe but this is my favourite! Animals live in large spaces and a lot of them could feel freedom in thepark. Indeed while u're visiting the zoo, u could bump into peacoaks, pelicans or goats and other cute animals. There are a lot of cute puppies that borned in zoo. This zoo has a secret..  At the entrance there a stand where some people give u a bag of vegetables. Here it's allowed visitors to tAke care of animals (surely vegeterian ones) and feed them. To take an example, u could touch elephants and give them beetroot! They love it!!"
4,"Yet another review to chime in, go if you can. Just remember to be patient. I am not a miniature person but the details really draw you in! Especially the little jokes and punch lines by pressing a button and hunting for the displays. There really was a lot of work and passion put into this wonderland, and that alone impressed me. Those people are truly the geek gods of Hamburg, if little else. Respect!"
2,"I went to this coffee shop yesterday super excited after I saw their amazing tools( grinder, aero press, roasting their own beans etc.). I assumed it would be an amazing coffee shop and even brought my sister and boyfriend to show them the great location I found while visiting Hamburg. When we went to order our coffees I learned that they don't carry any non dairy milk which disappointed me a lot. Seeing vegan food options on the menu made me believe they for sure would carry non dairy milk but I was wrong. I passed on my coffee order after making the barrister aware I can't have milk and was offered a chai latte or tea. Button line is...carrying vegan food options but no non dairy milk was pretty disappointing to me."
0,"Did this Place shut down ? I can not reach anyone by Phone ( the Number you have dialed is unavailable ""040 43183050"" and the Website ist down and Domain for Sale !Does anyone know more about this ?"
4,"Wonderful Wonderland, we love going there. Even though it is very crowded and one needs a lot of patience, it is always a great joy. Especially the airport is so exciting, we could have spent hours there!We booked our visit in combination with a harbour boat tour and the Wunderland was open until 1 or 2 am. I'm not sure if they do that regularly though. So the later it was the more people left and we actually had some space and could enjoy everything.We will go again!!!"
2,"You really feel like you are on the beach. Wonderful but it remembers a bit on a package tour. Over all the prices. Too expensive. And going to the toilet costs extra.But the excuse is good: The view, the sand.. the summerfeeling."
1,"Cool ambience place that was full, people were in a waiting list for tables.Thank goodness I just wanted to pick up some take away.I had to wait forever for a menu since the waitress that wanted to get me one just disappeared. After searching for another waitress I got one.I asked for a Bacon Burger with double patty and asked for it to be rare. They told me they only do medium. Since that always means it's dreadfully overcook I asked for it to be as rare as they can possibly do it. I also ordered chili cheese fries for over 6 euros and an Oreo shake for 5 euros and 2 dips.After a while I received my food and went home:A dip was missing. The very very expensive chili cheese fries were literally a small portion of normal fries with a tiny cheese dip on the side (over 6 euros!).And of course, the burgers were dreadfully overcooked. All grey & dry. Meat densely pressed together, not a single trace of anything even remotely pinkish. (While waiting for my food I have seen some burgers with pink Centers being medium, still not rare enough).The shake was VERY tasty. It was really really good. But the price of 5 euros for the small amount is not justified at all. The price of the ridiculous fries took the cake.Always looking for good burger places this place showed potential but disappointed with extreme prices for deceiving product and tough meat that was pressed too hard. Ground meat needs to be fluffier.My 25 Euro tab was just disappointing, considering I did not even get one of my tiny 2 Euro dips."
3,"Considering it was a miserable, rainy day with high windgusts -- This was still a gorgeous area to dine. It would have been nicer on the terrace, but the interior is very modern and nice.I couldn't forget the Sweet Curry Coconut Chicken Wok (Chicken, Mango/Coconut Curry, Tomatoes, Grapes)  if I wanted to. It was decently priced and extremely tasty. I was suprised and very pleased."
4,"Great Greek restaurant. We walked into the restaurant at midnight on a Saturday night. It was still opened until 2am. The waiter was not so nice but I can understand given the time. For only 12€50, I've got a big plate with pork Souflaki, tzatziki, gyros and fries. They even offered us a salad in entrance. The flavors reminded me when I was in Greece few years ago, so good job!"
3,Great atmosphere. Fresh food. Good service. Bustling. Reservations recommended but helpful to get seated if not. Smaller menu selection. Menu changed weekly.
2,"Disappointing for an Aussie who had hoped for a more healthy version like back home. Also the burrito couldn't be picked up due to size and how runny the insides were. Slow service (only one guy in the kitchen during lunchtime!) but I'm getting used to that in Germany. They mean well and seem nice & friendly but kinda missed the mark for me. Maybe I try the quesadilla next time, most people seemed to order that."
3,"something nostalgic and very Japanese about this place. I figured out after donkeys ears of going to this joint that there is even a karaoke section somewhere in the cellar. you'll find groups of Japanese MIBs in the neighbouring tables which probably means it's not a japeusch concoction their delivering. daruma comes from the Indian word dharma btw. dharma as in dharmic religions Hinduism, Buddhism etc.  it also stands for the cute red paper figure lining the top shelves of this place. albeit a bit dusty. I suspect they haven't been dusted since the 70s. which is also the look and feel of the place BTW. recommend going here for an authentic Japanese experience with a hospitable Japanese family. the man cooks, the woman waits."
4,"The ""transparent bakery"" (Gläserne Bäckerei) is a bakery located conveniently next to ""Planten und Blomen"" (plantenunblomen.hamburg.… ) and the Dammtor train station. It is run by Effenberger (effenberger-vollkornbaec… ) and offers a selection of freshly baked and often still warm delicious organic whole-grain bread. You can observe the whole process and have a chat with the baker in charge. A fun place, also for children."
4,"Delicious! Great environment, friendly staff, and delicious ice cream- all for a great price!!! They also have vegan options. Would highly recommend!"
3,The restaurant wears a pleasant atmosphere with nice aroma everywhere. I had pasta which i think was the best i had till date.
4,I simply love it! The best pizza in town! Friendly service and great prices! My favorite party-italian:-)
3,It was good. Price was good. Service very friendly.  Location is convenient right by the train station.
2,"""Otto's'"" seem to be the only place in Hamburg currently serving ""Beyond Meat"" (The Impossible Burger, a competitor, isn't being served anywhere), vegetarian patties supposedly closely resembling meat texture and flavor.This is why I came here.Didn't enjoy Otto's ambiance too much: flickering neon lights, cold tiles, carefully run-down walls, bathrooms in a dark cellar ... all horror flick style. Most seats are hard and don't have backrests. Not cheap either (although, Germany take note, water ... is free and proactively offered.)- Drum roll -  my verdict on the Beyond Meat burger.The pessimist's take:This is, clearly, not beef. Too soft, and I can tell that this is not meat. If Beyond Meat is at version 1, wait for version 5.Mind you, I knew I was not having meat.So the optimist's take:I think that 95% of people would *not* have complained had they thought they'd be served a super-tender special-seasoning beef burger. Given that the burger's sauces and other flavors overlay much else, it would work. And it was not bad, better than any vegetarian burger I ever had.I am a carnivore, but hope that one day food like this can replace much of the cruelty of today's food chain. What a sad irony that this plant burger alternative currently costs 50% more than conventional beef.(Note: the 3*** rating isn't for this rather peculiar burger, but for place, ambiance, and its price-experience ratio in general.)"
2,"Ciu bar has a lovely location next to the Alster, and it's nicely decorated and serves good drinks, but it's not my kind of bar. It's relatively expensive. It's a bit too shiny. All the customers there look like they earn much more than me and are happy to flaunt it. Yeah, it's just not my kind of place on first impressions. Maybe I'll give it a second chance sometime though."
3,"If you want to try out some authentic mexican food and drink way too much Tequila then this is the place to come. I had an enchilada like never before. Cocoa sauce, which sounds odd but is actually pretty delicious. The staff were pretty attentive dashing back and forth with the lime, salt, tequila and san miguel. A good place to have a works party as it's going to be pretty quiet midweek, and so you can take over the bar. With my recently discovered love of burritos, it made me one step closer to believing that the best cuisine and venues are mexican. Will be going back to see what the burritos are like."
3,"The Rathaus is a pretty magnificent building right in the heart of Hamburg. You can just wander in off the street. Definitely a must see for visitors to the city, shame I don't know much about the place other than it's impressive. My only niggle with the place is the current exhibition they're running; although I personally don't have anything against it, I think perhaps it's a bit overt for children? So maybe if you're there as a family you might want to check it out before taking them in."
4,"I wanted to eat something other than train station food on my short layover in Hamburg. So Batman was a nice surprise as it was only about a 5 minute walk from the station. I had the Dönor Dürüm for €3.90. It was big, filling, fresh, and really good. Considering I went through Hamburg on trains multiple times during my travels in Europe, I had to stop here every time I came thru."
1,Very expensive for average food. Feels a bit snobby. Waiters are busy but friendly. They politely resolved a mistake on our bill (5x Moscow Mules instead of 3x) without questions asked. However I'd rather spend that much money somewhere else.
2,"Es ist ok, overall. I'm from California and have consumed countless burritos in the States...from the States that really matter when it comes to Mexican cuisine. (I've also been to Mexico a few times.)How does the food here compare? It's not too bad...really. The flavors were ok...maybe just lacking that delicious and dirty pig-fat flavoring from the grill. I enjoyed the burrito much more than the ""enchilada"" as the burrito was prepared much more like how they should be.Service was very friendly and the decor and atmosphere actually felt very SoCal-ish...think La Lucha Libre in SD, but less pink and gaudy and more punk."
4,"I just loved the atmosphere here. It was very full but the service was great and the hearty food hit the spot. I wanted to linger and take in the interesting surroundings of the old apothecary shop. I'll put this at the top of my visit list next time I'm in Hamburg. Give it a try. It bistro style,not flashy, but honest and enjoyable."
3,What a lovely place.Excellent price value ratio!!We had seafood only!Catch of the day was wonderful.Some very good wines from Portugal and Spain. Quick and friendly service!Location in the heartbeat of Hamburg (Schanze)
3,"Dubara is apparently ""the best kebab shop in Hamburg"". This is more of a folk-lore thing amongst my friends then an official claim, but of course, I had to test this theory out. OK - I have to be honest here, due to the baffling popularity of doner in continental europe, you're never going to get quite a good a kebab in France/Germany/Holland etc. as you will down the curry mile in Caspian's, Manchester (check out the reviews!!), but this place isn't bad at all. They do a special with coated nan with some sort of pizza sauce, all wrapped cylindrically, so you can eat it length-ways. This is important as any kebab-lover can attest. This monster will set you back EUR 3.70, although there are cheaper options, including a kebab with chips actually in it. I must try this. They also sell beer as everywhere here, and the staff are funny, so give it a go."
3,"Very nice and reasonable food in a casual set up, but a little small for big groups. The service was nice, the people are really nice but do not understand any language other than german so for tourists it is a little harder but pointing out what you want is never a problem. Very good for vegetarians."
0,Politely asking for my lamb to be cooked a bit more and then getting it back microwaved...
4,"What a lovely restaurant. The server/owner was delightful, warm, charming, witty, and welcoming. Phenomenal service. Fantastic chef/owner. Food was outstanding. Perfectly executed. Delicious. Would return in a heartbeat and with great pleasure. Highly recommended!"
0,"The building and the menu led us to Wasserschloss.  Made a reservation.  They didn't have the reservation but they made room for us.  That's when it all went badly.  Our server forgot to bring us bread, forgot to bring us wine, forgot to check on us once, and was surprised that we wanted the check so soon.  Terrible service ruined what could have been a great night to remember.  Stay away unless you want ok food with bland memories."
3,Recently vastly improved Italian restaurant. Al fresco dining at a reasonable price.
4,"""Hipster coffee place"" has become to mean something different to me. Instead of meaning "" pretentious "" it became to me a sign of ""quality"" . Now I see it as those people are crazy passionate for coffee. Non hipster places often would have quality depending on who is working today. But this place is true hipster. It is always a good expresso no matter who is working today."
2,"We went to The Bird with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. We ordered drinks, burgers and fries. Then, the waitress told us that they were out of fries. It was 8pm and she waited to tell us after our drinks were served, so we couldn't leave. We waited around one hour to get our dishes, and our drinks were almost empty when the burgers arrived. Our meat was a little bit overcooked but the burgers were still tasty. I think that they are the only restaurant making burger with the ""rare cooking"" authorization, which confirms the quality of the meat."
4,Great experience and great food. Would recommend. Get the tasting menu! Reasonable compared to other places. Not pretentious.
3,"Passing by one Sunday night, I saw the sign outside for Irish music night.  I'm a sucker for any chance of hearing a fiddle, so I popped in, wandered through the upstairs, and found my way down to the basement bar.What I found there was better than I'd possibly imagined --- 15 people with fiddles, pipes, Irish Bodhran drums, guitars --- I even saw a bass leaned against a wall, but not in use.  Good rollicking jigs, and several hours of them.  All instrumentals, which suited me fine.At one point I figured the only way to tell which country I was in was to listen to the two older guys having a loud conversation instead of listening --- and notice they were speaking German.Upstairs is fairly standard ""Irish pub"" look, but the basement decor's a bit odd --- the plaster is painted like huge wood beams and stone walls with ""windows"" opening out on blacklight-illuminated fantasy scenes.  One section of the wall has a sea god who belongs airbrushed on the side of a van.  Very odd.Food, eh?  The Guinness was excellent (though a half-liter instead of a pint), and the fish and chips was much better than I'd expected --- I'd rate it as a good but not excellent chippy.  I'll have to go try something meat-pie-ish, as that's a better way to judge the kitchen.The food was good, the beer was good, and the music was amazing --- I know for sure what I'm doing next time I'm in Hamburg on a Sunday."
4,This is probably the best place for tasty food and amazing cakes in the world! You really need to try the hot cocoa!
4,The best Crepes I've ever had (both savory and sweet) and the friendliest service of any place in Europe.
4,Simply stated- the best service in Hamburg. Always a friendly and accommodating staff and the food is consistently very good.
4,"This is a MUST for anyone visiting Hamburg!The Speicherstadt is the largest warehouse district in the world, it's right by the harbour and the buildings are all built along various canals. Wares used to be brought here straight from the large ships and stored in the warehouses. There's still some trade going on here obviously, but there are also many quirky and interesting places to visit, including several museums and some renouned restaurants.This district was built in the late 1800s and rests on a timber foundation. If you stay long enough to catch dusk, it's simply gorgeous to wander around on the plethora of small bridges and canals. Well-placed lighting bathes the buildings and waterways in beautiful light.It's a really photogenic district with so many museums, restaurants and other interesting places, it might be worth just wandering around and seeing what you can discover."
4,This place never fails to deliver amazing authentic Indian food. Great samosas. The dip that comes with the samosas are delicious. Their food has just the right amount of spice. Good portions with very reasonable prices.
3,"Sundays around here don't have much too offer. Being first to wait had its merits though, because this place got packed fast.I had a L'envie with a cafe au lait. The crepe was ridiculously tasty. The cheese and ham tucked into the crepe with spinach and onion jam for toppings, then top it off with a dip into the egg yolk. Savory and delicious!The owner is French, but the staff regularly converse in German. English menus are a bit outdated in pricing at this point. Seating on two levels, bathrooms are on the second level too. Sadly if they catch on that you're from the US, they will push for an American sized tip."
4,"I was deeply impressed by the super friendly staff and excellent service. Upon arrival you are greeted by a friendly waiter who takes your jacket and hangs it for you in a separate closet. Even though the bar was packed and they were short by one waiter, they managed to handle the situation in a speedy, friendly and professional way. The drinks were delicious and you can SMOKE! Thanks to the additional ventilation, the air is not too stuffy! Love it! Our waiter Jan was brilliant! He took really good care of us and all the other guests! Another advantage: The bar is open until late!"
3,"I've come to Burgerlich several times now with coworkers, family and friends. Generally, it's a good experience. There have been a few times where it wasn't so great, i.e. bathrooms not being kept clean, toilet paper strewn about in the upstairs hall and undercooked meatballs served to my child. Although, upon letting someone know, it was quickly taken care of.The ability to order via the tablet apps makes for a speedy food delivery to your table. I love the chili burger but I find that the meals are quite pricey in comparison to other burger locations nearby. Envious of the recipe for the chili mayo, it's so delicious!!!Highly recommend trying the homemade drinks. My personal go-to is the Basilikum Lemonade."
4,Authentic Cantonese food!   Large selection.   We enjoyed both the Dim Sum and dinner dishes.    The Kung Pao Shrimp was especially good.
4,wie immer sehr fleischig!
2,We went there as a small group. The place has a nice decor. They serve typical German food. The food is good but I didn't find it great. May be it was not their night. I need to be back there once more.
4,"Awesome German food! A few nice Schnitzels to choose from (incl. a beer crust and a pretzel-breaded Schnitzel), as well as other pasta and meat specialties. Nice high-class brewery atmosphere  speaking of which, their beer is excellent. Fair prices as well, and a very central location. Friendly waitstaff. One of my favorite German food places in Hamburg!"
3,"I thought this place was called Lahmacun, but I guess the sign also says Deniz Imbiss.. Anyway it's a pretty decent little kebab shop, I think - I was pretty drunk at the time I ate here."
4,"Decided to come here for Sunday brunch while visiting Hamburg based on other reviews. It didn't disappoint! The breakfast offerings are outside of your traditional German (of course) but are superior in my opinion. Large portions, plenty of flavor, lots of choices. We were able to get seating immediately (lucky) around 1100. The service was relatively quick and the staff was very friendly. Prices were extremely reasonable and the two of us ate for under 20€. There was a mix of clientele; this restaurant is not just for Turkish or Arabic people. I recommend picking up a variety of the baklava and other sweets on your way out as well. I will be back if I'm ever in the area again!"
3,"Ate here when the vegan restaurant Froindlich was too full and they recommended Xich Lô. There were plenty of vegan options and I loved the red curry. Another table nearby ordered something interesting with dry ice coming from the meal-- looked amazing. -1 star because the still water was not my favorite. I think it has a lot of minerals so it might be healthier, but it just tasted really bad to me. Also the dessert portion was a bit small.  Overall a wonderful spot, fast service and would recommend for vegans."
4,"This place is well worth a visit if you are in Hamburg and fancy some nice beer, in a lovely setting along with really good food too.We visited in December and the decorations on the brewing kit (yes they brew their own beer here!) and the rest of the restaurant was lovely.Menus are also in English and the food is typical German fayre done very well. Definitely try this place out."
4,"The best bar on Hamburger Berg- Rosis is similar to many of the other ""dive"" bars aufm Kiez but it has a special something going on for it which seperates it from the rest of the bars around here. Is is the drinks? Nah, an Astra here costs pretty much the same in every bar near the Reeperbahn. Just dont get caught drinking any other beer. Could it be the atmosphere? Maybe- the wood interior with paintings and lamps straight out of the 60s and 70s certainly lend this place some character. The foosball table and couch also add nice distractions when you dont want to dance. Oh, now that I mention it, its the dancing! People here just want to dance, dance, dance. The DJ on Thursday/weekends is likely spinning old soul 45s (think James Brown) and everyone just gets down, in an unpretentious way. The crowd here is totally not an ""Im here-to-be-seen"" scene. My stand-by when it comes to a night out aufm Kiez. Check it out."
3,"The whole family checked out Xeôm the other week for my husband's birthday dinner, and everyone left very happy! As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with genuinely happy faces. Everyone was so nice, and the atmosphere was really cool. And the staff was beyond accommodating for a large group of people.The only reason I can't give this restaurant a full five stars is that my own food was not anything fantastic. However, I did try a couple of other dishes, and they were both delicious! Soo I guess it's hit or miss there. That said, I would definitely go back. :)"
4,"An intimate wine bar with a lovely menuA short convenient walk from an M2 bus stop, I had a very pleasant evening in this wine bar which seems to have a very dedicated local clientele.  I had a salad and soup--both were extremely tasty and the recommended wine to accompany was superb.  The staff was friendly and kind and welcoming to an American on a business trip."
4,Great museum about the history of sailing and ocean shipping. Exhibits from ancient times until now.
3,"In one phrase: very authentic Bavarian place. Icecold genuine Bavarian beer served in huge Steins, typical Bavarian food, waiters in Bavarian clothes (dresses/Lederhosn), and, ehm, ""nice"" Bavarian music. You really would not realize you are in the north of Germany if it did not read ""Hamburg"" on the Menu...If you like Bavarian culture, you definitely will like this venue!"
4,"This place is fun as hell. It can get busy as hell too, but it's fun as hell. I really came for the airport, since I am an aviation nerd. The rest was just a bonus. And while I sort of had to rush through it, in the sake of a schedule, it was great to see and I will be back when I have more time. So, the airport part. You may have seen it on TV. It's pretty neat, seeing the planes take off, land, taxi around. Seeing the vehicles driving around. Seeing the airport go from day to night and back again (like the other exhibits). As an aviation nerd, I greatly appreciate the real airlines and real aircraft types being used. Now, on to the rest - really pretty neat to see Switzerland, Scandinavia, Germany, Hamburg, the USA and others all exemplified in miniature. Trains are what they are focused on, but that's hardly the only thing there. Just keep your eye out for fun little things - emergency vehicles rushing to a scene, dead bodies being fished out of the water with a coffin nearby (seriously), concerts, auto accidents, and various other random stuff. It's fun. U-Bahn and bus are nearby. Price is 12 euro per adult, which is worth it."
4,"This place is a winner! And who would have known? It's hidden behind Osterstrasse, not far from U-Bahn, impossible to spot.Come and try if you like- wine- modern ambiance- yummy snacks- relaxing summer terrace - good serviceAbout wines: open wine selection is not that extensive, but you can buy any bottle (and they have a great choice), have it served at you table in restaurant with additional 7 eur and bottle of water for free. Not cheap but worth visiting at least once. My five stars."
3,"I love their lunch meals. I go from time to time with my work colleagues and we enjoy the meals there. Normally I order a meal which consists of fried mixed vegetables, rice and kebab meat. The value for the price is great."
4,We love the food there especially special lunchs are yummy :) Its very central and reseanoble prices.
4,"Probably my favourite cafe in Hamburg. Outstanding coffee, roasted in-house and prepared with skill and love. The food is super tasty and creative. Out back there's a great view over one of the canals and the interior is very stylish. Top recommendation for specialty coffee lovers."
1,"A bland and overpriced chicken curry. A waste of time, money and my appetite. By Hamburg's standards it's not that bad  but it is a very low standard. Must do better Chutney and Hamburg generally."
3,Went there for dinner. Pretty good sushi. Probably one of the best places in town to get sushi. Nice atmosphere.
4,"This Miniatur-Wunderland is the biggest model museum in the world (in the Guinness Book of Records). They have various model constructions from Germany to USA.  There is so many houses, automobiles etc that make up the areas with most of the model villages/areas with moving elements from people to automobiles. Throughout time at the museum the lights will dim to give you a glance of how the model village looks like at night as well as during the day.  The night scenes are as spectacular as of the lights that come on in the houses, etc.  I highly recommend to anyone and don't forget to press the buttons to make some of the moving elements move.  Highly recommend to anyone that loves trains and models that move and light up."
3,"Very delicious sushi & tepanijaki place. Great price for the value, recommend! But come with an empty stomach - u eat a lot"
4,"A M A Z I N G!Other reviewers have all said it. What I can add is that the world now seems way too big... Details, sense of humor and the massive scale of this miniature world can't be missed. Two hours wasn't enough. Go on a weekday and stay for 3+ hours. Make sure you stand at each station long enough for the daylight / nighttime transitions to occur."
2,"If you want a ridiculously over-the-top ice cream, then this could be the place for you. Banana-splits, spagetti-ice cream (it looks like spagetti), milkshakes, etc. they have quite a range. It isn't cheap though. EUR4 for a milkshake and EUR6 for an ice cream dessert. Mostly everything had too much goudi colour for my tastes though. I eventually decided on a vanilla milkshake, which while it was very good, was deceptively small. I finished it almost immediately."
4,Service was amazing! Atmosphere was also great. I got bacon cheeseburger on a dark bun and sweet potato fries. The texture and flavors were well balanced and very satisfying. The food was also presented beautifully. I plan on returning soon!
1,"Very disappointed having made this a ""must do"" evert time I'm in town. The service was good. The lobster bisque Ok, and the penne beef pasta boring flat and not worth eating. My colleague ordered a gin and tonic and couldn't finish it. We ordered the tiramisu and there wasn't the hint of liquor in it - ""safe for all ages"". Not what I want from one of my favorite desserts."
3,"I can highly recommend this restaurant - we have eaten heir twice and were impressed each time. Interesting  menu, fresh ingredients and our food was delicious."
2,"novel idea. but I wouldn't recommend the experience if you want sushi in all its mastery. it's more for the preis-leistung oriented folks. 25 Euros for 2.5 hours of food binging cmon. that's borderline depravity... ;) better not talk too much now. after all been there, done that. do it if you want to feel like an iPad sorcerer having slightly overworked waiters at your beck and call."
4,"Love this place ~ reminds me of street food in Asia. Great food, friendly staff, quick service, must try if you are looking for great Vietnamese food :0)"
4,"Every time I am in Hamburg I go directly to see main man Peter at Mini-Grill,he makes the World's Best Chicken, no doubt about it. Also the 'gurken salat' (cucumber salad) is excellent and the pommes frites (french fries) are excellent with homemade curry ketchup. Also enjoy very much the original art work from the late great artist Erwin Ross, some of his last work before he was tragically struck down by an automobile. (Erwin painted Beatles logo.svg. Wordmark of The Beatles, originally painted directly on drum by Erwin Ross, Hamburg. Date. 1960) ask Peter when you are in there enjoying the world's best chicken. People actually fight over the chickens sometimes because they can not cook them fast enough, so get there when it's not busy or be patient and wait...it's worth it! Jon Hammond"
4,Super toller Strand!
3,"Our continued search to find some of the best Neapolitan style pizza in Hamburg led us here. And it's definitely a new favorite for my wife and I. Very good flavor for both pizzas we tried and a tasty and pretty chewy crust as well, however, the crust was slightly thinner and a little bit crisper than I would have liked for a standard Neapolitan pizza.The restaurant is a very spacious area, with a pleasant rustic and warming setting and atmosphere, and with plenty of outdoor seating as well."
4,"DaCaio is my favorite place to eat when I travel to Hamburg.  There is a dish called ""Del Boss"" that is consistently mind blowing and I think about it longingly when I'm far from Hamburg.  Check it out, you don't be disappointed.  Also had the tagliatelle for the first time today at lunch and it too was incredible!  Love it!"
4,"This place is amazing.It's not a ""fancy"" place, where you go, dress up and dance until morning light.It's a very simple bar, filled with a lot of Nerds. The Customers there either love Roleplay games (the ones with dices!), old TV-Series, Videogames or Sci-Fi or Fantasystuff.Most of the people there wear black band shirts and most of the time ""evil black music"" comes from the speakers, if not somebody gets out the guitar and playes a song.It's a rustical and cozy place, you easily feel home at, due to the atmosphere. The customers there are very open and the staff is super friendly and does its best to serve all special demands. Thier bartender is really nice and they have everything from coffee, over beers and shorts to fancy cocktails.It's a good place to have weirdly amazing conversations with people you just met."
3,"Good place for a quick stop for some seafood. Fresh fish, nice staff, authentic place, and good prices. What else can you ask for?"
1,"Médiocre hotel restaurant. Open later then some others. Not a ""must do""...Chewie veal, a bit burned gratin. Hideous and pretentious furnishing... Nice, but tired waitres..."
2,"A quick and easy walk from the Miniature Wonderland, this side street cafe has a nice outdoor seating area and the service was very good. The pizza was tasty as was the spaghetti bolognese.  Not a long wait at all to get the food but the beer was kept cold and full while we did wait!"
1,"Why does this have such great reviews?- great location (across the street of Hauptbahnhof)- people talk about this positively- hyped-----------------------------------------------------------------However I ate here I think 3 times. But always picked by my friends.Most positiv reviews came from non-asians I guess (of course I didn't check all reviews but I'm sure haha). It's like you are crazy about chinese beer, because you've never tried german beer hahahahahaha.People love Quan do because they've never tried the real good vietnamese pho.For 6,90€ or something the pho (vietnamese noodle soup) is way to small and you don't get side dishes here. And the soup is way to flavorless, not intense enought tho.YOU WANNA TRY REAL GOOD PHO? . . . GO TO VIETNAM!!! hahaha I'm joking.No there are better places in Hamburg then here. Don't waste your money.-----------------------------------------------------------------GOLDEN RULE:Always go to a pho place where you only see asians, because they know what's good.i.e. Always go to Spanish restaurants, where you only see spanish people.Always go to Indian restaurants, where you only see indians. You get the point.It's the same. You don't wanna get fake food, you wanna get the real deal. So you better start asking asians haha."
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (3.5/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
3,Probably my fav burger joint in Hamburg. However every time I visit is not consistent.  Sometimes the fries are fresh sometimes there not. I always get the poutine because I am canadian and it's nostalgic. It def one of the best poutines I've had except the gravy is never hot. A poutine should be served piping hot so the cheese curds melt into the gravy!
4,So neat! It is 2 floors for very detailed sceneries. Spent about an hr and a half there and definitely could use more time if it wasn't closing. The best part was the replica of the airport with planes taking off and landing.
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this place considering how long I've regularly been coming here. This is my favorite breakfast place in Hamburg. My favorite seats are in back, upstairs. This place has been a staple for me almost 10 years now. Used always come here when visiting Hamburg and before moving here. Awesome breakfasts, super nice staff, easy location, and great atmosphere. I've only been here for breakfast and can't say much about the rest of the day, but I have yet to be disappointed here."
3,OVerall a great place to have German dinner. The restaurant is very small and intimate and you must make a reservation. Everything we tried was great. Check it out!
1,"Went there on a Sunday for brunch+ or the reasons why you want to go there* Location & Atmosphere: The only reason you want to go there. At water level, still central but not overwhelmed with the crowd around the Alster a few meters away. Terrace is much larger than inside the restaurant, so you want to go there only on a sunny/warm day. There is also a possibility to sit on stairs with a drink facing the Alster and the city tower.* Food: For brunch there is a corner for 13,8EUR (drinks not included) with deli meats, smoked salmon, green salad, tomato mozzarella, veggies, scrambled/boiled eggs & white/wholewheat bread.- or the no go* Staff: a BIG downer, damn, the ladies there make you want to either go away or throw something at their faces. Attitudes (What for?) / Withering looks (need a moisturizer?) / Fish faces (Aquarium?).If you decide to go, do your best to ignore their lack of customer oriented skills (euphemism)* Food: 13,8eur is overpriced for what's served. Not a single dessert / cake on that buffet corner.The only veggies plate (eggplant, zucchini, carrots) available bathes in oil.Scrambled eggs look like there are made out of an omelette mix powder (really!?), I stayed away.All in All, You pay for the location which might be cool on a sunny day but even for that, staff might ruin the experience... too bad, I wont go again.  I do not recommend the place."
3,"For 21€ that's really a good deal. You will get more food than you can eat: the waffle was excellent, the orange juice freshly pressed and the Brötchen nicely warm. Moreover the place is extremely cozy. The atmosphere really makes the difference! Would totally go again to try a different breakfast option :)"
3,Delicious taps and other full entrees too. It's a small but busy restaurant. A little cramped but since the food was good it did not matter. Good find
4,enchiladas de mole are amazing !
3,"Copperhouse isn't bad, actually it's quite good. I really loved their lamb and halibut. This is an Asian food buffet/ teppanyaki style restaurant. It's 25 euros for all you can eat, so it's more of a come while you're starving kind of place. Most of the dishes are pretty mediocre, but the lamb and fish were delicious. Hence four stars instead of three. Some of the dishes included stir fry fried noodles, fried duck, egg rolls, fresh fruit, and fried bananas. I also had a strawberry colada which was pretty decent as well. There are some things that need improvement such as their not so good sauces and cold chocolate cake (honestly a chocolate mousse from the local supermarket would be much better than this).  Also, the sushi could use some love. I'm not sure if I would come back on my own, but if someone else suggested it I would probably come along. Oh, it's also located right on the Reeperbahn, so it's a good place to get loaded up on food before your drinking night out."
4,"A friend recommended that bistro so I had to try it out. They not only a wide variety of Galettes, they also have a nice selection of wines. My friend had a Galette with Gorgonzola and I had a Galette Begerre. The only bad thing was that some of the walnuts had to much of caramelized sugar but beside that it was very delicious and the perfect mix between savory and sweet.Highly recommended for good Galettes!"
4,"Like its St. Georg outlet cousin, Luicella's deserves the long line-ups on warm days - simply for the quality of their great ice cream. And given the location, you might even find more days without those long line-ups.This is a smaller place with a smaller assortment, and it's lacking the cute seating spaces.But they stock all their favorites, they will also give you an additional flavor to try out, and the taste is simply awesome."
3,"Food: 5 stars    Value For Money: 5 starsIt only loses a star because the place has a grungy feel (the total look, the feng shui, as well as the feel of the table tops) but otherwise what you get for your Euros is completely superb.   The sheer variety of salad thingies that go on your falafel plate or into your wrap are just so tasty, so nurturing - - eating here keeps you alive in spades, on high octane.   And the smear of hummus,  and the droozle of tahini - - a bit of olive here and multiple veggie assemblages there,  this is flavor and substance and nutrition in heaping, power-pack format.   And those aromatic, hot falafels on a cool, multi-aspected salad plate - - the concept is knock-out, and the guys behind the counter are fast and adept.   Really, really good tucker."
1,"Location, location, location. The view is fantastic - that's it. The drinks are mediocre but pricey, the staff is disinterested and poorly trained. Service is slow and needs to be hunted down. After two hours precisely, we were just about to order another round, he hostess came to our table with the next guests in tow, telling us she needed the table now - no reminder or warning, no alternative offered. There are more bars with better quality drinks and better service in town. Not going back to this one."
4,"Enzo's is around the corner from the place where we live and I came here last night with my wife for a pre-birthday meal.We had walked past the place many times but either not in the mood for Italian or it hadn't been open.So we walked in without a reservation at about 8pm and luckily got a table; 10 minutes later they were turning people away. It was nice and buzzy and fairly full with a mix of locals, tourists and business people.The waiter we had spoke German with such a strong, thick Italian accent that I couldn't understand him so we ended up speaking Italian instead! Once he knew I could speak Italian the whole experience became great; I told him more or less to choose for us then the food that came was really really fantastic.After respective starters of carpaccio and truffles & grilled squid in an octopus and black lentil salad my wife had rack of lamb and I had a Sea Bass with a salted crust. All with large glasses of red wine that we weren't told the name of but that it was 'buono' from the waiter!So it ended up being probably the nicest dinner I have had in Hamburg (maybe enven Germany so far) It wasn't cheap, at over EUR85 for two, however it would be hard to find nice food better cooked anywhere, plus the welcome, service and ambience made the difference between a good evening and great one.My wife and I agreed to go at least once a month, and I look forward to the next time.Enzo, Ci Vediamo!"
3,"Was very pleasantly surprised by this place. A friend invited me here for lunch having eaten here before. I was expecting bland kiosk style food. It turned out to be really good and the portions are solid. They have a ""Mittagskarte"" which makes everything affordable if you come during the day. I've not yet eaten dinner here but I presume it fills up fast. Service is always polite...have now been here a couple times and food tends to come out fairly quickly. It's also nice to sit outside if the weather allows for it but there aren't that many tables...as is the case with most places on the Lange Reihe."
4,"I try to visit HH at least once a year and Mo-Grill is always one of my first stops after I get to the city. Of course, we all know from reading ""The Invention of Curried Sausage"" novella by Uwe Timm that Currywurst was first created in Hamburg and the claims by Berlin are quatsch. The food at Mo-Grill is great -- served fast and hot by friendly folks and their expansion has not affected the quality. There's also a peculiar Hamburg ambiance with everyone standing around small tables eating with lots of people walking past. Nothing like it anywhere else!"
4,"We (Dave) has been looking for his ""holy grail"" of Restaurants in every country! This was it for Hamburg! The service, food and ambience was all 5 stars! They don't have an English menu, so the very patient server walked us through the whole thing then recommended an amazing French wine that complimented the meal perfectly! If in Hamburg, this is a must try! The menu has something for everyone! Vegetarian and carnivore! It's considered modern European and it does not disappoint!"
3,"I've been there only once on a sunday.the place was packed, but we did manage to find a table.The waiters are friendly, but not too friendly. which is great in such places.The food is really good, and not expensive.However on sunday its VERY loud, a lot of families, children, babies, running around and shouting at the top of their lungs!"
4,"Dank stinking grungy hole of a bar. Which I like. We saw a pretty intense gig on Saturday night (experi-mental rock), hooked up with some randoms and crashed a house party afterwards. If you don't like overheated, overcrowed hellholes... stay away!"
3,"The food is basically very good. Nothing fancy. If you like Vietnamese style dishes this is pretty nice. If you are a fanatic about Vietnamese foods this will probably fall a little short. That said, I would happily return and enjoy a different selection. Nice folks. There is outside seating today (oct 2, 2015---it was a beautiful Friday in Hamburg)"
4,"Since my visit in 2013, I've been telling everyone I know to go here who will be in Hamburg. (I'm a little surprised/ashamed I didn't write a review yet...)This place is incredible. It's several stories of a warehouse that's been converted into an aptly-named miniature wonderland. The attention to detail into every aspect of this space is simply astounding. It perfectly encapsulates what happens when smart, whimsical people set their minds to building amazing, tiny things :)Kids probably love it, too, but knowing my nephew we would probably never make it past the first floor-- it's that big and engrossing. I found the control center the most fascinating part, but others in my group liked the airport-- planes ""took off"", ""landed"", taxied and did it all over again on a schedule that was tracked in real time on a screen. Several places seem pretty darned accurately modeled in terms of what a place actually looks like; others have taken a wee bit of poetic license to make it fit within the warehouse (for example, the USA section represents Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and several other places that look as if they're right next to each other, when that is not exactly how it goes in the US). There's even a model of Hamburg. I won't spoil the wonder of visiting for yourself with any more details about what you'll see-- just plan to spend at least a few hours here to fully appreciate the splendor."
2,"Traditional swabian comfort food. Not a lot of options in menu.We took lentils and Spätzle. The lentils mash had nice flavor to it, but the Spätzle just felt like raw pasta which wasnt that interesting. We also took German dumplings (Maultaschen). I was not a fan though my friend was. The soup was good though.The desert (some apple pancake with vanilla ice cream, forgot the name) was surprisingly very good. All ingredient completed each other.Also keep in mind the place is very small with only a few tables."
4,Amazing food better than our visit to italy. The restraunt staff was so wonderful. We loved watching the chef cook our food and our mouths watered with every plate. The chef gave my son and daughter an ice cream and came personally to each table to make sure every person was happy and fully satisfied. Wonderful place they take visa Mastercard and dogs :) and my kids wanted to go again for dinner
3,"Kornhauskeller is an extremely misleading name for a Lebanese/Syrian restaurant. Then again, they have a Wiener Schnitzel special on Thursdays, which isn't something you'd expect from your typical Lebanese restaurant.Confused identity aside, food and service are on point here. I usually go for their falafel plate with salad. The ingredients are fresh, the salad isn't just a few leaves of lettuce, the combination of dressing and harissa pairs really well with everything, and there is a good balance between salad and falafel.Service is efficient and attentive, sometimes to the point of lacking warmth, especially with the head waiter (and maybe owner?). That said, they handle large groups really well for such a small space. We had a group lunch with 11 recently and were comfortably seated inside. I don't think they'd be able to accommodate a much larger group than that, though. They also have outdoor seating when the weather warms up.For clarification regarding the two signs out front, Palmyra is the catering business (and also a much better name for a Lebanese restaurant)."
4,I am in love with this place. The coffee... the food... the decor and the staff... all top notch. Such a nice atmosphere! My friend and I sat at the window and enjoyed a latte and a Guatemalan Filterkaffee & Käsekuchen. We liked it so much we even stayed for a second cup! Staff was knowledgeable about the different types of coffee and took the time to explain each one. Thank you for the great service and the tasty treats!
4,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and wanted to eat some decent Italian food before the flight. To get here we had to walk 30 minutes, and the weather outside was cold. However, all effort paid back when we got there.First the ambiance - it is a beautiful small restaurant, was not crowded that evening. They are dog-friendly, so they let us in with the dog, gave her some water, and let is pick the table we wanted.Now comes central part - food. We'be ordered pasta with cheese and ham. They clocked it very fast, and as the kitchen was nearby, the smell was impressive and stunning. When they brought us the dishes, pasta was hot, and the sauce was still boiling, this cheesy flavor that burns your mouth a bit but still tastes so delicious. Should I say that after that dinner we both were full and happily walked back to the hotel for 30 minutes!? Highly recommended, even if you need to put some effort to get there."
4,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, definitely one of my favourite bars in Hamburg. The sofas look as if time traveled from last century, and you'd probably not want to look at them during daylight, but they're so comfy and worn down, they practically engulf you when sitting on them. Drinks here are decent, but not great, but you'd probably come here for the atmosphere and the people anyways."
2,"This basic place across the street from Central Station is frequented by many Asians, which I would assume speaks for some authenticity.I was here for a late lunch - a roughly 10-11€ affair when you include a small drink. The spring roll I got was burnt and tasteless. The main dish was a little better, still unremarkable.At the lunch rate it beats all options at the station itself, but I would not have liked to pay dinner prices for this quality. If you like Indian food too, you'll probably have a better time at Badshah just a few houses up the street."
3,"This place has potential. Their service is slow, but the food is pretty good. The vegan pizzas are tasty. I think they need to work out the kinks in their delivery times, and they can be great."
3,"This place is very popular. Been here twice in the evenings and had to wait between 5-10 minutes for a table. And with good reason, the food is really good. The service is super quick, given all the people inside and those queueing combined with 2 waitresses.The menu is quite small though, ask for the English menu if you require it. Your choices are mainly between pho and rice vermicelli noodles with some meat. Very delicious food though. Top it off with beer Saigon or beer Ha. It should cost under 10 euros for your meal and a beer."
3,"I love theme bars, so Zum tanzenden Einhorn is right up my alley. Took me a visit or two to warm up to it (and to the very painful looking medieval weaponry on the walls) but now I come here for the tasty honey beer and the nice folks. This place is full of gaming nerds - my kind of company! I was a wee bit weirded out by the viking sing-alongs, but hey - it's all part of the atmosphere. It can get a bit packed here on the weekend, weekdays seem to be a good choice for a quick pint (if you don't mind that the entire rest of the pub will be sitting around playing Magic the Gathering).

0,"The lunch buffet sounded like a good deal so we wanted to give it a try. The buffet table was diverse: sushi, Asian salads and main courses. Unfortunately the quality was mediocre, if even that. I usually never try sushi in other than Japanese restaurants and I shouldn't have made an exception. Can you imagine makis filled with leftover spicy salads?I was there with my husband and our baby. During the lunch the baby woke up and cried for a few seconds until we calmed her down. Since there were no other people around (we were pretty much the only customers) I breastfed her, very discreetly, covered by a big scarf. My husband overheard the owner telling to the waitress that they should charge us more since this is unacceptable.In sum: bad food, horrible service and all but family-friendly athmosphere. Avoid the place."
4,I lovely little restaurant with fabulous staff. All the food courses were tasty and special. I would definitely recommend for dinner.
3,We've been there for the third time. Cute place for breakfast and coffee. Average friendly service. Unfortunatelly rather slow if its crowded which happens pretty much every weekend. The food is good and not too pricey. The decoration really catches the swedish atmosphere. We'll probably come back!
3,"Restaurant Engel is always a nice place to stay! With a beautiful view on the river Elbe, you can watch the container ships passing by while having a nice dinner."
3,"A respectable wine bar. It's not exactly my style, I prefer my wine bars with a bit more flourish and character. If you like the warehouse aesthetic, then this place is for you. The selection was great, the prices weren't too crazy, and the food was delicious. 4/5."
4,"This place is great. It's the only ""real"" bar in Hamburg where the bartendar probably knows more drinks than you. I used to tend bar so I am inclined to have a broad range in regards to drinks. The guys here blow me away with their knowledge. Great bartendars to ""chat"" with and talk alcohol. The vibe in the place is cool. Everyone is here because they know they are going to get the best drinks. Period! The fact that it's pretty classy in terms of the little details makes it that much better. I made the mistake last night of planning on going there after dinner for a drink with my girlfriend. Well, one drink became two and you know the rest of the story. Now I just need to figure out how best to get over there to go pick up my car. Tip: don't drive there for 1.) the obvious reason of thereafter not drinking and driving but, 2.) because there is no parking whatsover in the area.....it's all residential and you have to drive around quite a bit to find a ""legal"" spot for the car. In summary, if you're looking for ""hardcore"" bartending and really quality drink, this is your place. It's a bit off the beaten track but it's always ""on the way"" somehow. Do your best to visit!"
4,"Sometimes the popularity of this place annoys me, but that's only ever on Friday and Saturday evenings. At all other times it's really cool to have a bar that's always bustling. It's a pretty simple concept. Great lighting, comfortable seats, good drinks, handy location."
3,"Have eaten here a few times and have always been impressed with the food, the hospitality and the service. hey, if it's good enough for Cliff Richard..."
0,"Food was ok, but my husband spent a portion of the evening chained to the big white chair...Avoid."
4,"A good and reasonably priced place for getting lunch. Long queue around noon but fast service. Also, they only accept cash:("
3,"been here several times, usually pretty early in the afternoon. it's a small place, & there are only ever 1 or 2 people working at a time. thus the service can be pretty slow; however, i find that the croques are worth it. i always get the antipasti croque, it's amazing, and also big enough that i take half home & get a second meal out of it (your mileage may vary). try dining in the quiet little garden out back if the weather's nice."
4,"I absolutely love and recommend the location for a 'half-decadent' Friday lunch. Food is modern Vietnamese cuisine, the serving process is optimized and even when you see a long queue you will still be seated and served within less than 10 minutes. The staff is extremely friendly. It can be noisy and crowded at times but that's part of the experience too."
0,"Germany big cities are trying to trend it up with Asian Fusion food everywhere but bare in mind in Northern part of Germany they dont neccessarily find Asians as Beautys.First off, I'm sad this is just another Western water down fast food joint where the quality is shit and everything is over salted and spicy portion dropped for the Scandinavian palate.I recommend for Authentic Vietnames, go to Green Papaya down the street.It's always packed and this is probably reason why others suck cause the Best is always packed and too popular."
3,"A good spot! Menu is heavy on burgers (probably shouldn't be surprised, though), but the salad -- the salad was amazing. Still thinking about it a day later. If I were here longer I'd go back!"
4,"Randomly happened to be here as a business partner picked it. Never had heard of it before. What a nice find. Love that their stuff is all organic. Super simple, yet stylish decor with a relaxed atmosphere. Service was truly top-notch and very helpful as well as attentive. Most importantly, the food (at lunch) was really good. I found the prices to also be very fair for the quality of food which you are getting. A bit of a pain to get to if you're coming by car (limited parking) or public transport (no subway right near by) but I will definitely make an effort to come back. Will bring my g/f along next time."
3,"This place deserves the name, burger+lieblich, burger with love. Although burger always gives impression of chain fast food, you realize they are more than that after having it at Burgerlich. Really a cool place to hang out with friend and be a ""Hamburger"""
4,I guess Stadtpark is the main park in Hamburg. It's certainly one of the bigger parks and is the best set up to cater for you having a good time: - There are a few beer gardens scattered through the park- There is a huge outdoor swimming pool- There is a huge lawn that people are always barbecuing on- There is an impressive planetarium- There is a boating lake- There is a large outdoor amphitheater where many large bands play (I've seen Neil Young there and also The National) etc. etc.
4,"Fancy hipster coffee shops exist outside of San Francisco, go figure. Admittedly SF probably just copied places like this one.Elbold Röstkaffee has all the marks of a hipster coffee place: 1) Crowded with people sitting around, drinking coffee, and not on laptops2) More real estate dedicated to bean roasting equipment than restaurant space3) Visible bean roasting equipment4) Handwritten labelingDelightful chocolate candy treat served with the coffee, yum!, and a great place to spend the afternoon catching up with friends."
3,"Really nice bar in the middle of Schanze, with really nice bartenders and good cocktails. It usually becomes very crowded at around 10 or 11. Plus they've got an almost hidden table football that ends up being one of the distinctive reasons to go there and have fun challenging friends."
3,"A lovely place to spend a summer's day. Swim, sunbathe, take a boat trip, visit the planetarium or sit in Schumacher's beer garden. Also a concert venue. nice for outdoor concerts although they have to finish by 10pm."
4,"I felt like I am in a good restaurant somewhere in South-East Asia, a real thing. Very peacefull, calm, full of orchids  very differnt from any Asian restaurants in Hamburg. My partner and me tried two different menus and all dishes were tasty, except of curries  too salty.Not as pricy as I thought. Would definitely come back again."
1,"The food was amazing. And it's such a cosy venue.The service, however, was pretty bad. Our waitress tried very hard, and was very friendly. But:- Apparently the person showing guests the tables was new, and she sent everyone to tables serviced by the same waitress.- As a result, every time we wanted to order drinks or food, it took ages to order, and even longer to arrive.- After waiting an hour for our food, it turned out the kitchen lost our order (and of the table next to us), and we had to wait ages again for our food. Not sure the good food outweighted the huge wait."
3,"This is a very hip bar not far from Hamburg uni. The lighting is spot on, the venue is cleverly designed and has comfy seating arrangements and a great bar to sit at. The Barstaff are knowlageble and friendly and they have a 5 euro cocktail menu...the Cosmopolitains being so scrummy I wish I had of had time to order another one.There's table football and a DJ box with a Live DJ playing music that sets the tone but isn't too overpowering on your conversation. Located right near the cinema this is a great place to pop in pre film or afterwards. Bonus points for the decor, it's adorable....feel like going back though wiht a gold metalic marker next time and drawing a horn on all the little gold ponies painted on the wall as then it would be a unicorn bar wouldn't it?"
3,"I've been here twice and had different experiences each time.The first time was amazing. Everything tasted fresh and the spices were all combined perfectly to make a really delicious and aromatic meal.The second time wasn't quite as good. The curry was great, but the rice just didn't seem properly cooked. In fact, the whole meal just didn't seem fresh enough.Although the service does seem a bit comatose, I will say that the staff didn't fall short when it came to problem resolution. They replaced a drink that we were dissatisfied with free of charge  no attitude whatsoever, despite the fact that it was obviously our fault for ordering the wrong drink to begin with.The prices are a bit high and it seems the quality can be inconsistent, but overall  a decent place to grab some good Asian food."
4,Excellent gyros and other Greek specialities from very friendly people who know their food. Also a great take-away selection.
4,"I went here for lunch and had the roast beef, with fried potatoes and salad (it cost 10.80€). We got to Hej Papa at around 12:30 and got the last table. If you are a large company it might make sense to reserve a table or come early. Anyways, might have been the best roast beef I have had here in Hamburg, so really good! The pasta dishes and salads looked really good too, so there's plenty to choose from."
3,"First of all: No, Steffen Henssler was not there during our visit :( He is the most famous (and best) TV chef and cooking entertainer. Location: The location is very close to an U-Bahn-Station. It is rather small, but got a very high-quality and cozy atmosphere. We just loved it. Everything looked so nice, clean and had a recognizable ono-branding. What always makes a good impression: open kitchen, where you can watch the sushi-chefs make your sushi.But it is always overbooked and hard to get a reservation. So plan your visit a lot in advance.Service: The staff was very friendly. Got everything we wantedFood: Very good food. I've never had such a good fish in my life. I was a little bit sceptic, because I don't like tuna, but the yellowfin tuna was awesome and did not taste like the ordenary tuna (you find on pizza). If you order something, you should have fish/sushi. Pricing: Prices are a little bit higher than in a standard sushi restaurant. We paid around 80 Euros for 2 persons (main dish, desert, drinks). But it is totally worth it for special occasions or just have a nice unique evening, you will remember."
4,Had Bananenbrot and Vegetable Quiche with Salad yesterday. Both were so delicioussssss and of high quality. Veggies are so fresh. Quiche was just perfect. And Bananenbrot was just so yummy I had to eat in a row in 2 days. The restaurant is lovely and the staff are very nice. Highly recommended!
3,I visited this Italian restaurant on my first trip to Germany. Our seat was right in front of the brick oven which was great to see and also the man making the pizza was most entertaining with his singing.  I had a large beer and a tomato and mozzarella appetizer. Let's not forget the main dish a large pizza pie with all the works. If you are not a big eater remember to share. If you have been longing to devour a large pizza pie on your own. Order and dive right in. I will be back on my next trip to Germany with my family.
3,"If you're in Ottensen at 5am and want to go to a lively bar, well, you don't have many choices. Familien Eck would be one though. Maybe one of the reasons is that it's pretty tiny, so it doesn't need that many people to be lively :) It's basically a dive bar, and a fair percentage of the crowd will probably be quite alternative/punky looking. Everyone is nice though, and the drinks are a reasonable price. One noteworthy thing is that to save space they have the DJ working almost on the ceiling! It's hard to describe, so you'll just have to see for yourself."
2,"The grilled fish and meat is really good and would warrant the fourth star. Unfortunately sides are a little bland, and sauces clearly contain ready-made convenience ingredients. Atmosphere is ok, and they keep distributing glasses of Raki..."
1,Although their sign says Thai and Vietnamese food I didn't see much Vietnamese on the menu. I had the Penang Curry which was quite nice and a beer. The food was ok and plentiful but the table and the condiments on it were a bit greasy. I'm not really precious but it felt a bit grotty. I prefer my restaurants to be cleaner.
2,"Right across from the Hauptbahnhof stands Nagel, one of the many German restaurants ín the city centre trying to attract tourists. It is nicely decorated, roomy and clean with interesting art-work on the walls. The menu choice is respectable as is the choice of drinks and the prices.My only complaint with this place is that I didn't find it very family friendly. It was made plain clear that my pram was in the way and it was even suggested to me that I should just leave it on the street - despite the fact it had a sleeping baby inside.This is still however a firm favourite for family and friends visiting from the UK"
3,"It's always nice to chase away the daily routine at Café du Passage in Winterhude. It's like a little hideout with its friendly staff and the nice food & bev. You can get anything from breakfast over quiche to cakes and it's all yummy, promised.As a plus there's a vast selection of tea available, too.Prices are fine and so is the interior. It's just set up with heart and soul. You can nearly feel it.It's just lovely to sit (inside or outside) there and goggle at the passersby. Alternatively you can read magazines and books if you feel like wanting a quiet time to yourself.Once you were lucky enough to find this little jewel I bet you will keep coming back again and again and again and again"
0,"Save your €26.50 and head to a real restaurant.  This one is a joke for service and value for money. Eaten in many places like this all over the world, and  don't expect much.  Buffet is extremely basic for the money, pre cooked food was with cheap ingredients and small choice.  ""Live Cooking"" is ok, although hygiene of the food is far from ok.  Flies buzzing around the mounds of uncooked meat and fish and the cook didn't seem to know what he was doing.  The very small selection Sushi was awful, cheap and dried out.  The tiramisu was a mushy mess left in the bowl, the scraps from others desert helpings.  Asked the head waiter if they had a fresh tiramisu, who did get a fresh one, but proceeded to moan at his customer that normally you need to finish off the scraps before they can change, or their boss gets angry... All in all, save your disappointment and keep on walking..."
4,"The food is really good, the price is reasonable for what you get! The food comes a little late, which means is made fresh. And it was fresh! The personal are also very friendly. Next plan is brunch!"
3,"The name of this restaurant is fitting for my wife and I as we have ""desired"" to dine here for quite some time. Still we wonder sometimes what took us so long. If you've walked along Gertigstrasse at any point on a beautiful and warm evening you will notice that Deseo is one of two very popular tapas restaurants that are always seemingly buzzing. The vibe here is definitely more upscale than Arcada, just a half block down, and it's also reflected in the prices. The food here is very good though and very much worth a go.A reservation almost seems mandatory when dining on the weekend, and I would highly recommend it. Having made our reservation just a couple days prior, my wife and I studied and salivated over the menu, pretty much knowing exactly what we'd order once we arrived. We started off with complimentary bread, aoili and olives, which all of were great. We then proceeded to order the pimientos de Padrón, goat cheese with potatoes, chorizo, bacon-wrapped dates, prawns in garlic oil, and calamari in garlic oil. Every dish we had was savory and delicious; ones that I would definitely order again.Service was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice here as my wife and I indulged on our ""desired"" dishes and observed life passing from our window-bar seating."
4,"After reading about this place in the New York Times' 36 Hours in Hamburg, I went to Hamburg just to see this place and I was not disappointed.We spent 3 hours(2.5 hours looking and 30 minutes in the cafeteria where they have several types of beer and free wifi)  there and still felt that we had missed things. The scope was amazing as was the detail.The only reservation that they had online was at 6:30 pm on the day we wanted to go (which was a holiday weekend in Germany). This was a great time to go as there were no lines and very few people.We ate in the cafeteria at 8:30 pm (they stop serving food at 9 pm) but they were still replenishing the food and it was pretty good (3 Radlers and 2 wurst and frites dinners for 17 Euros).They have a coat and baggage check. They also have charging lockers for digital camera batteries. You need a 1 Euro coin to start the charging, but you get it back when you retrieve your charged battery. They know that people take a lot of pictures here and they run down their batteries."
3,"Totally worth the 30 minute wait. TOTALLY WORTH IT! Anyone who knows me knows I am on a mission from the Tex-Mex Gods to find the best burrito in Europe. This is the running. First of all the guacamole was heaven. HEAVEN I tell you. It was so good that, despite knowing I should stop so I could finish my burrito, I could not help myself. I had to eat it or my soul would perish. The burrito was just as good, well seasoned, perfected black beans, ungodly amounts of cheese. Oh BURRITO LORDS, WHY MUST I LIVE IN PRAGUE WHEN THIS SUBLIME TASTE OF TEX-MEX IS IN HAMBURG!?!?!? OH THE HUMANITY!!!!Added to this brilliant experience of burrito bliss, were the two lovely men working the smallish restaurant. I think I made the chef's day by singing the praises of this religious moment in my mouth. The only reason they don't get five stars is burritos need margaritas. Other than that, I will darken their door whenever I am in Hamburg."
3,"Yes it's true: it's a beach club in the middle of town. Complete with sand, chairs, ping pong and more (but no volleyball, sigh...)Yelp turned me in to this and because I needed a chill vibe and uncomplicated food st reasonable prices I came here. No Chardonnay but I made do with a Pinot Grigio. The next stand over o ordered the Curry Wurst and Pommes with Mayo. Nice large portion of all and the Curry Wurst was tasty but I'm not used to the sweet-sour glaze it swam in. One drawback...no cards. Cash only and you don't know that before you order. I guess I really should get used to asking that ahead of time because I keep running into that. But there are places you just expect to be able to use a card and a restaurant is just one of those. I can see how this place would be packed on a summer afternoon or weekend. Too fun!"
4,"Great Food, but, BEST Pizza!! - If you don't like to wait (even with reservation) and don't want to hang close with locals (it is somewhat tight in there), this is not the place for you. But if you worship Pizza...man this is it and great atmosphere the later it gets. If you ask for Sambuca, they'll give you a whole bottle and trust you with it and you'll get into party mood with the patrons."
4,"Ok, I'm not usually a Starbucks fan, but this location and place is awesome. The building and location are super, super, super. So pretty. As an American, I sometimes miss flavors from home. Sometimes it is lovely to taste a soy Chai Tea latte. Or banana bread. Or something that is loaded with chocolate and an insane amount of calories and just tastes American. What better way to enjoy those flavors than in a beautiful Altbau building right on the Alster?The barristas were--gasp!--friendly, seemed to have been well-versed in American culture.The secret is out--this is a great place to go to for a get-away from the stress of German life."
2,"This big, bustling restaurant is a good place for a comfortable, casual meal with friends. Food is good--nothing memorable, but something for everyone.  Service can be a little challenged at times, but when that happened to us once, before we could even consider complaining, they were right up front with an apology and offer of free after dinner coffees/drinks.  Any restaurant can have an off night, few will acknowledge it, and that gets points from me."
1,Staff is far not that friendly as in the US but ok. Food is good!!
3,"Durch Qype sind wir auf das Restaurant aufmerksam geworden. Unscheinbar von außen; klein und gemütlich innen. Ich hatte einen Tisch für eine kleine Geburtsfeier gebucht. Schöner, dekorierter Tisch in der Ecke mit Überblick. Herzliches Willkommen durch Frau Teichmann. Das Geburtstagskind wurde mit einem kleinen Küchlein mit Kerze überrascht. Wir bestellten Pannfisch, einfach köstlich. Der empfohlene Wein ein Genuss. Die Nachspeise  eigentlich war kein Platz mehr  war der krönende Abschluß. Das Sagners ist ein Spitzenrestaurant. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Trip nach Hamburg wieder vorbeikommen. Wir wünschen Herrn und Frau Teichmann viele Gäste und weiterhin viel Kreativität."
3,"Quan Do's food i good, but the menu is very limited to Pho, fried noodles, weekly offers and some appetizers. BUT nonetheless the Pho I had was delicious as well as the spring rolls. The only thing I didn't like was the staff which was a bit rude (maybe I caught them on a bad day) and the fact that you cannot get Pho to go or take leftovers with you. They only offer a large Pho, which is pretty big, so it's sad that you have to waste the leftovers. Besides that I think the restaurant is great (no sure how much it qualifies as street food though) and I will be going here again!"
3,"Had a lovely dinner at this cozy lakeside restaurant. Really reasonable for pretty sizable portions of delicious dishes. Three of us shared three entrees. We tried the daily special which was a whole white fish of some sort with crispy skin. Then three fish fillets that included what seemed to be salmon, halibut and another meatier white fish lightly fried and served on Dijon mustard sauce. We also tried the famous labskaus dish which looked like raw minced meat. I was alarmed until I realized it was warm and was the color of beets. Everything was served in generous portions with sides of pickles and vegetables and so on. The only thing we didn't care for was the risotto. Very nice service by a lovely host who spoke English. Recommend making a reservation. Good for a date followed by a lakeside stroll. ;)"
4,Fantastic food and atmosphere. Leave enough time to get through all the yummy dishes. Probably a good idea to make a reservation!
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (4/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
2,"This review is for the Tattoo Exhibit only. Went to the museum today excited to see what would be portrayed about Tattoo history etc. Basically, it was a lot of photographs of modern day tattoo wearers talking about their tattoos. A few old machines in a display box, a ton of tattoo books on a table, and displayed pigments.  The exhibit seemed super touristy in a sense that it was very basic, and maybe curated by someone fascinated by the culture, and not actually a part of it.I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the historic Skin Samples on display. That saved the exhibit. Everything else you can see in the same fashion on the internet. Pictures of pictures etc."
4,"StrandPauli is a nice place, really well located. You can chill on the deckchairs resting on the sand and enjoy the cocktails. They offer free glasses of water which is a big plus for me, as many places don't want to, even if it is tap water."
4,"Did anyone say ""Hamburgs best pizza""?? They might have said that. I wouldn't know if they were right, cause this is the only Pizza place I'be been to in Hamburg. But one thing Im sure of: They make damn fine pizza at Pizza Bande!Its a very nice place, made me want to linger for longer, just to take in the atmosphere. But loads of people want to eat here - so we ate, and left. Judging by the number of people outside, waiting for a place to sit, I'd say that the Hamburg people love this place to. So it might just be the best damn pizza they have. I kinda even wish I could have one now ... mmmm. And one tip: Go for their specials, you might think the combinations are odd. But they are good!"
4,Had a lovely dinner here in Hamburg at [m]eatery.Now I don't eat beef so can't review them on all their dry aged beef. Normally don't eat any meat but occasionally will eat seafood and fish. I started with the seafood chunky chowder and it was thick and creamy with tons of flavor. Great way to start. For my main I ordered 3 types of fish tartare. They could not have been any better. The highlight was the salmon tartare Asian style. Wow was it freaking delicious! Now my side dish may have stole the show. Mashed potatoes with sautéed shallots and black truffles! So amazing! So if ever in Hamburg Germany hit this place up!
4,"Very warm atmosphere. The coffee is great, everything seems homemade and the breakfast is amazing. It's a popular place, so it fills quickly on weekends. Lovely!"
4,I saw this place on yelp. The staff spoke English too!!I was welcomed by the owner and was treated very well.Your journey starts with feta cheese accompanied with herbs. The feta cheese was very very fresh and good!!I ordered a lamb sultani and it was amazing. The steak was luscious and so was the koubideh. Also their yogurt drink was pretty authentic and worth a try!!Do try this place if you like Persian food.
3,"Nice selection of coffees, spacious interior and tons of good food options."
4,"Wow this was the best Chocolate Factory tour/experience ever !!!You learn all about chocolate where it comes from, to how it is grown and then the whole process to how it becomes to being a chocolate bar with many tastings along the way.  This is the first tour that I have ever been on that involved so much tasting from start to finish and making your own bar.  At the beginning 5 lucky people can try the beans (that are covered in the white slimy flesh) that come from the big fresh coco pods (first time ever seen a real fresh one not a model version).  I was one of the lucky ones and it tasted a bit like a lychee / melon.  Don't miss out. We then went along and tasted the beans after being roasted, we then made a bar with a choice of approx 10 ingredients to sprinkle all over our bar from gummy bears to nuts, then we watched the machines that made the chocolates from the melting process to the wrapping of the bars. You can even weigh yourself to see how many chocolate bars you would equal to I was around 640 bars. At the end you then get your bar back from the fridge and wrap it up and the chocolate by the way is gorgeous a bit like Lindt.  I highly recommend to any chocolate lover.  The only thing that lets this factory down is that there is only one tour during the day that is in English and that is done at 12:30 so if you want to go along to this place and you can only speak English then don't miss that tour at that time."
4,"An overwhelming experience in taste.  Every dish was equally delicious - antipasti dish, pasta Bolognese, and Hake with quinoa."
2,"3 stars because i am not a fan of zoos. and because its not THAT bigBut ive been told this is the biggest privately financed zoo in germany. i went there during the jungle nights in june. entrance costs 17.5EUR (1.5EUR extra to the normal days)On that night, the zoo was open till at least 11.30 with shows all over the zoo. Well as i said before i am not a fan of zoos, so i cant say i had a lot of fun. It's not very big but has a number of different exotic animals. But the thing is I've been to the Leipzig zoo and the leipzig one was much bigger than hamburgs with much more variety. So i was kinda suprised that hamburgs zoo wasnt 'small' And on that evening, hagenbecks was really full, and a lot of kids running back and forth. They seemed to be enjoying their time. Now that i have seen the zoo, supported it financially, i don't think i will be back.Ive seen their lions, pinguins, giraffes, monkeys, tigers, lions ... so i dont need to come back to see them all over again :P Oh and the kangaroo part of the zoo stinks by the way, i couldnt stay inside more than 30 seconds! The best part is that you can feed the animals, had i known i would have taken some fruits and veggies with me... However, worth the visit. I dont regret going there at all!"
1,"- this place is way way over rated- very friendly service and good beer, and place is always full which is fun. - also very family friendly so that's all good, however the steaks and the burger are really not great.- steaks look ok and are cooked ok, but they just do not taste of much unfortunately, you will not find any good variety Scottish, Argentinian or Swiss staff here.- unfortunately I also have to score their burger down. The New York cheeseburger is not in fact a burger. The meat tastes like an Italian meatloaf, and it's basically served on a crusty half slice Italian bread, with thin chips and cheese. It tastes ok, but it should be called the Italian sandwich not a cheese burger.- unlikely that I will eat steak or burger her again"
3,"Crispy duck was good, bulgogi as well which comes with kimchi. The soups are ok, good do with an extra prawn and less grease. The price was excellent and service was good"
4,"Hands down the best meal I had in Hamburg.  And the best Spatzle I've ever had!  The restaurant is so charming. It's locally run and serves traditional food from Swabia. There are so many exciting choices to choose from. My friend had a tofu spatzle and I elected for the special of the day which contained spinach, feta, and bacon.  The noodles are SO FRESH.  The service is delightful. All of the ingredients are locally sources and handmade. The portions are huge! I cried a tear knowing that I couldn't bring back the leftovers. The wine is also very good. PLEASE you must go here.  They are excellent!!!"
4,"The food was really delicious, and the service couldn't have been much better.  My wife and I each had a different lamb dish, and they were both so tasty--tip: don't eat the whole lemon that is cooked in with the dish.  Gently press the lemon to get the juices out, and then discard.  We also had a desert each, which we don't usually do.  We weren't disappointed.  There was a saffron ice cream with pistachios on top--lightly sweet with a gentle perfume after-taste--maybe rose.  The second doesn't have an english word.  It very fine angel-hair-like noodles suspended in an icy sweet amalgam, and you drizzle a lemon flavor on it.  It also had a gentle perfume after-taste that came in after the sweet was done.  Teheran was a great experience--I learned more about my one meal than I've learned about food in a long time, and it was all delicious."
2,"I went with a friend of mine that I haven't seen for years to have a dinner there, he told me that the pizza there is just out of this world. The place was a bit crowded on Friday evening, it took around 5 minuets to get seated which was fine. The waitress came and took our order and she was really nice. We ordered shrimps with garlic pizza which tasted fantastic. I was actually shocked by how big the pizza is over there.The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because my friend was drinking from a glass that was broken and he got his lips cut, and when they replaced the glass, the new glass was also broken. I believe they have to pay some extra attention to that.Overall, the restaurant is a one that I would recommend, but unfortunately we had this problem over there."
3,"We stopped by here on a whim - the prospect of a margarita while sitting outside in the warm weather was too good to pass up.And the margaritas, and service, did not disappoint. I'll preface by saying we love margs, but only the good ones, not the sweet syrupy ones. These were incredible, handmade (took a little while) and delicious. We were also told they were bringing us Nachos which was a nice gesture but we anticipated a microwaved mess. Instead, we got a plate that was more like hot, homemade tomato / bean dip with a few tortilla chips layered in. Combined With the spicy homemade chili sauce, it was delicious. Service was great too, excited to go back for a full meal!"
3,"Looks like I'm going to have to go ahead and edit my review again, bringing Viale Antico back up to 4 stars. The service seems to have gone back to it's original, snappy self - I guess last summer wasn't a good time for them. Their prices, however, have remained higher than they originally were. I haven't gone back with a large party so I'm not sure how they'll handle more than a few people, but I've been coming here once a week with one or two lunch-mates and the service has been friendly and snappy. I like that at Viale Antico I can order whatever I want - regardless of if it's on the menu or not - and I can ask for any modifications of menu items. --- ORIGINAL EDIT --- Unfortunately I'm going to have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant to two stars. In the past few months, the quality of service has dropped dramatically and the prices of the dishes have increased. More times than not, two or more of our party have been receiving their dish considerably later (up to 40min) than the rest of us and the staff has been rude to us, which provides for an uncomfortable and nerve-wrecking lunch experience. At this point in time I cannot recommend Bistro Viale Antico. --- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW --- Bistro Viale Antico is across the street from the new Qype HQ on Deichstrasse. We strolled upon it accidentally this afternoon as a part of our lunch-hour-wander, to find restaurants in the area. I ordered the Scampi pasta, which was probably one of the better Scampi pastas I've had. Most other restaurants drench the spaghetti in sauce and throw in a few scampis. The pasta I received had a very light garlic/butter sauce with fresh herb seasoning and had plenty of scampi. The price was reasonable. 7.50eu is what I paid for my dish, which is higher than I'm accustomed to, but the quality of the service and food was much higher than I am accustomed to, as well."
2,"A Falafel place that is a bit more spacious so you actually enjoy sitting down and a bit cleaner than your average 'orient bistro'.Food quality is perfectly fine, flavours could much improve if they toasted the wraps / breads."
4,"Super cute ice cream shop ! The place is cosy, modern and full of charm.They have different and original flavours such as strawberry-rosmarin, salty caramel or coconut-strawberry. If you have allergies, it is really easy to understand how the ice creams are made of, thanks to a colours system. They also create vegan ice-creams ! You can either eat inside or take-away."
2,"Non-food: 5/5Food: 3/5The decor and overall vibe of this restaurant is exquisite, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the menu has extensive vegetarian and meat options. After the meal, one is served mango schnapps and paan mukhwas.I ordered naan bread and spicy chicken tikka masala, which came with rice. My meal arrived very quickly, and the presentation of the food was very on-point (see attached photos), just like the ambiance. My waiter also brought a green chili sauce, which wasn't that spicy but tasted very good.I thought the tikka masala here wasn't bad but wasn't great and wouldn't order it again. I'd also recommend picking a different dish if you're between options. The naan was very tasty, and the rice was decent.I can recommend this restaurant for a group dinner due to the great ambiance and service quality. Despite not being super impressed with the taste of my entree, I left feeling very satisfied and want to come back to try a different dish."
2,"The Parlament is hidden in the Rathaus basement?; the reason why I probably have never seen it before.Inside the interior is really majestic and richly ornated. The crowd is a bit older, up against 40.The atmosphere is quite formal, but fits fine with the venue. The food seems to be expensive, but I havent tried it yet. Nice to take your parents, or just enjoy a typically businesslike/historical spot in Hamburg. Tourist or not."
2,"I had such high hopes for Cafe Mexico but alas it was a bit of a let down. The service is ok, very nice, even though our server was slow with the drinks and spilled a whole plate of creamy enchiladas all over our coats. That was something I'll never forget, I don't think my coat will either. The menu seemed to have a lot of choices but in actuality it did not. It just a lot of repetition and white space. Mexican food is one of my favorites so I knew what to expect and I was not expecting what was put down in front of me. Once I got my food, it was extremely cold, as if they had the kitchen in another building and walked it over in the dead of winter. Even though they told me mine would take a few minutes longer because it had to cook longer it was actually one of the first dishes to come out. I might give this place another chance but I am not rushing back there anytime soon. I will just have to hang my sombrero and wait until I come across a real, authentic Mexican experience."
4,"I don't if it is because I was starving or something, the lunch sandwich I got there was stunning! I had Schweinebratens sandwich with salad. The meat was tender and juicy and the sauce is tasty. Everything tastes perfect! God I am hungry now. Definitely would like to come again and recommend to friends."
2,Not one of the most obvious or attractive restaurant fronts I have seen. And on this particular day I have to say that I dont agree with some of the other reviewers with regard to friendliness of the staff. But the food is good and genuinely Italian as is the atmosphere inside. I had a great Saltimbocca (always a good test!) and was waiting for The Godfather to turn up at any minute. Cuneo is easy to find from St Pauli U Bahn and I am sure I will return
4,"Really great Vietnamese street food obviously made fresh, very flavorful! A nice menu with some unique options to choose from including the popular Pho soup, grilled pork on noodles, or their specialty drinks (like the Gingerly with lime/mint/brown sugar, tangy yet sweet). Reasonable prices, but if you come at the prime times for lunch or dinner you will have to wait for seating since it is a small place (worth it though!)."
4,"If you are in Hamburg and do not go to Sagner's, you are making a mistake. We were surprised there was not a line around the block given the small restaurant size. We had two excellent apps in the beef carpaccio and the scallops and mushrooms. Make a reservation and go. It is an excellent small family restaurant."
3,The Goldfischglas is a nice bar at the Schanze. The menu offers the usual drinks and a few cocktails. It was very crowded and noisy. There is a tabletop football available. Enjoy
4,"Miniatur Wunderland is the entire reason I visited Hamburg.  There are not words that can adequately describe how amazing and enjoyable Miniiatur Wunderland is.  We spent almost the entire day there, and it wasn't long enough.If you don't know what it is, it is the world's biggest ""model railroad"", but it is SO much more!  There are full replicas of entire cities with a level of detail that is second to none.  All of the vehicles are fully automated, day changes to night every 15 minutes, vehicles respond to emergencies (vehicle fire in a tunnel, for example), airplanes take off and land, and there are TONS of hidden items all over the place.  NOTE TO PRUDES: Yes, there are naked figurines, some engaging in sexual activity.  This is not gratuitous or widespread, and where present, is very much tongue-in-cheek.  Germans are FAR more open and accepting of the human body and not treating it in a shameful fashion as is more common in America.When you go (which you MUST), be sure to purchase the ""behind-the-scenes"" tour.  It is money well-spent, and gives you lots of insider information and access to some interactive parts of the exhibit that are only accessible by those on the tour.  The tours are available in English, and go by VERY quickly.  If I go again, i may book two just to I can spend more time in the second part on the pieces about which I had more questions.Bring a camera, and lots of extra batteries and memory cards or tapes (if you're still using old technology), but be sure to enjoy and savor the experience in person.  Spend the whole day, too."
4,"I got the best calamaris (baby calamari) here, I love them so much I eat only this food here. So amazing and even my friends tried them and told so. The other food I have tasted from others was also nice but the calamari.... Can´t wait to come again."
3,"What a strange experience this place was. It's a bar trying to be a dive in one of the richest parts of Hamburg. Weird mix of people: on one hand, the grungy rocker types and at the same time, young yuppies, wearing the standing collars and Burberry scarves. Really odd but at the same time amusing. The staff think they are tougher than they are working in a place like this but it fits the goal of the bar. Really tight quarters when it fills up but the vibe is good. If in the area though, a good place to grab a drink and have a couple laughs. You'll definitely not regret it even if this isn't your thing."
4,"The best pizza ever! Leave it to a little Italian joint in the Portuguese section of Hamburg to make the most mouth-watering, buttery slice of heaven. The place is tiny, crowded and noisy, but the waiters are charming and fun. When in Hamburg, you've got to try Luigi's!"
4,best 24 hour tuerkisch place in hamburg! love the service! have been schlepping everyone here since decades. good comfort food right when feeling a cold or flue wanting to creep out of the system!
3,A great place to eat as a couple or with a group of friends. Great service and food. Moderately priced. Good atmosphere. All in all we had a great experience. We will definitely return.
4,"Amazing food, great service, one of the best low-key restaurants I have been to in a long time. The menu changes daily based on what fish is fresh that day. All the food is melt-in-your-mouth good  - amazing seafood and an incredible parmesan pasta dish with truffles. Very nice, but not too fancy. Pretty much a perfect dining experience!"
3,"It's too bad that I'm not a big fan of Absinthe (it's the alcohol content and the aniseed that kill it for me), otherwise I'd probably make this place a second home. There's something mysterious and magical about the Absinth Bar, which reminds me of my teenage years, when we'd all dress up in black and run around the streets at night, hopping from bar to bar and listening to Within Temptation (I'm losing points for this, aren't I). The couple that runs this place are part of what makes this place a must-visit. The guy who served our table was extremely knowledgeable about Absinthe and it's sorts. It was obvious that this place was built around their passion for the drink and it's culture. The establishment itself is small, dimly lit and, well, green. It reminded me a bit of a bar you'd find in Narnia, after passing through the closet. I didn't have any Absinthe, but my friends did - the prices didn't seem like they'd break the bank, but they weren't entirely cheap, either. To be honest, if I would have ordered some Absinthe, I'd probably prefer to pay an extra few euros and get a quality drink. I'm following the age-old beer rule here: the cheaper the beer, the bigger the hangover. Perhaps I'll order a drink during my next visit, since it seems the folks who run the place will probably be able to suggest an Absinthe which my body won't, err, reject. I will, however, take a star off the rating for the seating arrangements in the bar. They are somewhat uncomfortable (hard wooden bench-type arrangements) and I'd like to think that a good Absinthe is at least 40% general atmosphere. Recommended to folks who'd like to try something different for a change."
1,"If you need food come here, if you need good food, look elsewhere.Service is good, but it's not thai food they are serving, but on the other hand, it is boring and tasteless."
3,"We were visting the Bistro, not the Brasserie, so cannot comment on the latter. Further, we had the meal as part of the hotel's package, so any comments on whether it's price-worthy I cannot made. It was quite ok. Food was good (although the kids had a better choice, IMO) and the service was friendly. The only criticism I have, and it's something which happens in many places: Service was efficient while the place was packed, but later on, with fewer guests, there weren't many around anymore."
3,"We went there for the coffee and were pleasantly surprised by the food.  The toasted bagel the hubs ordered with lox & all the trimmings was so very tasty.  A little dab of sweet mustard was the secret ingredient.  -feeling a bit under the weather I ordered a small (4dl?) carrot juice with ginger.  It was just how I would have made it for myself.  The ginger boost was such that I felt I'd never catch a cold again!  Both the bagel and juice were served by a smiling young woman who works in the kitchen.The light roasted beans a la a roastery in Sweden (naturally!) make for a slightly-sour-never-bitter cup and I, for one, am quite glad about that.  The flat white is made with a lactose-rich milk that produces a lovely sweet flavour when heated correctly.  The espresso macchiato (aka noisette in Parisian third wave joints) is made with a 'usual milk' and the drink is tinged with a sour note.We then ordered an Aeropress and were presented with *thee* most choice one could ever hope for!  I think the selection was upwards of twelve different roasts!  Qual der Wahl, baby.  Some of the roasts were meant to ape various black tea varieties.  Eric chose an African bean, Kamigeri, and was quite pleased with both the aroma and flavour.  -a hint of black tea, orange and currant.The young man behind the counter was very enthusiastic, friendly and didn't assume that one didn't know a fig about coffee.  -could be due in part to his having only been on the job for approximately two weeks on our visit.  This made for a friendly exchange when ordering.Winterhude, the area in which SEC is located, is also in and of itself worth a visit.  For those out-of-towners keen to visit H.H., I would strongly encourage not only a trip out of the usual destinations like Reeperbahn & the Harbor, but a trip specifically up to Winterhude with a stop or more in Eimsbüttel as well."
0,"Probably the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Rude, condescending and exceptionally slow."
3,"The ambience is very nice, but the food is a bit bland, compared to other vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. But everything is very fresh and nicely served. On Saturday at lunch the place was crowded, people were even waiting outside to get a seat."
2,The coffee and breads here are superb but coffee temperature is below mine thoughts! All staffs are friendly....Ofen I go with my friends
2,"Simple beach joint. Relatively young crowd. The prices are ok, considering they really fill your white wine glass. A bit too uptight with the timing of the orders. We wanted to order fries but had to wait 8 minutes because they don't accept the order earlier than 12:30... nice and relaxing atmosphere. Just too bad the waitresses ignored us when we tried ordering drinks. The wines are ok-ish... waited too long for fries... overall we give it 3*..."
4,"So we wanted to check this museum out so badly because we had read so many good reviews and heard great things about their collections.  And then vacation happened and we almost ran out of time to see it at all.  But...we had to at least go see the special Dali exhibit that they currently have there.  So glad we did!  If you are a Dali fan, you will love this one.  I wish I could say I saw lots more of their permanent collection but I didn't.  We had to browse through in about an hour and that is nowhere near enough time to see it all.  We knew we were going to miss loads so we mapped out the major pieces/exhibits that we wanted to see the most.  If I make it back to Hamburg I will have to go here first thing and give it a proper tour.  They have a really lovely building and have built an amazing collection."
2,"The food was only mediocre and although the staff was friendly, it was clear most of them were inexperienced. We ordered a lot and shared the dishes:Rump steak (medium rare): this steak was undercooked (although I preferred it that way), it wasn't actually medium rare, but it was pretty good.Rib eye steak (medium rare): this steak was pretty tasteless.Caesar salad: had a weird flavor going on. Wasn't traditional caesar salad (in a bad way).Potato Wasabi Puree: interesting, but the charred avocado on top didn't do much.Grilled white asparagus: these were pretty good. Had a nice asian flavor.Marinated beefsashimi: this was mostly raw beef with a sear on the outside. There was some sort of fruit the same color as the meat, which was a surprise to bite into. This was interesting.Sashimi from loupnde mer (with grilled watermelon and san deniele ham): this wasn't so great. Didn't really work as a dish.Southern apple tuna roll (with tunasashimi, granny smith apple, avocado, basil, and soy caramel): this was pretty good. Interesting, but you couldn't really taste the apple, it might as well have been cucumber.Salmon Hand Roll: this was okay. It had a lot of mayo and not so much salmon.California Roll: decent. Nothing special.Chicken Skewer Yakitori: drenched in syrup, but the onions and chicken were okay. Wouldn't go back again, but it wasn't terrible."
3,"The french name and ""Cuisine Fine"" claim makes it sound like it's a fine-dining restaurant, which it actually isn't. But it doesn't matter, because the food is actually delicious and the service is friendly.We had a little bump at the beginning where it took them almost 30min to get us the drinks, but they were apologetic enough for it, even got us a drink on the house which is very rare in German restaurants where the service is usually terrible.A 3-course menu (goat cheese salad, burger with fries and creme brulée) costs 27€ which is very fair. The drinks are also good."
3,"Great buffet, can't wait to go again. Plan to workout after binge-eating on the delicious but oily biryani!"
2,"We've enjoyed our diner at the Parlament. The building is very spacious and has a nice and fresh ambiance. Diner was nice, not excellent or very special, but for us - tourists on the go - it was ok. We sat down pretty early (5:15 pm) and could be seated right away. Guests who arrived later had to wait al little while, but in a crowded city like Hamburg, that is something you have to take in to account."
4,"Einfach unglaublich köstlich, supernette Bedienung und ein urgemütliches Lokal. Volle Punktzahl!"
4,Comfortable and minimalistic place with a cozy atmosphere. Friendly waitress and nice coffee and chai latte. Definitely recommendable for a quick pitstop during shopping!
2,"So you telling me that chicken in chipotle sauce, beans, rice, salsa verde, creme freshe, rucola, tomatoes and onions, queso blanco and God know how many more optional ingridients on aflat bread are supposed to be a good food??? Yes, it doesn't taste bad, but I call it put all possible latin-flavoured ingredients together, name it Californian and sell in busy locations in Hamburg, Germany. Success guaranteed.I really hope people don't think this is Californian cuisine. I also hope that this trend (don't want to call it American, but looks like it's coming from there) of highly personalized, overwhelming choice food will fade away."
3,"If you are looking for upperscale German dining, you'll probably like this. The food was a bit funky for us Americans, but the quality seemed very good. I had the pork steak. The flavors were delicious, but a bit rich and salty. However, I think it just may be cultural difference. The view is of course amazing. The staff was super friendly and spoke English well. That's a big plus in Hamburg. We were going to a concert and wanted to eat close by. Well worth it!"
4,"Für preiswerte 3,70EUR gibt es hier eine Mahlzeit in Form einer gefüllten Backkartoffel. Diese wird mit Kräuterbutter und Käse vermengt und nach Belieben gefüllt. Besonders toll für Vegetarier! Houmus, Couscous und etliche tolle Saucen lassen das Ganzezu einem sehr leckerem und abwechslungsreichem Essen werden. Weil wir eine Zeit lang jeden Tag hier waren, haben wir das ein oder andere Getränk auf's Haus bekommen. Sehr nette Bedienung, obwohl das von Person zu Person ziemlich schwankt Auf die Kartoffel kommt es an! :) auf der Schanze ein Muss!"
4,Tasty pho.  it's quite good.  warm atmosphere inside. place gets full during lunch rush. we walked in and got last table at 11:30 am on a weekday so get there early.  I will definitely come again to try other menu items.
2,"Everytime i get non-german visitors we go to schweinske.it's an institution!! they have a wide choice of food, for very reasonable prices. Their salads are good, their hambrugers are good, their steaks and wurst are good! worth a try! Guten appetit ;)"
4,"The ""Strandperle"" is located at the beach in Övelgönne. To get here - you can take the ferry from Landungsbrücken or the bus from the main station (approx. 20 minutes). It is one of the best places to chill out in Hamburg. You can buy lots of kinds of drinks and some nice snacks at the ""Strandperle""."
4,"Since I moved to Hamburg, I have been searching for the best dim sum place for my weekend ""brunch"", of which I have been doing for years back in my home country. and yes, I am Chinese. I have tried several restaurants, Mei Moon is the real authentic Cantonese one. The owner and chefs are Cantonese, and they have the best taste bud within the whole China. Each dim sum is handmade in house, instead of mass production frozen pieces, which u can buy in chinese supermarket. Highly recommended for people who crave for a good Cantonese yamcha. Thumbs up for the food. However interior and ambient is better at dim sum haus around the corner."
3,"This museum was so close to our hotel that we decided to check it out first thing in the morning.  We were not necessarily looking for anything specific but also wanted to see what they had to offer.  One of the special exhibits was all about video/computer games and it was so cool!  You get to play arcade/console/computer games that you haven't even thought about for years (or maybe you have).  I am so glad I stopped in for that alone.  The rest of the museum is ok, and will be especially interesting to you if you are more into furniture and design.  If you are looking for more art, check out some other spots around the city first."
2,"As a New Yorker, I had to try a hamburger in Hamburg.  Fast food taken to a higher level.  The decor was modern and stylish, with great music and no paper/styrofoam here, real plates and flatware.The burger was good, not great or memorable, as were the sides.  Overall, a good experience and much better than any fast food alternative.  If you are looking for a quick, yet stylish, burger meal, this is a must try."
4,The best cafe in Hamburg!:) I love and miss that place! I lived in Hamburg for almost 9 years! The owners are a french and the service is very friendly. It's a cute small cafe in Hamburg Winterhude. It's very cozy. They have the best quiche I've ever eaten in my life! The cofffe is perfect and you have to try the Marabou chocolate pie! OMG! I always go there when I visit Hamburg!
3,"Had a good lunch at ROK during their quiet opening. The procedure is to take a pager at the front, order and scan in the back, they page you, and then you pay with the pager. A little complicated, to say the least. Had the special pizza of the day, which was pretty tasty (see photo caption). Prices were a little higher than normal, but the atmosphere is nice, and food is good. Will be back."
3,"The Kopiba is also known as ""Deathpresso"" Café.  It's their home brand coffee bean and is alsoactually the big sign outside above their entrance... so don't be confused when ppl tell you they'll meet you at ""Deathpresso""This leads us to the next fact: Kopiba is all about coffee and Espresso and they have an excellent selection of self-roasted coffees to have there and to buy. The staff is always willing to help you select the espresso bean that you want.It's a small café but intimate and cozy. On weekends they serve a breakfast buffet which contains just anything that you will need after your long night out in St Pauli.DO TRY their waffles!!!! They are absolutely amazing!!!"
2,"Indifferent staff, very contrived atmosphere, limited choice of drinks, not a fan really."
4,"A great Turkish lunch spot, with tasty food and incredibly fast service! I'm usually here atleast once a week for lunch. I really like the chicken with rice plate, and mixed sharp/yogurt sauce. The staff is really friendly; you can get by with English if necessary. Seating is kind of hard to come by around lunch, but they have mixed standing/seating areas. Even if you don't stay, there is someone always offering tea, which is such a nice treat."
4,"Amazing! this place has 5 stars on Yelp and deserves it. This place really goes back to the basics, you eat in a tent and the menu is on a chalk board. Very traditional German is served here. I had a Wiener Schnitzel with fried potatoes. When he brough my plate out I could not believe how huge the schnitzel was and how many potatoes I got.The guy did not really speak English but was very helpful non the less he made sure I like it and even asked a passerby to help when I ordered to make sure he got my order right!At the end he told me desert was included! I got rice pudding that was simple but good. I don't even know how I had room left to eat it.All of that and a drink and my whole meal was less than 10 euros!Go for sure if you are in Hamburg!!"
3,"Now, this is my kind of coffee bar. Stylish, modern but rustic-chic comfortable and clean. Fairly friendly service, accommodating to our group of 10 (reservation made prior) and quick with the breakfast, coffee and teas. My muesli with yogurt and fresh fruit hit the spot, as did my THREE cappuccinos. I had to restrain myself from eating the potted cheesecake for breakfast, but I so wanted to. The paninis also seem to be a very solid choice. The two larger communal tables are VERY sturdy. In fact a bit hard to get in and out of (as Aaron S mentions), but hey...they surely don't wobble or go uneven! A very nice spot to sit and chat. To read. To enjoy a light lunch or breakfast. Read the paper. Soak in a quick break before you tackle Hamburg. I will definitely return on my next visit. *cash only. There is a cash machine just outside to the right across the street. You'll be able to see it from the front door!"
3,"The burritos are wonderfully juicy, which makes them hopeless to eat, but you won't care. You'll be on the most wonderful journey exploring that burrito, one bite at a time, going deeper and deeper into a food-haze. Next stop: sweat pants city. I had the pulled-beef (soup?) with... um, everything.I do have some (minor) criticism:Burritos are made in front of your eyes, yet once they're done they are taken away for heating -- forever. Why? It's not even that hot once you get it.I'm also not a fan of the ambiance. I get it; ""it's a fast food place, it should look like it"". I'm not sure what it is, I think it might be the florescent lights in one end combined with the dark-ish-ness in the other; it makes my brain confused. I want the same warm fuzzy feeling that burrito gives to be confirmed by my eyes.Not that I'll be looking or even be aware once I'm halfway done. But still.This is the closest to ""Californian cooking"" I've experienced since my half year living there; a time where eating was one big blur, and I can't remember any particular burrito. But I do remember the feeling. It's the feeling of Qrito."
4,"Fantastic food, friendly staff who always remember a face, and reasonable prices (mid-range but for good portion sizes)! Bin begeistert!!"
3,Excellent cocktail menu with fun expert bartenders. If I hadn't smelled the bathroom it would have had 5 stars.
4,"Loved this place! Definitely the best Indian food we've found in Hamburg. I think you can't go wrong with ordering any dish here. Loved the naan and chicken curry. Definitely not a pretty restaurant and service here is not anything to write home about, so the food here is the star!I wish Germany had more of these types of restaurant options, where you order at the counter and pick up your food when it's ready. Easy, quick and cheap! Love it!"
3,"Had a blissfully wonderful evening at Brüdigams.  We came for the schnitzel, and were fully satisfied.  The restaurant is small, with walls covered in cookbooks, mismatched tables, and a small bar in front of the kitchen.  You can peek through the windows and see everything going on in the kitchen.  The service was lovely, relaxed, and present.  We ordered the minestrone soup and each our own schnitzel.  We were delighted at the small taste the kitchen sent out, which was rhubarb and fresh greens meant to be taken in one bight.  The bread brought my boyfriend back to his childhood because it reminded him of the bread his mother used to buy.  It came with olive  tapenade and we tried to save it for the soup.  The presentation for the soup was very nice, the bowl came out hot, with the two raviolis and a few spring vegetables in it, then the broth was poured on from a tea pot.  The broth was very tasty, but the soup lacked vegetables and any resemblance to a minestrone soup.  The schnitzel was fabulous.  Traditional, home made and tasted so fresh.  I had roasted potatoes with mine, while my boyfriend ordered a mashed potato/rhubarb mix.  Both came with ""grandmas"" cucumber salad. We were too full for desert.They offer a menu for around 30 euros where the guest can select an appetizer, main dish and dessert.  If we had been more hungry we would have taken them up on that offer.  There is also a prix fixe menu with seasonal selections on the first page.  Something I would also like to try. Like I said, we had a wonderful experience!"
2,"Firstly the most negative points I have about Balutschistan are not entirely their own fault. We took too many people, which rendered the sit-on-floor room very uncomfortable. This combined with the room being very dark led to me chipping my tooth (which I'm pretty pissed off about). Also with the room being so crowded (see photo) the waiters couldn't get in and the people in the middle of the room were only half tuned-in for passing things along. Yeah, it wasn't the greatest experience. Food-wise though the place was pretty good. I ordered a ""please make it more spicey"" lamb rogan josh and it came nicely spiced. The beers were decent and the service reasonably prompt, especially given that there were 20 odd of us. One downside is that the food is quite pricey by Hamburg standards. A curry and two beers came to EUR17"
4,"Had some excellent Königsberger Klöpse (meatballs) here at lunchtime with great mash potato and sauce. EUR5,90 for a small portion which was very filling. Quick, hot and very impressive. It gets pretty full in here at lunchtime so you may have to share a table."
4,One of my favorite cafes in the neighborhood. Dog friendly and gorgeous interior decoration and super friendly owners.
2,"Was waiting for my bus from Hamburg to Berlin and had some time to kill so I wanted a sit down to eat place instead of a form of takeout, I walked around the haubenhauf and found a string of restaurants and after looking at all the posted menus I decided I'd check out Nagel which is a German pub/restaurant, there is plenty of outdoor seating but I opted to sit inside which had plenty of tables and a good ambiance, they had a few different beers and liquors on the menu but I wasn't actually in the mood to have a drink so I opted for a water, for food I have their house salad which was good and had a dressing already on there, I ordered a schnitzel yet again which came with sliced roasted potatoes almost like potato du jour, the schnitzel I ordered came with horseradish sauce I decided to give it a shot and have a dish I really like prepped a little differently, it wasn't bad but I definitely prefer it with the sweeter sauce, overall this is a decent spot that's close to both hamburg's central station and also close to the bus station as well, I think I'd try another spot before trying this one again, not because it was bad but just because it wasn't too memorable to be honest"
3,"Kebap shop with a  much wider menu than just kebaps. Great outdoor seating with lots of sun; on a sunny day. Additionally, they give you a free salad and bread with your order. I don't know how the kebaps are but I got a dish consisting of lamb, a yoghurt sauce and little chunks of bread, topped with a pretty hot chili. Absolutely delicious. The yoghurt was just adequate to balance the powerful flavour of the lamb. The food also gets prepped very quickly. Definitely a fan of this place for a quick bite"
4,Delicious traditional food. Typical for the portuguese food is fish.We were in a group of six people and got our food all at the same time. Nice service. Price was ok. A reservation is highly recommended.
4,Best curry cuisine ever. I'm from London by the way. I became a regular customer now.
4,"Visiting from New York, it's not always easy to find great espresso bars in Hamburg. This is an excellent one."
4,"War etwas skeptisch ob der stylischen Einrichtung, ungewöhnlich für einen türkischen Imbiss, dient aber nur zum weiteren Wohlfühlen. Superlecker das Essen, frisch. Irre nett und gastfreundschaftlich der Laden. Optimales Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Da gehich bestimmt noch mehrmals hin."
0,I met the owner upon arrival. What a schmuck. Treated me like he was Donald Trump or something. The place was smokey and unfriendly. Image-conscious wannabes. Stay away. You can get a beer anywhere.
1,"Well,used to be better. Years ago I was here regularly. But CIU changed for the worse:Drinks: still a big selection. But just not good anymore. Wrong ingredients and somehow too watery.Service: leave me alone...Atmosphere: Too noisy, you just can't talk. Empty by 1am.Conclusion: Won't come again soon. There are better alternatives in Hamburg."
3,"Central Park is open!cozy nice placeA beach club in the middle of schanze! It's close to home, so i guess i'd be spending a lot of saturday and sunday afternoons there!"
4,"What can you say about experiencing something that people have to do in their day to day lives? an eye-opener? an enlightening experience? yes, these apply, but also added to this is a really well thought through few hours, and (is this wrong?) good fun. With comments from my group when entering into the pitch darkness of ""my sweetheart, you look nice today"" to falling over the marketstalls and basically being run-over on the fake street, we all had a great time. We learnt a lot by talking to our guides, had a beer in a pitch black restuarant and came out being a bit more broad-minded. a fantastic time, and well recommended to all..."
4,My two kids loved the joy of ordering on a tablet and swiping the meal themselves! Good food and good atmosphere. Will be back this week.
4,"I used to go to this place very often when I lived in St. Georg. A little hidden in a sidestreet next to the famous ""Lange Reihe"", this is the coffee shop to go on your walk around the district. It is small, intimate,  friendly and very cozy. The prices are okay. Not very cheap of course, but affordable compared to shops like Starbucks or Balzac (the latter is around the corner and by far the wrong choice). They offer a nice choice of small snacks, candy, soda, pastries and ... of course... coffee which comes in two sizes. Ever since I left Hamburg, I returned every once in a while only to find out that nothing has changed in Peaberries which definately is a good thing here.They have rather restrictive opening hours and only very little place for seating. I suppose it is more of a ""coffee to go"" shop. Many people chose to sit on the benches outside by the Gurlittstr. which happens to be quite a nice promenade near the Alster."
4,"UPDATE 28/04/2009: Been meaning to edit my review of JB for a while, as they've hugely upped their game a year on, and now serve what I think are my fave burritos in Hamburg. Also - the staff who work here are all ace. Last night we got treated to the Vicious Viper hot sauce (see photo), which is officially the hottest sauce in the world. Probably. ***** Passable burrito action slightly sparse on the sauce side of things, which is a bit ridiculous if you're paying an extra euro for guacamole. Still, they're nice enough and the place has a bit of character, along with these weird TVs from the back seats of cars stuck to the counter playing all sorts of weird films."
0,"I'm a native Californian.  I know Mexican food well. Sometimes I like it authentic. Sometimes I like it Americanized.  Being a native Californian it is likely I will eat Mexican food or a Mexican-inspired dish for at least one meal a day.  Which is why when I travel I find myself in Mexican restaurants in places like Germany or Scotland. I usually approach these places knowing that they will be pale comparisons to what I can get back home.  And it was with that in mind that I went to Jim Burrito. So when I say it was literally the worst burrito I've ever had, keep in mind that I wasn't expecting it to be as good as something from back home. What was so bad?  I got the Poblano covered burrito. The sauce tasted like dish soap. It was awful. The burrito's fillings were also very wet and lacking flavor. So basically I had a soupy soapy burrito.  The German friend I had with me tried a bite of my burrito after I refused to eat any more, and he also said it was awful.  As I looked around the place I noticed most people ordered the quesadillas. I'm sure that this much simpler recipe of cheese and a tortilla would have been a better choice, and should you find yourself dragged here by German friends, I recommend you keep it simple and order that.I think the most aggravating part of the meal though came when we went to pay.  We brought our dishes back to the counter, and in German the server/host treated us like we had offended him by not eating the awful burrito.  It was bad enough I had to pay for something inedible, but to be treated like we had offended them by not forcing ourselves to eat the awful meal, well that's just ridiculous.  I didn't make a scene, I didn't request the burrito be taken off the bill, instead I vowed silently to myself I'd write this review to warn other travelers away from this place."
2,"I have eaten here 3 times now, twice for lunch and once for dinner and to be honest my experiences have been fairly mixed hence my score of 3 stars.I agree with the previous review in as much as there seems to be too few staff for the customers. In the evening when you can eat at a leisurely pace you don't really mind waiting a bit but at lunchtime when you need to eat fairly quickly what should be a relaxing break from work can become a highly stressful situation followed by indigestion! (and a big bill) However, I did find that if you stress to the waiters that you are in a rush they do try and accommodate you.I cannot fault the food though, everything I have eaten has been fabulous with the arrabbiata being my favourite. If you have plenty of time to spare and a few extra pennies in your purse its worth trying it out for yourself."
4,"Probably the best vegetarian restaurant in Hamburg! Went there on recommendation by a local and was not disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious and the menu offers a big variety of creative dishes and drinks. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere nice and cosy. Highly recommendable, even for those who are usually meat eaters. If you're coming with a bigger group or around weekend, making a reservation would be advisable as it's highly frequented."
2,"The Neustädter Grill Meier is a no frills German fast food joint in the Wexstrasse, frequently visited by office workers in the area. It has all the usual menu items you will find at any other German Imbiss like Bratwurst (grilled sausage), Currywurst (sausage in a sweet, curry-spiced ketchupy sauce), Schnitzel, fries, Halbes Hähnchen (1/2 roasted chicken), potato salad but also other meals such as goulash with mashed potatoes. I mostly opt for the large Currywurst with Fries. Even though the sausage is not grilled (since this place doesn't have grill, everything is deep fried) it's good and the sauce (not self-made) also does it's work. Fries come in a well-sized portion and are hot and crisp. Those of you who want a no frills German Imbiss with acceptable prices should spend their lunch here. Unfortunately this place is closed on weekends, so I have to find another joint to satisfy my rare Imbiss cravings"
3,"Great Coffee, Muffins and Soup! I have not tried their other offerings, but this small cafe is full every day at lunch and throughout the day with people picking up coffee to go. Wonderful location right at the Hallerstrasse U1 entrance, Make sure to get a frequent buyer card!"
2,Basically currywurst in a different shape while sat at a table. the deserts were great though.
0,"The food is fine, but the service is so so so bad. I literally waited 90 minutes between ordering and getting my food. I've had two perfectly nice evenings ruined by coming here. Then again, it's always ram packed, so they're obviously doing something right."
4,"to echo another reviewer: hands down the best falafel in hamburg.it's also, miraculously, the cheapest: €2,50 for a basic wrap, €,50 for each additional ingredient, meaning you can get an enormous, overstuffed, insanely delicious falafel for the same price as a shitty, flavorless one at every other shop. i know which one i'd choose!"
4,"Perfect snack for a night out on the Reeperbahn. Came here late on a Saturday night and there was a line of hungry club-goers, and a nice man tending the shop solo that quickly filled all our orders. One a the best burgers I've had, and cheep too!"
2,"Kleiner Coffee Shop nahe der UBahn Hallerstraße mit wenigen Sitzplätzen, aber süße Inneneinrichtung. Die Preise sind ok (z.B. Caffe Latte Medium 3,20€).  Die Bedienung war etwas wortkarg, aber alles in allem kann man auf einen Coffee-to-go vorbeischauen wenn man in der Gegend ist."
1,"Disappointment. Seems I ordered the wrong food I guess. I paid €15 for the Lasagna with a side salad... Yuck. The lasagna was only pasta with the color red, no meat and only a slice of cheese on the top. Plus it smelled and tasted like fish. Do yourself a favor and order breakfast there. I even waited a day to write this to see if I would change my mind...."
3,"Great location, terrific food, tasty drinks. Very pricy but in total worth it. Do make reservations beforehand if you're interested in a table with view."
4,"Best museum I have ever visited and my background is in heritage preservation and anthropology so I have seen a lot of museums.Beautiful building which houses 10 floors of what used to be a private collection. The layout, design, and thoughtful displays are amazing! Great children's section on every floor where kids can interact with displays. Each floor is themed starting with cultures earliest interaction with the sea. Navigation, ship building, art, miniatures, sea life, a gigantic lego ship....sooo much stuff. This was one of the most pleasurable museums to walk around, it is serene and dim inside which really sets an amazing mood."
3,We went here for the second time. It is a great experience to walk through the rooms with a guide who explains the life as a blind person. You walk through different rooms and experience the life as a blind person. At the end you can buy something at a dark bar. It is a very special museum.
3,"I ordered the falafel-teller platter, which came with five falafel balls, humus, tzatziki sauce, and two vegetable sides. I chose cauliflower and chickpeas. The portions were very generous, so I was definitely full after finishing my meal.The cauliflower was my favorite part of the dish; it was spectacular, and I would definitely order this as a side if you come here. The falafel was good but not excellent -- I really enjoyed the texture (very soft yet crispy outside), but I didn't think it tasted as great as other falafel I've had (it was still yummy, though, don't get me wrong). Chickpeas aren't my favorite, so I don't know why I ordered this side, and I thought they were decent but not amazing (I enjoyed the tomato sauce).The tzatziki sauce was excellent (very flavorful), and I really enjoyed this along with the humus, which tasted great as a dip for the pita and falafel. The staff was very accommodating, and I liked the setup of the (small) restaurant quite a bit, with a variety of seating arrangements including lower couch-side seats. Overall, this restaurant had excellent service, atmosphere, and food, so I would highly recommend eating here. Although the falafel wasn't excellent, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and also saw some other great looking dishes around (including a fried empanada). I will be back here for sure."
1,"Nice bar a bit loud can't really have a conversation, we booked a table for 14 at 18pm  pm and at 21 pm was asked to leave even though we wanted to order more drinks, I think I won't be going back again , why would you ask people who ordered dinner and drinks to leave after 3 hours it's so unprofessional!"
3,"Came here early yesterday night between two apartment visits. The restaurant was approximately empty with only a single table occupied. It took about 3 minutes for the hostess to seat us which felt like an eternity. How many reservations can you possibly have on a Monday night to not be able to seat 2 people at 6 pm??Afterwards, the service quirks continued. For the first time since we arrived in Germany (~2 weeks), we dared to do the unthinkable: Order 2 glasses of tap water. We were not disappointed. At first the waitress made me repeat what I said, although I'm pretty sure that she perfectly understood the first time. Then she wrinkled her nose and went away. A little while later, the other waitress came back with 2 glasses of water on a tray and asked us: ""Is this what you ordered? Really?"" Haha, what a laugh! It is well known that German restaurants do not like to serve tap water and that they would rather sell you bottled water, however I was not expecting such an intense reaction. Anyway I thought it was quite funny and I can't wait to try this again in other restaurants.I had the grilled octopus which was amazing and my wife had the lamb souvlaki which she said was the best lamb she's ever had. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service: 4 stars overall. We'll be back if we're in the area, and we'll order tap water again."
4,By far the best Kebab I ever had. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. So is the service. The ideal place to spent afternoons with a good book and you diary. They also serve an excellent coffee.
4,"The Hamburger Kunsthalle is a great art museum. It has different sections for old masters, 19th Century, modern art and contemporary art.  There are amazing paintings from Casper David Friedrich, Max liebermann, Edvard Munch, Max Beckmann and a lot of other famous artists. I enjoyed the visit very much."
3,"One of the few good quality places on the Schanze. Not too big with a DJ inside, still it is not a club, but a bar. Cocktails are quite OK as well. It gets pretty crouded so make sure you go a bit earlier or around 10pm. They have a huge screen-bar where when you move your hand the animated fish reacts and starts moving towards your hand. It is quite cool."
1,"I think superchristine sums it up really. It is a great place for mid-30's single smokers who like to grind! It's not a great place (esp. upstairs) if you don't smoke, because you won't be able to enter without breathing equipment, and I don't even mind smoking! On a par with mutter there. On the plus side, it does have a nice BBQ and beer garden out back, and it's a bit off the beaten track, still, I don't really go here anymore."
4,"A must for all Greek-food lovers! And it is so affordable! I recently was in Rhodes and comparing the food there and here at the Taverna -- I would say it can't get any authentic than this! My first time here I ordered the Calamari + Chicken soulvaki along with the white house wine -- best combination ever! The atmosphere is great-- really reminds me of Greece also with the loud conversations. The staff are great! We arrived but no tables were available so we had to wait but I believe who was the owner came over and accompanied us and asked if we would like something to drink while we waited! We were then promptly seated and the service is also very speedy here. What I would recommend is the Greek Bifteki -- it is ground meat with stuffed feta cheese, I think it is named differently on the menu-- just ask the servers!!! And with almost every dish you can get either french fries or rice and a greek salad.One thing that made me laugh were the napkins cause on the other side it is a mini-greek dictionary for you with phrases that I learned on my Greek trip!!! On our second time around, again busy as ever, no tables but we were then again asked if we wanted something to drink! This time I tried the octopus salad and the Grill platter (with assrt. meats) -- GREAT!!! YUMMY!!! But one thing I shouldn't have done was eat bits of the bread they place on the table -- the servings are plenty -- so you can always eat the bread after if you are not full from your main dish!Note to self: This place is very affordable (our bill for both outings for 2ppl plus drinks(bottle of wine and beers) and tip came to 25euros) and great location in Schanze! There are plenty of selections of meat, fish, vegetarian, pizza, pasta and salads. They also have some sort of German special also, just look at the daily special board. Oh and did I mention there is also a huge tv screen for all those sport lovers who are supposed to be on a date but can't keep their eyes off the screen;) I am going to try the moussaka next time and the guy next to our table had some sort of sizzling plate -- will have to try that also next time!! And perhaps if you are a big group -- make a reservation! Oh yeah you get shots of Ouzo after you pay! And the bill is not paid at the table-- you go up to the bar!"
1,"Food was good but not worth the money. Service was relatively average and although the location of the restaurant is great, the place is rather dead.FOOD:Great menu! A lot of interesting options gives a very nice first impression. The food is good but completely overpriced. It lacks the nice spicy taste of asian cuisine and it is not very traditional. Also I've noticed some Vietnamese restaurants have started adding onion crumbs into their buns (yeah those you add to hot dogs and other junk food). Unfortunately my dish had that unwanted ingredient. Until this point I had already thought of giving the place a solid three stars; however, the dish was full of hairs and eye lashes which cost them a good rating.SERVICE:Slow, careless and unfriendly. Unfortunately these are the first words that come to mind after eating here. The waiter was way too serious and rather unhelpful. Showed no patience and just wanted to get the job done. Also although we were initially alone in the restaurant it took forever for them to take our order, bring our food and later to take our card. A change in attitude (or staff) might help this restaurant improve its service. LOCATION: Hoheluftchaussee is one of Hamburg's nicest places to go out for dinner. It is very lively and there is a lot to choose from. However this restaurant is rather spiritless. On a positive note the place is big making it perfect for big groups and spontaneous visits without a reservation."
4,"Have been coming here for many years - simple, excellent food.   My only complaint is that the price for the Normandy-Cider has become sort of crazy.     A small noise about a restaurant which remains high on my list.   Recommended for sure, especially for foreigners who think Flammkuchen is some variation of Pizza! (pfffffft!)"
4,The restaurant has more than just Vietnamese food. We had tasty Thai style curry dishes - a welcome break from wurst. Prices are good and the waiter is attentive.
3,"I went here for lunch with a coworker today and quite enjoyed it. Quick advice: try to come at an off-time! This restaurant is tiny, tiny, tiny--maybe only 3-4 small tables. We ate relatively late at 1 p.m., and we still had people eagerly waiting for our table.We both ordered the same thing--the grilled fish plate and a cherry soda. I don't know if anyone speaks English here because we ordered in German, but it would have been easy enough to just point at the menu if you can't speak any. We had our food in about 10 minutes  or so. The grill-plates were amply filled with a few different types of fish and a tasty salad. There was quite a bit of tartar sauce on the side, but I didn't use most of it because the fish was that good.Also, even though the restaurant is quite small, or maybe exactly because it is so small, I liked the ambience of this place. The stools were all well-worn, the tables tiny, and the street outside old and cobbled. Many of the restaurants in the neighborhood are soulless cafes and kiosks, so enjoy something a bit nicer here--though still not too expensive."
3,"Great place for American breakfast: pancakes with maple syrup, eggs&bacon, coffee. Very casual and cool atmosphere. Americana-mania reached Hamburg! A bit too loud and not cheap. Definitely worth going once in a while, but not the healthiest choice for regular consumption."
3,"I think this is the German equivalent of Outbacksteak meets Denny's. I do like their food and the service is lovely & accommodating but... I don't like to eat meat or cheese. So I have tried salads, chicken & soups. So basically I am not the best to give a review-my Tante lives In Hamburg and eats there at least1x per week. They feel it's a good inexpensive streak meal."
3,"ruehrei war lecker, orientalisches Fruehstueck haette groesser ausfallen koennen"
3,Tischreservierung total versemmelt :-/ aber sonst wie immer sehr gut.!!!
4,"RIB Happy Hour is awesome. 990 Euro for high-quality food. Forward: I walked by Jolie a few weeks ago and noticed two large guys rubbing their bellies after finishing off what looked like an entire pig. Both had plates stacked with bones in front of them. I asked a woman sitting outside(who turned out to be the owner) about the deal and she confirmed Happy Hour for Ribs on Wednesday, 990euro. Service: I returned for dinner last night. The owner was seated outside and seemed bothered that I was only there to eat food, not drink alcohol.  I was the only person in the restaurant so I would think my business would be appreciated. After a somewhat heated discussion about why I should order drinks whenever I go to any German restaurant, Claudia apologized and her smile came out, which was lovely. The waiter was young and jovial. Food: Dinner was great. Close to an entire rack of spicy-honey ribs, a small salad with sprouts, crispy potato wedges with sour cream and chives, and two pieces of perfectly grilled garlic bread. I don't even like garlic bread and I devoured the entire meal. A lot of food, a lot of great food for 990Euro. The ribs were overcooked in the slightest but not enough to warrant losing a star. The food was so delicious that it knocked the bad taste out of my mouth from earlier. I'll definitely be back with my girlfriend next week, and we will drink, and hopefully the experience will be even better."
4,"I'm from New York and was looking for a healthy place to get a salad and Daily You is by far my favorite place to eat in Hamburg. Everything is tasty, cheap, and high quality. The chili is very good. The salad bowls are all excellent. I've had both the teriyaki chicken bowl and tofu bowl and both were great. I'd recommend asking for them with lettuce if you want to skip the rice, but either way is good. The pasta bolognese is also very good and comes with an amazingly large portion of protein. The staff were extremely helpful (we only speak English) and the food came out fast. Would definitely recommend."
4,"Excellent authentic food and atmosphere, great and friendly staff who went out of the way to seat us two on a booked out Saturday evening. You would never guess what a treasure is hidden inside by the exterior of the place, or by the location... so keep it a secret;)"
3,"If you are in any kind of hurry, just go ahead and avoid this place. We had all the time in the world on Sunday morning so were okay with food taking quite some time. It's a neat little breakfast joint that reminds me of several places we've gone to and loved back in the States. We both got the 3-egg scramble with toast and home fries. My husband got tomatoes, mozz, spinach and mushrooms and I got sun-dried tomatoes, feta and spinach in mine and we both loved our dishes. Kinda nice that you can get as many veggies inside as you want! The jam served with the toast was delicious, as were the home fries. It was nice to see a menu with eggs different ways (especially eggs Benedict!). I don't even know the last time I had fresh OJ, so that was also a pleasant surprise! We both said we would come back here and recommend it to others, as well."
3,"Finally, Turkish food that's not döner!We had to go to Ikea and instead of having Swedish meatballs like we always do when we go to Ikea, we decided to venture out a bit. With a little help from Yelp, we found Köz Urfa. I'm thinking I will find more occasions to go to Ikea now because of this delightful Turkish restaurant. This restaurant is HUGE! And there's a cave area for more intimate dining. We arrived a little after 5pm, so the place wasn't very full up. The various kebaps are neatly displayed in large refrigerated glass cases. The dining room was bright and clean, and the staff is super inviting and friendly.I ordered the Urfa kebap while the hubby ordered the Adana kebap. I believe the difference was his was spicy and mine was not. For 11€ per plate, you get a lot of food. The meat is laid on top of a half and half bulgar and rice. You also get like 5 different sides and some grilled veggies, as well as a side of flatbread. I was not able to finish my plate, but I guess next time I'll come hungrier.I'm very much looking forward to coming back. There are so many dishes to try, plus all the dessert!"
4,"Delicious, affordable, healthy options, very friendly and nice staff, and the place is super cute and cozy! Highly recommended!"
4,Best coffee I had in Hamburg. Great service and coffee knowledge. Good help finding a filter coffee to my taste. Very high quality coffee and nice people behind the counter.Also a good place to buy coffee beans and brewing equipment. Eg. filters brewers and syphons. Highly recommended!
3,"Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot.Whenever we meet you're usually grumpy. People say you're lovely but to me, you're just grumpy.This crisp Winter morning though you smile. You manage to brighten up my day. And for the first time I can see why people speak so fondly of you.A narrow city beach. Blue skies. Large container ships passing by and merging with the dockyards' silhouettes for a moment. A beach bar, a hot drink. People chilling, sunbathing, walking their dogs. Or kids.Hamburg, you showed me your pretty side. I can stay here for a while."
2,"Your typical Irish bar. Probably the most authentic in Hamburg. Very traditional interior. Dark lighting so a good place to come and hide. Very friendly service. The beer's good. Location is easy to reach right on Grossneumarkt. There's outdoor seating during the warmer months. I've only tested some of their food and it was always good. Nothing spectacular but definitely enjoyable. The only thing I really dislike about this place is that at times it can be really full and there isn't that much seating available inside. Further, service can be a bit slow at times and is often pre-occupied with chatting at the bar as opposed to keeping glasses full. If you're into the Irish thing though a perfect jaunt for you in Hamburg."
4,"Located between Hafencity and the inner city, Ti Breizh restaurant is built around the little Brittany-themed 'House of Bretagne' clothing and specialities store.It focuses on - who would guess - galettes (made from buckwheat) and crepes (wheat), and its simple interior could be taken out of Brittany. The friendly and quick staff are even more original in their ""French coast"" vibes and striped clothing than those in Brittany itself, I would say??The food is really good: authentic, rich, buttery; nice cheese and a host of other toppings, and not too pricey. They don't serve the most fancy types of galette (like scallops etc.), so no dish is above 10€. (Keep in mind thought that no galette dinner is complete without a bottle of cidre and a crepe for dessert. This is not health food you came here for. Good thing that Hamburg, like Brittany, has beaches too to walk off that butter.) All in all, no wonder this place is exceptionally busy at all dinner / lunch hours: do book ahead."
4,"The best quality espresso bar in Hamburg. I used to live upstairs, so I was a regular. They have a very cute Instagram account, too! The layout is minimalistic and I love their blue espresso bar!"
3,"Fantastic burgers! Good service. Wonderful ambiance. Cool designs. Just a very joyful experience here at Shiso Burger. Had the Salmon burger with fries and a coke and after first taste i can easily say that Shiso is a place to go for a really fantastic fish burger and others as well.Only thing, the sits are not the coziest and the prices are a little high for drinks with a combo menu. Also wasn't the easiest place to find, but in the end, I still recommend and will go again."
4,"Authentic Italian restaurant that is said to be frequented by celebrities also. Wouldn't have wondered if I had met the Godfather himself there. You won't get served pizza, but tasty antipasti, pasta, and tiramisu. Luckily I didn't have to pay the bill!"
4,"I love this cafe. When I was there they played great music...David Bowie, some fifties music, some hip hop, very eclectic. They are open late on the weekends and have a full bar. St. Pauli is a nice neighborhood of Hamburg, and this cafe was super cozy. The vibe was very chill, the prices were fair, they had soy (soja) milk. I got the latte macchatio with soy cold and it was delicious. The Wifi is free, the staff is super friendly and young. The atmosphere is hip without being pretentious. I felt very comfy. They also have a lot of local events listed on the walls, and the staff spoke great English as well. Lots of cool german magazines to read. Some outdoor seating as well. And, its was fun to try the 'deathpresso'....Dont miss this spot"
2,"I ordered a plate of classic salad with rainbow bell peppers (triple color mix), tomato, grapes and extra avocado for €7.90 (which is equal to US $9.00). Look at the pictures and make up your mind, how fresh(!) their components are. As I tried to ask for explanation, instead of an apology I received an unacceptable answer. The lady at the salad bar was struggling to justify the reason why the avocado slices were brownish and mushy. She stated that when they cut them fresh this morning the avocados looked normal, we're talking from 14 hours later!!! What a great answer, another reason not to return, not to mention that they don't have sanitary service, no chance to wash your hands either."
4,"Alright... we knew this was the best always !!!Superb hospitality. Huge ballrooms and excellent catering. We had a fine experience visiting the interiors, not to forget the Phantom Room- where all the history of this hotel lies.. its my favorite...all time !!!"
4,"Located on the ""high street"" of Barmbek on the Fuhlsbüttler strasse small thai/chinese restaurant. In my opinion they make the best peking soup ever! Cheap but very good quality! Highly recommended!"
1,"We went here to get a nice lunch and it was quite of a disappointment.The pizza crust was definitely made from factory and the topping didn't taste fresh. We also got a oven baked potato with sallad and chicken and it was barely warm. I bet this is a great place to get drinks, based on other reviews, but DO NOT com here for the food - you'll regret it!"
3,"Good coffee,  sandwiches,  and yogurts close to Marriott Hotel and much better value. Plenty of space and friendly staff."
4,"The best Mongolian barbeque I've been to. Lots of choice of oriental starters, buffet main courses and the grill too. Also a great selection of desert dishes and ice cream. Very reasonably priced too.Friendly staff and a nice modern interior."
4,"Great little cafe on Schanzenstr. The coffee tastes as good as the place looks from the outside, which is to say, very good."
3,"The fried spring rolls had crispy perforated wrappers and a solid meat and vegetable filling. The sweet Thai chili sauce accompanying it was straight out of the bottle, but tasted better when tweaked with the house pickled chili and garlic on the table. The Summer rolls were tight and served sushi style. The peanut sauce that came with it was good.The Pho Bo (beef) broth was actually really good. Noodle texture and thin sliced beef were all excellent. And the shredded herbs added a balance and interest to the flavors. The fried dough stick was a lovely authentic homage to how Pho is served in Vietnam, and a fun dipping companion for the broth.Caphe s'ua da (iced coffee) was fragrant, espresso strong and served unmixed so you can see the seductive dark brown hue. But evaporated milk was used--refined, but I much prefer the sweetened condensed milk versions."
4,"One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Coffee was well brewed and their flat white really nice (comes with two tiny biscuits). Their French breakfast is really generous, with nice fresh bread, 7 delicious French cheeses with fig mustard and some red berry marmelade, and a truly airy and spectacular butter croissant. And their special out of menu Eggs Benedict were absolutely perfect. Really fresh, free range eggs, beautifully poached with yellow yolks and super crunchy bacon. Swoon. Already made a reservation for next week, as I am hosting guests!"
3,"Pretty cosy and comfy in here - once you were lucky enough to catch a free table. Then you can enjoy yourself pretty well. (Sadly advance bookings cannot be taken for Sundays as I was told a couple of times.)There's plenty of British traditional food on offer like (tiny) scones, pies and all sorts of tea. Also quite a selection of home-made cake but be aware of the large slices, deary me! But everything's lovely and definitely worth the visit. It's a nicely decorated (sofa, candles, paintings, walls painted in green) tearoom that makes one feel at home straight away. You can easily imagine three old British ladies sitting there gossiping away idlely and sipping their black tea. Well especially now that it's getting autumn and dark outside, Lühmanns is a great place for an escape. A possible walk around Blankenese and the water is a nice bonus as to the area. As the previous folks said too though, staff are always oh so slow and prone to forget orders. However they have as yet never forgotten about the billSo bring plenty of time & patience (and maybe a good book) and you'll be perfectly happy. I'd recommend it especially to anyone anglophile."
2,"Hier habe ich öfter ein kleines Frühstück genossen oder auf die schnelle ein Kaffee. Jedes Mal fand ich die Bedienung SEHR freundlich und hilfsbereit, das Essen schmeckte, und die Einrichtung finde ich nett und atmosphärisch. Leider habe ich heute die Minestrone bestellt.Die Suppe war dünn, und hell Braun mit kleine, oben-schwimmende Fettaugen. Grundsätzlich habe ich nichts gegen Fettaugen, wenn sie zum Geschmack beitragen. Nur diese Brühe hatte leider keinen Geschmack. Die bunten Zucchini Würfeln und sehr wenige Bohnen und Weißkohl Streifen konnten alleine die Braune Brühe nicht zum Leben erwachen. Knoblauch?  Fehlanzeige, Pfeffer?  Fehlanzeige, Salz?  usw. Seltsam finde ich es, dass die Brühe Braun war, und scheinbar nichts (Geschmacklich) mit dem Gemüse zu tun hatte.Nein, ich habe mich nicht Vorort beschwert aus dem einfachen Grund, dass ich wenig Zeit hatte und gar keine Lust hatte auf ein Grundsatzdiskussion über der Definition von Minestrone, und verschiede kulinarische Interpretationen davon.Das Erlebnis heute war enttäuschend. Ich hoffe, dass Engelke beim nächsten Besuch besseres zu bieten hat."
4,"mein erster eindruck: guenstig, frisch gesund und super lecker!!! hatte die nr. 1 (ente mit mango und minze): ein wahres (frisches) und originelles Geschmackswunder.toll, dass es dieses lokal gibt!!!"
4,Amazing pastries! Worth a U ride! Even the vegan cake was tasting so delicious and not the one where the taste buds get a leftover tast
0,"I would not suggest this restaurant and will never ever go there again. The foods are not fresh at all and the waiters are very unfriendly. AND i, and my mother got a stomachache right after!! It might be the worst restaurant i have ever been in this world!"
3,"Super location across from Abaton Kino in the University quarter of Hamburg, this Turkish restaurant is a favorite of students and movie enthusiasts. I have enjoyed lunches and dinners here for close to ten years and throughout that time quality and service have varied but during the FilmFest Hamburg, both were exceptional. A big bonus is the non-smoking section in the front of the restaurant, actually away from all the smokers. My spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo dough served with a green salad was hot, fresh and mouthwateringly delicious. Not only that, but when I flashed my press pass and said I was in a hurry, I had the best fast food ever. Many appetizers are enough for a good value meal, but as with most places, prices have gone up so it is not the bargain it used to be, particularly when it comes to drinks. The atmosphere depends on the customers as the place itself is unremarkable and at garden level (meaning limited daylight) but outside tables on a sunny day can be quite the treat. Open seven days a week from 9:00am until 3:00am with breakfast and special lunch menu."
0,Food and drinks are small and we encountered the RUDEST waitress on the planet. Don't waste your time or money
3,Enough has been written about this place. The food is great. I like the room because of the minimal styling. You can't beat the sushi in Hamburg. The location is easy to reach and parking is not a problem. My one major gripe about this place is the service. These are the most arrogant waiters and waitresses I've run acorss in Hamburg. They start to annoy you when you are making a reservation and they annoy through to the end until you leave. This really diappoints considering how good the rest is.
4,"We had a really nice dinner here during a quick trip to Hamburg.I like to start a steakhouse dinner with a classic cocktail (manhattan for me, martini for my date).  This place had a very good bartender on duty that evening.  The chopped salad needed to be a bit more 'chopped,' and it had a bit too much dressing but overall wasn't bad.  The meat was great.  I had Argentinian, because I prefer grass-fed beef, and my date had American.  Both were *perfectly* seasoned and perfectly cooked.  We would have liked to try the European beef (which is dry-aged), but the smallest cut was 900g or so?  seemed much too big.  The waiter explained the reason why the cuts were so big, but we couldn't completely understand.The wine list was extremely expensive, comparatively speaking, but seemed well chosen.  Service was very professional.  Beef:  it's a nice break from Hamburg Pann-fisch!"
3,"My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner - first birthday in Hamburg! I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience here. Located in the lovely neighborhood of Eppendorf, the restaurant is situated on a street near other shops and restaurants, but it's not super bustling. The setting is great for a nice intimate dinner for two or with a few friends.You get two tasting menu options for 108€. The differences in the menus are slight, with the first course and last course being different, otherwise all dishes in between are the same. We went with Nouri's Menu (that's the chef). The courses included the following:1. Foie Gras 2. Tartar of Beef 3. Couscous with 7 vegetables4. Monkfish5. Nouri's main course - braised ox6. Almond foam with mint granité and apricot7. Roses sorbetAll courses were plated beautifully! Each course was also bursting with flavor and the flavor combinations were quite interesting. I was definitely able to detect all the Moroccan influences. In regards to the food, I wouldn't say it was the best Michelin star meal I've had, but it's near the top of my list for overall experience, especially for presentation. If you have a few extra Euros sitting around, I'd recommend an evening at Piment."
3,"I ate here a few nights ago (on a Saturday) we were lucky to be able to reserve a table - booking is highly recommended. We visited for the traditional Bavarian experience, we weren't disappointed. Drinking litre beers from steins and feeding on schnitzels (huge) the evening ended watching the traditional Bavarian band and sinking a few shots of Jagermeister. Great way of experiencing the Munich beer houses in Hamburg."
3,"We stumbled upon Thämers during a frigid, windy Sunday, and it served as an excellent port during the storm. Though we didn't try the food, the Latte Machiatto and Pharisäer were just what the doctor ordered. Looking forward to trying out the terrace when the weather improves and upgrading to 5 stars! Kann es fast empfehlen!"
3,"We went to Witwenball for a special occasion dinner when some friends visited from out of town. Overall, the space is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is good. I think my only real complaint is that the pacing of the meal was extremely slow (for my taste)."
3,A pretty nice place for beer and food and a great place to sit outside in summer.
2,"Went here last night with a few friends after developing a craving for Mexican food. Overall a solid experience.PROS+ Burritos: grilled in a panini press and finished in the oven. Huge size, and very cheesy. Definitely satisfied at the end of the meal. The grilled chicken had a good seasoning to it, and the dish was improved by the two varieties of habanero sauce. + Service: our waiter was very attentive and pleasant, and answered the questions we had. Service was prompt. CONS- ""Nachos"": are essentially a plate of grocery store chili-lime flavored chips that tasted like they were dumped out of a bag. These were then topped with a sprinkling of pico and a few pickled jalapeños. Served with a small side of guacamole, which wasn't that flavorful. - They have tequila bottles (a decent variety as well) at the bar, but no margaritas. Was very disappointed in this. RATING3.5 / 5. The burritos were great, but wouldn't bother with the nachos again. Would likely check out other places before returning."
4,"I was lucky to get to visit the Exhibition 'Mahjong;' in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. This was an extensive exhibition that was curated with the highest calibre. The exhaustative exhibition told truths about China from approximately 1979 to 2005 through the work of many chinese artists. On entering this exhibition the first piece reduced me to tears and of course frightened my pal who ran off to hide in the toilets. The piece featured a giant sized wallet that framed video footage of the production of wallets in sweatshops, slaughter houses and high street designer stores. The video footage was also complimented by very sad violin music. The rest of the exhibition was a weeks worth of viewing, and expressive pieces that told us truths about China. We were educated with hard hitting expressive modern peices. The final pieces I viewed were some Mao propoganda graphics. I think this exhibition at the Hamburger Kunsthalle was one of the most outstanding of exhibitions I ever visited and i would of course always be interested to know what goes on in the Kunsthalle."
4,"Lovely food! Cosy atmosphere!We wanted vegetarian food, but don't speak German too well...The waitress however spoke excellent english, and gave us some options instead.We ended up with some amazing antipasti, and delicious truffle pasta.I can also highly recommend the Creme Brulee ;)Also looked to be a great fish selection, and would love to come back and try it!"
3,"Very friendly waiters and pleasant atmosphere. Some Dim Sum were tasty, some you need to get used to. But if you didn't try out Dim Sum before, this place should be a good start."
3,"If the lamb is on special and you are an eater of lamb, I implore you to take it. This is the reasoning I used and left highly sated in terms of red meat levels and happiness factor. The service was lovely, especially in regards to keeping wine glasses full, explaining the menu (going the extra kilometer to explain in english the specials), providing quick translations and overall just being very pleasant and excited about the experience. My lamb with veggies in a mint/thyme sauce was elegantly plated and the taste surely matched the looks. A medium portion, just enough to fill up but not be overly full. The cinnamon rice I snagged from across the table was also quite a treat...savory sweet. We had a range of appetizers, the standouts being the falafel and the red beet paste. The dipping sauces for the bread were a bit bland, and the other starters quite small (more like tapas, but smaller) so a bit hard to split amongst the group easily. A lovely dinner for our group of 7. Half German, half American. All happy. *reservations suggested. *cash or German EC only. Total: 200 euros with tip. Not bad at all for the quality and panache of the evening."
4,Excellent cakes and hot chocolate/coffee. Really chilled and a great place to pit stop whilst exploring Hamburg. Highly recommend!
3,"Oh, this place is so great! It's a spice museum!You can find plenty of information about spices, their origins, their usage and how there were and are imported. The space is actually in the Speicherstadt, the largest warehouse district in the world, located right in the port of Hamburg.The museum itself is in a warehouse that used to belong to a spice trader, so it's the perfect location for a museum dedicated to educating and advising people on the origin and usage of spices. There are over 500 years of spicy history in this museum! You can touch and even taste over 50 different spices throughout the museum. It's an amazing visit for anyone who is interested in food preparation, history and spices.Also, the entry ticket is a bag of black pepper, so you're getting something out of this visit in any case! You can also buy spices and spice mixtures after your visit. I've been back many times and absolutely love it."
3,"The Delta Bistro is really in quite an odd place! You'd be forgiven for thinking you were actually walking into a factory, because, well, you are! It's on the first floor of some sort of cash and carry which is part of the meat market here. You'll be walking down a deserted street that's fairly badly lit with parked lorries stacked on the pavement, and getting a little bit lost before you find it. Upstairs, the seating is very spacious, and the service, although not fast, very professional. Both starter (carpaccio de boeuf), and main (rib-eye steak) were excellent, and the Austrian wine we ordered was very drinkable too. I would tell you how much it cost but my date for the evening paid for everything too, what a bonus!"
4,"Long live Sommersalon! My friends and I love this place. The music is a great mix of funk, hip hop and R&B - old and new school. The DJ's will stir up some James Brown with Kanye and throw in some Rolling Stones too. It's a really cool vibe. No fancy drinks, but who needs them? And absolutely no mind-numbing, repetitive techno beats. It's never our first stop, but we always end the night there. The dance floor is jumping after 1am. The place itself isn't so pretty, and it gets really crowded but you'll have a good time. Ladies - take tissues. They are always out of toilet paper."
3,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a while back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have to like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Recently for example had the coconut milk and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
3,"The food here is great. It's tasty (strong flavors), varied (so many options), fast, and inexpensive. I love coming here for a quick and casual lunch.It's worth explaining the system at Vin O Vin if you've never been, because it's a little complicated, but definitely worthwhile:1. Walk inside, and tell the nice lady behind the counter what you'd like to eat. If you're new, try the small pasta plate (which is quite big), and you can basically choose from 3-5 pasta options and about a dozen vegetable and side dish options in any combination. You can also order meat options (costs extra) like a piece of chicken or some meatballs. 2. The server will make up your plate as you choose things, and when you're done, she'll hand it to someone to be heated up. (This is the part that's a little awkward, because you might expect to just take the plate and start eating. But it's worth the wait.)3. Find a table to have a seat, or if it's crowded, one of the waiters will help you. There's some nice outdoor seating in the summer. One of the waiters will take your drink order once you've sat down, and will bring some bread for the table.4. A few minutes later, a waiter will deliver your food nice and hot for the eating. 5. Return to the far side of the counter to pay for your meal. Just tell them what you ate/drank, and they'll ring you up.Guten Apetit!"
4,"This is place is GREAT, you can definitely tell it from how many Asian show up here. I love the fried chicken here , so juicy. Miso ramen and soysauce ramen are both good. The highball was in a wrong glass but tastes good. Finally the desert, mochi is my favorite, and I can't wait to try mocha ice cream next time."
3,"Very much Italian ran and very, very good. Although you sit inside, most of summertime business happens just off the sidewalk. I have even watched a dude ride up to the counter on his bike, order, pay and leave--all without bothering to dismount. Overall, if you happen to be in the area--and are jonesing with the 'you scream I screams'--by all means stop, walk or roll in for a cone. If are on a quest for the 'Best in Hamburg', Eiscafé Veneziana will at least make the short list."
4,"Best Greek food in the city!Run by the real Greeks who put their hearts not only to the food but also to welcoming the guests and giving the best experience possible! I have visited a few Greek restaurants in HH and this is far the best one. The meat is fresh, well seasoned and never dry. Gyros and calamaris are my personal favorites. The portions are large and the prices are low :)"
2,Fast service. Decent food. Nothing special but delivers what is expected. Caesar salad was more dressing than salad. My kids loved the place. Go figure.
4,"Startlingly good French food, right in the center of Hamburg.  Stopped in here a few weeks back with some coworkers, and quickly settled on the Menu (prix fix).  The appetizer was an easy choice --- the house-made pâtés (""Duo von hausgemachter Pastete"") included both a rough-ground one and a chunkier country-style version.I was thrilled with my chicken special --- rich, savory, and completely unlike your average American chicken dish.  Excellent potatoes rounded out the skillet of deliciousness.  One of my companions was underwhelmed by the rockfish (""Steinbeißer"") catch of the day.Dessert was again an easy choice; the ""Crêpe ""normande"" mit Calvados"" (apple crêpe with apple brandy) was delicious, if twice the size I needed.Wine choice was as extensive as you'd expect from a good French place, with a reasonable by-the-glass selection.Definitely a must-try for a nice meal out in Hamburg.  The waiter was comfortable in German and French, but less so in English."
3,"When you are up for a brunch with a twist, that's the place to go. And the twist is middle eastern/mediterranean, yamm! Inside and outside, as previous posters wrote, it's nothing special. Probably pretty boring bar. But believe me, exciting brunch! Honestly, I'm tired of these endless pasta salads. Not in Chakra. Along with brunch classics like cheese and sussages, omlette, salmon, there are also baked aubergine, tabouleh, hummus and other spreads. Olives, fetta cheese, all sorts of antipasti are there too. It's reasonably priced and I have no complaints about service."
3,"Met an english group here a few times, solid service considering there were so many of us, close to a station as well."
3,"Delicious Pakistani food and great service (which is completely unexpected in Germany!) This is one of several locations in the city and my favorite because you can either have a nice sit-down meal in the gorgeous restaurant or have a quick meal in the little ""imbiss"" (snack) on the right side. The restaurant is beautiful with carved wood, lit candles, tiled walls and flooring, and the choice of sitting at tables with chairs or on cushions on the ground. In the snack side you can order from essentially the same menu although it it much cheaper  and a little quicker. Great curries and platters, yummy cocktails, and quick and friendly service. Definitely recommended."
2,"I was unimpressed by this place. Had wanted to come here for a while as I had heard good things. Well, we finally reserved a table and tried it out. Nice location, ok ambiance and fairly nice staff. Yet, the food is totally mediocre. There is nothing special about it and even though the menu changes on a regular basis, we found it tough to find something we ""really"" wanted to order. Almost left because of this but had a go at it anyway. Oh well, we should of maybe left yet then I wouldn't of known how the food was.We won't be back but maybe it's just not our thing. It was really full and this on a Tuesday night. People do seem to like the place and in general it is good. Yet, if you're here for the food, I'd go elsewhere.Finally, I ordered a souffle for dessert. After coming out once and telling us it collapsed and there were going to try again, they brought out a failed attempt. After two tries, they couldn't get it right. Hence they brought one out which was all over the plate. It still tasted fine but to be honest, I would of simply said, ""hey, we can't get the souffle right tonight....have something else and it's on us!"" This alone would of had me come back to give them another chance. Yet, nope, they basically said we can't get it right so eat it this way....regardless of the poor presentation of the dish.I know this is nitpicking but it's why I go to restaurants and don't cook for myself at home. The ""show"" is part of the reason I am willing to pay higher prices. Oh well, we'll find something else I am sure."
3,Excellent pizza and lunch special combination! I ordered the vegitarian pizza and it was absolutely delicious and only 4euro. I was really suprized with the quality and the size of the pizza. The service was super quick too!
3,"We went here on a busy hot sunny day last week. We would have walked right past it, but my 8 year old daughter saw it and was capitivated. So we paid for a family ticket expecting to just walk up and down the deck, go to the loo then get off. How wrong! The ship is brimming with interesting things about itself, the original merchants who commissioned her, how the crew lived, lots of artefacts plus all the lower decks and cabins left how they would have been in days gone by. There is also a nice looking restaurant deep in the heart of the ship. We really enjoyed our 90 minutes on there and regard it as one of the highlights of my family's week in Hamburg"
4,"This place was great. I kinda had a mini overload. Fun for all ages young and old. The pieces they have are of historical, modern and imaginative. I'm  from Los Angeles California, and went to Hamburg for business. On a day I had off I came across this great gem of a tourist destination. I would like to come back and see new displays they come up with."
4,This town hall is really impressive with its architecture and interior inside.  Felt a bit like entering a church rather than a town hall.  Highly recommend to anyone to look at.
1,"This place has mediocre food at best. Been here twice now, hoping the second time it would be better. Oh well, not the case. Service is slow and fairly uninterested. Had to more often than once get up to get the attention of the waitress. Further, I find the ambiance to be pretty boring and not even that authentic. Finally, the food is average at best. I really couldn't say I found it tasty at all. It wasn't bad I guess but I simply expect a lot more from Greek food. It's not that hard to get right, especially the grill plates. They used poor quality meat as well which was really disappointing. Won't be coming back here again."
3,"Reliable old standby for me in Hamburg, as I find myself there at least once a year.  Excellent menu, nicely prepared & presented.  In St. Georg, which has a Villagey, Bleecker/Christopher feel. Decor & atmosphere remind me a bit of Odeon back home in NY."
4,"Don't skip this. Bigger than you think, with lots of attention to detail.  Easy access. Not suitable for wheelchairs (in my opinion) and the scenery switches from day to night very regularly. You can also have a view behind the scenes."
1,"Very nice location and the food is good (if they still serve it). Having said this, the service is just not able to keep up with the demand which shows the lack of concept: Only some service personal is allowed to take orders/payments whereas others only serve as ""food/drink carriers"". Thus, getting attention of one of the few ""higher ranked waiters"" to order or pay is just nearly impossible. Due to bad attention to the tables people stand in line right at the kitchen door to order or pay. This results in the other guests receiving even less attention. Furthermore, they stopped serving breakfast at 11am on a Sunday due to the kitchen not being able to keep up with the amount of orders. Final conclusion: Nice location but due to the incapable personal only recommended if you have a lot of time and a high level of frustration tolerance."
2,"Quite expensive, waiters try to sell you most expensive food without prices. Nice atmosphere and chic. I would go there again, but oder less food."
3,"I stopped in after ready all reviews, I code the Eva's chicken burger with cheese, reminds remoulade  sauce and potatoes,  everything was great, potatoes were cooked perfectly, the chicken burger was perfectly cooked and the best part was the remoulade sauce.  I really recommend this quaint little place."
3,"This is my first Vietnamese restaurant in Germany. It's a cute little restaurant with outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has metal dinning tables with small plastic stools reminiscent of restaurants in Vietnam (which I have just spent 3 weeks in prior to coming to Germany). The green tea is the traditional Vietnamese green tea that I love. I also had the shrimp spring rolls (summer rolls) that came with a fish sauce dipping sauce. The inside is filled with veggies and the very thin vermicelli noodles. Very tasty. I also had the beef pho. The usual hoisin sauce and the plate of vegetables on the side was not served with it like I am used to in other countries (US, Vietnam, etc) but the broth is very flavorful you almost don't need it. The beef is served medium rare over the boiling hot soup. It was kind of chewy but overall still good."
3,"After a visit and concert at the Elbphilharmonie we dined with a group in the private dining room. The food and service were excellent. Don't expect cutting edge food, just beautifully cooked and presented classic French cuisine, a salad starter , a slow cooked beef daube with herbed potato mash and a sublime creme caramel. Coffee was a caffeine hit short black. Wines matched well."
0,"What to expect from a copy of  world-famous tourist trap. Being from Bavaria myself and loving Bavarian food  this is one of the few places in Hamburg to get some. We went to get ""schweinshaxe"", a classic. (Grilled pork shank). First, instead of the typical bread dumplings, it comes with potato dumplings, ok, small issue. But the true dissappointment was the Haxe itself. It was dry and the crust (the best part) was hard as a stone. My feeling is they had put too many on the grill and just warmed up the leftover ones from yesterday, poured the fat over it and sold it as fresh. My mother in law had the pork roast, which had no crust whatsoever and was dry as well. These people are ruining the reputation of Bavarian food! its a Tourist trap. You want the real deal? Go to Munich, at least its the original trap. To be fair, I had a decent Haxe before, at the Speersort -branch of the Hofbräuhaus. But there the waitress was so unfriendly that I did not want to go again. Bad choice, obviously. I'd rather handle grumpy waitresses than bad food. I really hope for them it was just a bad day."
4,"This is one of the largest and most well maintained museums I've ever been to. Absolutely an essential part of your trip to Hamburg if you're even remotely interested in anything maritime related. This includes vikings, trade routes, slave trade, explorers, war ships, cargo shipping, harbour building, pirates, marine animals, fishing, treasures, ship wrecks and much more! The exhibitions stretch over nine stories with additional smaller exhibitions on various sub-floors in between. We didn't have enough time to visit every single room, but everything I saw was super well presented, interesting and dynamic.There are tours at various times in various areas as well as presentations throughout the different floors. We happened to walk in on a presentation of a container ship simulator that let you slowly, painstakingly experience what it's like to drive a large container ship along a canal leading to the harbour. It's slow. It's arduous. I thought it was incredibly boring (the simulator, not the presentation) but apparently people spend hours at home playing with these simulators. And enjoy it. For some reason.I loved the miniature ship exhibition. Thousands of miniature ships spanning several centuries of ship building and design. The piracy exhibit was also quite interesting, while the rooms on the slave trade (including a piece of an actual slave ship showing shakles and chains) and plague ships were quite harrowing though still really well presented.All the history of human activity on the seven seas seems to be brought together in this amazing building. The cafe downstairs is also reasonably priced for a museum cafe and very beautifully designed. We really enjoyed our trip to this museum."
4,"I really enjoy my lunches here. Ti Breizh is a traditional Bretonian eatery, complete with striped shirts and maritime decor, which serves nothing much else other than Galettes and Crepes. The menu is very diverse, ranging from light Galettes (with cheese and egg) to the heavier ones (various sausage-type toppings), and for dessert there's a scroll-long list of every type of crepe combination imaginable. Brown sugar, maple syrup, chocolate, ice cream, whipped cream, apple sauce - if you can think it, Ti Breizh make it. Granted, this is probably not the best place to go with a large party, as the kitchen is only capable of making 4 galettes/crepes at a time and it will take the food a little longer to arrive to a big table, and the prices aren't the cheapest in the area. You can, however, get an affordable lunch menu if you arrive at lunchtime and the combinations on the lunch menu are normally diverse enough to include something for everyone - including a cider or a cup of coffee. Very recommended!"
3,"One of those cafe's that you don't find that often. Small, nice and calm feeling. Almost as stepping in to a livingroom. The coffe is great."
3,"+ Tasty German-French Fusion cuisine, + nice view over Hamburg Harbor, + recommended for business dinners, special occasions, and private eventsThe Carls belongs to Hotel Louis C. Jacob and convinces with the same outstanding quality. Although located in the hot spots of Hamburgs' new harbor city Carls is attracting the casual foodie. Its interior uses elements from French brasseries and bistros including a full French loaf as starter. At the Brasserie guests can choose between leather booths facing the restaurant's inside and the Elbe River or tables next to the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river or the new Elbphilharmonic. The menu includes a German-French fusion cuisine and a comprehensive wine list (EUR 20 - 390 with an average bottle price of EUR 40). If listed I recommend to try the cold vichyssoise (actually the best I ever had) in combination with 'Carls Fass' a dry Riesling.Be cautious ordering their water flate rate, which isn't a real flat rate since every carafe is finally balanced on your check! The average costs per person, including drinks are about EUR 65 if you order a la carte or choose a prix fixed menu with wine. People on a budget don't have to refrain from the delicious food since Carls' Bistro offers affordable small plates from EUR 5 - 13 and wines from EUR 4 - 6."
4,"It's a wonderful, quaint little restaurant.  The staff was friendly and helpful with understanding the menu.  My German is nonexistent.  The entrees change weekly and the dish I ordered was full of flavor.  The appetizers were authentic and tasty.  Overall it is a nice place."
4,Good and cheap place to eat kumpir. Great variaty of kumpir. Big sizes and good prices.
3,"A very trendy place. A big plus is that they have homemade patties and you can choose what kind of bun you want. I whish that the patties tasted a bit more tho. They are in need of salt and peppar. I have only had take-away and the concept is great! You choose your type of burger, then buns and side orders and when we waited for the food we got free beverages. I have never eaten at the restauran but I would say it is worth a pop-in."
4,Loved the hipster vibe + the awesome coffee. Friendly staff and generally great atmosphere. Would have come back for more if only I had stayed longer in town!
3,Gemütlich freundliche Bedienung und außergewöhnliche leckere getränke zu guten preisen!
4,"After going there for few years, I have to admit that, this is a decent place to go for Chinese - Taiwanese ( southern homemade food style) place. It is not a place for spicy food ---  there are large group of Chinese who don't eat Spicy food !!! :) It is more southern style --- definitely! the Good thing is: when there is a big travel group eating at the back, you will have a chance to order those ""long time prepared "" dish !!! I will come for sure again ;)"
0,"The Viale Antico was a nice little Italian place that we used to frequent on a regular basis. Unfortunately due to multiple circumstances I'm now re-classifying it as a 1 star restaurant. It may well be a victim of it's own success. They've got a lot more customers now, but no more staff. In fact they have less staff, and they've put the prices up! The waiters are generally incompetent. Today we were seven people. The first two meals came, then we waited 5 minutes for the next two. We had to wait a further 20 minutes for the last three, while repeating our order for three separate waiters. When the last three were finally ready they were sitting on the counter for a few minutes with no-one to bring them over, so one of the chefs motioned to us that we should just pick them up ourselves If this was the first time that I'd had such a bad experience I'd let it pass, but they were almost as bad the last time (1 month ago). I just can't let it pass. The food is still decent, but it's definitely not worth the experience that comes with it."
1,"Wir wollten gestern Hotdogs bei Miss Sofie essen  um 12:30 haben wir die Aussage bekommen, dass diese nicht vor 13 Uhr warm sein, wenn die Bedienung jetzt anfangen würde. Das Eis war die letzten Male sehr lecker (dafür die zwei Sterne)  aber bei einem von zwei Besuchen waren von den zwei vorhandenen Softeissorten (Schoko und Vanille) nur eine vorhanden :-(. Und teuer ist es auch noch. Grundsätzlich eine tolle Idee, aber irgendwie hapert es noch an der Umsetzung."
4,"Very new, and very modern steakhouse located very close to the central train station.The menu is excellent and the staff tried their best to keep up with my rusty German; and helped by attempting some English which is always appreciated. The menu was good, with an excellent range of steaks and meat; all served with garlic bread, salad, fries or a potato - they even have a kids menu if thats your thing.They also had a good range of desserts should you have space left after your main.Steak was well cooked, excellently seasoned and delicious. My ice cream was good, although it did melt fairly quickly due to the restaurant being a little too warm.Service was laid back, fairly slow making for a leisurely dinner where you could enjoy your food.Prices were reasonable and my main + drink + dessert came to roughly €25 with tip included so better value than other steakhouses nearby.I recommend checking this place out if you want a good steak for a good price and with excellent service."
4,"Fantastisch und wirklich kaiserlich. Sehr geschmackvoll und mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet. Die Speisen sind authentisch schmackhaft und die Besitzerin (eine echte Österreicherin) sowie die zauberhaften Mitarbeiter/innen im Service sind bemerkenswert aufmerksam und sehr kompetent. Dieses Kleinod mit herrlicher Sonnenterrasse in der Hafencity habe ich für mich entdeckt und empfehle es allen, die den Standard satt haben und das Besondere unserer Tage suchen."
4,Boys and girls if you like rock music and if you are looking for one of the best rocking pubs in hamburg this is the place to go!
2,"The beer is the star here. To my palate, it's distinctive across the three brews offered, each having a very aromatic, herbal quality. The food is solid German brew house fare with a twist. There's a curry-laden Thai soup that's delicious and a German ""tapas"" plate featuring mini-schnitzels, rõsti and wurst. The canal-side setting is quite nice."
3,It's all decorated with Mexican wrestling accouterments and the burritos may not be California (or Texas?) worthy but they're better than anything you'll find in New York City.
2,"A very good restaurant! Wee bit posh, but I liked it.However within Hamburg competition it's not outstanding.Location: Perfect. The place is located in great place and also inside it's clean, posh and kind of romantic. I liked the music on this Friday evening very much.Food and Drinks: Wine list is average. Nothing really special. Wine quality is very good.Food was my biggest disappointment. The Beef tartar was done in a very unique way. There was a bottom layer of a spicy sauce. Not my style, as it was not possible to taste the tartar itself. Fish for main dish was excellent. However the side dishes (KartoffelSCHAUM) was just marketing. Simply potatoes were served.Service: There is room to improve. Especially with the white wine and how to pour which wine in a glass. I've to admit the young ""main waitress"" was perky in a positive "" Hamburger Deern"" way.  Overall: If you around it's a place to visit and enjoy dinner."
4,This is our regular as well as special Sushi place in Hamburg. Always an-above-average quality and never tiring variety of sushi :)
4,"Awesome place for super-competent cocktails including a few finds and specials. It is hidden away off the main Kiez strip in a residential block, and not a hip nor cool place. All the better!The drinks are stiff and their quality undisputed. And you won't go wrong simply ordering your favorite drink here for a 'how it should always be' version of it."
3,"nice burrito place in the Grindelviertel. I've been to the one at Osterstrasse before, but here it was a little more complicated to order your burrito with your choice of all the different toppings. Kinda like ordering a subway sandwich. But my burrito was pretty tasty. The should have some sauces on the table, however, and I didn't like my friends' Guacamole too much."
3,At the La Piazzetta we got good pizza. I ordered some take away as well. The staff was very nice and the food was good. On top of the pizza we had some pasta and salad as well. The interior is cozy and decorated with Italian themed and soccer themed photos. Enjoy
4,"Excellent Vietnamese restaurant in Hamburg?! Who'd have thought it? This is a low-key, friendly establishment, which is reasonably priced and has delicious food. The staff are so friendly that when our credit card didn't work they said, just pay next time! When does that ever happen?! Starters and mains for 3, including wine, comes to around EUR70. Recommended."
2,"Very nice place but I feel like for the price I payed the amount of food was a bit poor, but tasty"
4,All the tourists that visit Hamburg have to see the Rathaus (town hall) of Hamburg. It was build 1897 out of granite and sandstone. The roof is made out of copper. Just go in the city center of Hamburg and you will see the magnificent building. Secret hint: Between the windows you can see the 20 kings of the old German empire. Another hint: Find within the inner yard the fountain Hygieia-Brunnen that was made in memory of the victory against the cholera epidemic in 1892.
3,"It seemed only fitting, being Australian and all, to go to the 'Down Under' bar to watch Deutschland Vs Australia in the Football. I must admit, I was a little scared. I was anticipating a horribly tacky, over-done museum of typical Aussie icons plastered on the walls with a sound track of Steve Urwin saying ""Crikey"" over and over in the background. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that although there were typical Aussie icons present like digeridoos and kangaroo signs, it didn't feel over done. It didn't feel like 'home' but it felt good. I think the menu was comical rather than accurate...I don't actually think in reality there are too many typical Australian dishes. But they did a great job to have kangaroo on the menu. Please eat them- they are a pest! I had a chicken burger that came in a baguette. Once again, I don't know how Australian that is but who cares? It tasted good! We had friendly service from the bar staff and waitresses which IS typically Australian and to me, more important. It was a great atmosphere to watch the game in. Australians and Germans together got to witness the thrashing. All in all, a great night."
2,"Jimmy Elsass is supposedly the number one location to satisfy one's Tarte Flambée cravings in Hamburg. After having heard of this almost legendary venue for years I finally got around to actually visiting it - and was just a wee bit underwhelmed. The interior is decorated in typical students pub style (which is supposed to be no distinct style at all) - lime green walls, old fashioned seats, dim lighting and oversized plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling (and hence obstructing the way for taller guests). Some might find it charming and genuine, I however wouldn't mind a bit more polish here and there, especially as prices aren't exactly cheap. And this leads me to my main criticism: Tarte Flambée is an exceptionally cheap dish to produce, which is why I find a price range starting from six Euros a bit overconfident. That isn't to say the actual taste wasn't good, because it was - the base was crispy and light, though it could have done with more generous topping (and maybe more hearty bacon). But I generally don't like it when a restaurant's profit margins are as obvious as is the case at Jimmy Elsass'. The dessert menu also offers a sweet Tarte Flambée with apple and almonds ""flambé-ed"" with Calvados. It sounded intriguing, but actually wasn't all that nice, as the alcohol's taste was a bit too dominant and made the Tarte's base very soggy indeed. I'd avoid it in the future. Which isn't something I'd say of Jimmy Elsass in general - the place's got a focused menu with decent, if overpriced offerings. I just won't go out of my way to get there in the future and will definitely try the competition, as well."
4,"We had a family lunch. The place is nice and food is good and tasty. A lot of German dishes, a bit heavy on condiments but this is my personal taste as I am not originally from Germany. We had a salmon burger, two regular burgers and a fish on a potatoes bed. Nice and fast service"
2,"We went here twice in one day!  For dinner was actually because a handful of other restaurants seemed to be closed and we wanted a menu with a variety of menu options.  Earlier that Monday the whole team went here for lunch.  My german team told us that the pizzas here are huge, so one of my collagues and I shared a caprese pizza (they gave us both one half).  I enjoyed the fresh table bread they provided.  Service during the day was better than when we went at night.  The caprese pizza was alright, but had just one small little ball of mozzarella and one teeny basil leaf on each slice.  I would have expected more.  As others have mentioned, the toppings are on the sparse side.  I also ordered a side salad, so I only ended up eating one slice of pizza and taking the rest to go.When we came back for dinner later that night, they were very busy but we were able to get a table by the door.  I had ordered a tomato shrimp gnocchi dish, the girls had ordered an artichoke cream soup and a special crawfish pasta.  We all ended up sharing even though my main dish was the gnocchi.  The portions here are huge again, even more so with the pasta.  The gnocchi were very pillowy and filling.  I actually enjoyed the light cream sauce crawfish pasta more, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish.  And the artichoke cream soup was refreshing.  Again, since they were so busy, we had to keep asking for several things.  But it's honestly not a bad option for a cheap Italian meal.  Dishes top around 12-13 Euro."
4,"After getting a late start in finding a place for dinner, very few restaurants were still open. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we discovered wonderful Cappricio. Very nice house wine, excellent Caprese salad, amazing truffle linguine and a beautiful chocolate mousse dessert made for a memorable meal. But the star of the evening was the service. Friendly, attentive and helpful. Definitely will come back."
4,"superb food, superb choice, reasonable prices. nice that they serve with tea and chips while you wait to pick up a take away order."
3,"We had a good experience at this restaurant. My husband had the original LABSKAUS and really liked it, I had SCHNITZELS with lemon and ate it all, it was delicious. Service was excellent and in English! The atmosphere was friendly and family oriented, we do recommend this place."
4,this place is great! good fresh pizza made fast with whatever toppings you want. and it's totally cheap too. i found my pizza joint
4,Great place. Good ramen. lots of variety. May have to wait for about 20 mins to get in
2,"I came here with a group of 12 last weekend for my friend's going away dinner and drinks celebration. The location, weather and atmosphere were all lovely. After living in Hamburg for seven months, it was a revelation the city had such a lovely spot. It was very crowded, so there was a long wait to get my Falafel burger. Unfortunately, it was expensive (10 Euro), was accompanied by literally 5 potato wedges and it costs about 10 Euro. Similarly the cocktails were expensive and very watery. The group I was with had similar experiences. So skip the food and get a beer instead"
4,"Came here with my (admittedly meat-loving and very skeptic) boyfriend and we both really liked it! We had the ""cheese"" baked nachos to start and liked it a lot. We also both really enjoyed our main dishes - I had the mr. Bean burrito and my boyfriend the Vitaly burger with the ""beyond meat"" patty. So good! I also tried a bit of the burger patty and was shocked that it's vegan as it tastes exactly like meat. This place is good enough to impress even your meat-loving friends. Give it a try!"
3,"I cycled to Volkspark for the first time this weekend, and while a lot of the park is relatively uncared for, there is some great woodland and nice paths for walking, jogging or cycling. I should mention that it's not suitable for roadbikes - a mountain bike would be best. The woodland here was actually more fun to cycle around than that in the nearby Niendorfer Gehege forest, and there are some reasonably sized hills. Almost part of the park is the Dahliengarten which is incredibly well cared for, and I assume from walking around it has probably the biggest collection of Dahlia flower species in the world. Also just on the edge of the park is the Hauptfriedhof Altona (main Altona cemetery), which is also nice to walk around. Overall, I think it's a better park for cycling, jogging or walking the dog than actually using as a standard park - most of Volkspark is forested."
4,Just moved to the good and I have to say this is very decent Thai food.Other than the other Asian restaurants that claim to be Thai this actually has proper Thai food. Pad Thai is on point. They have a few delicious but very different dishes instead of 150 items that all taste the same. No bs and great flavor. Stay local and support your hood!
3,"Great sandwiches, and in general their bread and cheese plate was a perfect start to a Sunday. Their barista was good too. It was hustling and bustling with people. I enjoyed having food and people watching :)"
3,"Classic Schanze! I can honestly say that anyone and everyone from Hamburg has been here at LEAST once. Literally, at least ""ONCE,"" I repeat that.  Even visitors have made their way to this bar and the allure is that well, you see it first when walking around the infamous streets of Schanzenviertel.  The typical routes are three main roads of either Schanzenstrasse, Susannenstrasse, or Schulterblatt.  I think Goldfischglas is again popular because it has a club/loungy feel and serves a good full bar at reasonable prices. There are plenty of places to sit, a dance floor downstairs, and a football/kicker table for a male testosterone match or teaming up on a date couple vs. couple or girls vs. boys :)I like this bar because the music is loud enough to listen to, but quiet enough where you can actually talk to people and socialize if you really want to.  They used to have this cool table in the center that had a neon glow with these fish shadows that swam around and they added just enough water on top to get your finger wet if you dipped it in to touch the screen.  People always played with it, because we thought you could control the direction the fish shadows would swim by touching the plexiglas screen, but i am not sure if that really worked or just mere coincidence, haha...People here dress a a bit more trendy than other bars in Schanzenviertel.  I feel this is where the preppy/casual crowd hangs out.  Overall, it is actually a good mixture of all different types and that is what I like, because there is always a different crowd every time I come here.  Sometimes older, sometimes younger, some in hooded sweatshirts and some in polos with Hamburg style red pants, and sometimes just all of the above.  It is also open late, so another reason for the popularity of the late night crowd. They make nice mojitos here and the crushed ice is nice on a warm night!"
4,"Great asian food, and it's all vegan! Every lunch is only 6,90EUR and includes a soup or spring rolls as starter. (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  My vegetables with tofu and cashews were absolutely delicious! (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  Great food and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."
4,"The falafel wraps here are SO GOOD! I really like how they use real whole vegetable toppings in their wraps instead of stuffing it with cold cabbage or lettuce. Aaaand you can also watch them prepare/cook the falafel balls in front of you, so you know they're fresh. For EUR3,50 you really can't get a better deal. Five stars and two thumbs up!"
2,"I was there for lunch and it was ok. Nothing really impressed me: overage food (I had salad and my friend pizza), average service, average prices, no atmosphere whatsoever. Also service was pretty relaxed and I had only 1 hr to eat and get back to the office. At the moment there is a massive road construction outside and it's extermly noisy to sit outside. Another reason try another place to eat."
3,"Pizza is extremely delicious. Dough is paper-thin and made fresh in their open kitchen. Really great recipe. I went there for dinner twice during a 4-day stay in Hamburg. Pizzas are one size only, which is huge, so unless you haven't eaten for 3 days, don't order a whole pizza for yourself, you will be very satisfied with just a half. Toppings are amazing, however, depending on which pizza you order, you may get a very small amount of the premium ingredients. This was true with the Caprese pizza which came only with 3 small slices of mozzarella and with the spicy salsiccia pizza, which came with just a handful of the spicy pepperoni slices. They have English-language menus available, a modest wine list, a nice decor, comfortable general ambiance and it was very busy both times I was there (a Saturday night, around 22:00 and a Tuesday evening, around 19:00).However, you must be wondering why I didn't rate this place with 5 stars... The answer is very simple: They serve you the wine in small ""water glasses"". And they're not even the nice kind of water glasses... I'm talking about the cheap, ugly kinds that you buy a dozen for 0,50€ at a discount store. Germany is a country of very strict laws and they should make one where restaurants are not allowed to serve wine unless they are served in wine glasses. In fact, it should be a crime to not serve wine in a proper wine glass! Specially in an Italian restaurant! I would not be surprise if Italy, along with every wine producer and sommelier in the world does not decide to rage war against this place. It was really an abomination when the waitress placed a glass of red wine on my table using that horrid glass. I immediately asked for a proper wine glass. The waitress on Saturday night promptly gave a ""you're not the only one to ask smile"" and brought a proper wine glass. Unfortunately, the waitress from Tuesday night said there were no more proper wine glasses available even though I was seated right in front of the bar and could clearly see at least 8 clean wine glasses in the shelf... Not cool. In short: fantastic pizza, order without fear! Despicable way of serving wine... Whose idea was this? Bacchus, the Roman God Of Wine is crying at the moment..."
4,"A delightful, local restaurant for authentic German food. Both the schnitzel and the sausages were remarkable. Right on the water, the outdoor seating was delightful. Service was great. Highly recommended."
4,"The ""Hamburger Rathaus"" is really impressive ! We can see it from far away.I just loved its architecture, particulary its roof with blue tiles.Unfortunately, I didn't had the chance to visit the interior."
4,Spaghetti Eis is da best. Also the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had.
4,"On my travels I use to allow myself at least one dinner in a nice restaurant. This is definitely one restaurant that I would recommend to everybody making a stop in Hamburg. Forget stars and point! Nice place (and if you're luck to have seats in front of the canal it is really amazing!!), very welcoming staff, great dishes (maybe portions are too big) but presentation and quality have been really surprising. Price and quality give a really high rate to this cosy restaurant where decoration and staff make you feel at home!"
4,"Always my first choice when going out to eat in Hamburg, friendly atmosphere and delicious food. Try the Lamb rack it's always my first choice, but the other dishes are also delicious. And of course the Mezze as to start of the meal. The price point is also more than fair with this quality of food."
4,"For me this is the perfect burger place. The sizes of the burgers with a side are perfect for lunch. The taste is different, yet very much on point burgers with the perfect amount of asian flavors. The ambience and service is perfect. I would go here for a mid day burger anytime."
3,"Wow - all the hype is accurate! Really good/incredible cakes and coffee. Minus one star because it's so busy and loud. We came at 4pm on a Friday, prime Kaffeeklatsch time and it was really busy. The cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had, the poppy seed mousse cake with cassis was also incredible but my rhubarb meringue cake was disappointing. The cake was flavorless, the filling was really solid, and the meringue was weepy. Pour over coffee was great too. Will absolutely be back. I wish they had a cookbook I could buy!"
4,"This place is fabulous! I have been there a few times after playing sports or with a group of co-workers. Service is attentive, not fake, funny, knowledgeable. Atmosphere is Greek at heart, sometimes there are Greeks from the neighbourhood gathering and singing. Food is delicious, portions are big, but not too big. The appetisers like octopus or sardines were not drowned in oil, but just delicious. We usually order other appetisers, too and mix food and drinks....  Drinks: I always have a retsina wine, which reminds me of Greece. Happy customer"
4,"Completely amazing, spell binding and impressive. Make sure you wear comfy shoes and leave enough time to see it all! And the tip at weekends & holidays is to pre-book your arrival time on their website to avoid unnecessary queuing when you get there."
4,"My long ambition to get onto more submarines is finally coming to fruition. I've seen 2 in a month! My fascination with these relics of the cold war stems mainly from enjoying ""The Hunt for Red October"" so much. U-434 is a Soviet vessel dating from 1976. She is a Tango-class (NATO designation) attack boat, armed with 24 torpedoes. Powered by 3x 5200 shp 6 cylinder diesels, she was, I believe, the largest non-nuclear submarine in service at the time. A German businessman thought it would be a good idea to buy her for around EUR1M in 2002, and she was transported back from Russia for a further EUR1M and now lies in Hafen City. Admission is around EUR12 with an extra EUR3 for the guided tour, which ou can have in English. I highly recommend the extra tour as you get to see areas of the boat (command room etc.) that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. Sadly, as she was still in active service as a training boat until 5 years ago, the Ruskies removed quite a bit of equipment from her before she was sold. Therefore, you won't be plotting a firing solution as the torpedo computer has gone, along with sonar and communications. For the most part though this is as authentic as it gets. One ping only."
4,"We were here with my Chinese in-laws, to give them a first impression of German food. so it was not the easiest for any restaurant to please us. However ""Goldene Gans"" managed to make us happy. It was crowded, but luckily they have a very nice back section, which I did not know about. So the restaurant is a good deal larger than it appears at first sight. The service was perfect and was not uncomfortable by a mixed language group (In-laws speak neither English nor German). The waiter handled everything graciously, brought the baby-chair for our little one (as soon as it was free) without the need for a reminder. Sharing dishes so everybody gets to try everything was no problem either an de got extra knifes and forks. We had deer, pork, Zander and trout. All tasted very good."
3,"Little Vietnamese restaurant that looks like it's family owned. Service was good and decor was nice. Menu is in German so bring your Google translate. Food is good by German standard. Since german food is usually not strong on spices it seemed like the taste had been brought down from the Vietnamese food offered in Canada.We had the shrimp and chicken cold rolls as an appetizer. The chicken was dry but the rest was ok. The sauce was the highpoint of this dish.As a main course I had the chicken curry. The curry had a good taste. It was indicated as a 2nd level of spicy out of 3 but it really was a 1 in my taste. My girlfriend had the pho and it tasted what it was supposed to.Overall a good experience that cost 23.70 euros for 1 appetizer, 2 main meal and 1 soft drink."
4,"This was one of my favorite places while visiting Hamburg. Such a great welcoming vibe: old wooden tables, candles - cozy but not precious. The owner was extremely nice and they have an English menu too which was so nice after struggling to decipher German menus for weeks. I had the chicken burger which was incredible - full of flavor, topped with bacon and all the usual toppings. Highly recommend!  I enjoyed it with a Petit Chablis which I rarely see for sale in the US - definitely not a wine snob approved pairing but it hit the spot. If you're in the area definitely try this spot out!"
2,"Though the burgers are a bit expensive, they are a joy to bite into when you are craving a burger similar to something you would find in the US.  Their burger sauce is pretty good, and everything is fresh and made to order.  Another downside to it being a bit expensive, is your not full after one burger."
3,"I had lunch here today and immensely enjoyed it. The quality of the seafood is excellent and they cook it very well. My Pfannfisch (which I was told was a local Hamburg dish) with pan fried potatoes and a mustard sauce was excellent. Light fluffy and flaky fish with excellent potatoes and the sauce was also quite tasty (missing a bit of intensity for a mustard sauce). My oyster entree was also great and fresh. It was a bit expensive at €21 for 6 oysters but I had to try it as I have not had any oysters since arriving in Germany :-) I think I will keep looking for good oysters but it is not easy to find.This place is certainly not cheap and lunch for two with two courses and mineral water was around €80. I think you pay for the view here which many of the restaurants in the area do not have.I would come back here for the seafood but will explore loads of other places nearby also, that serve seafood (there is a line of seafood restaurants in this area so you have plenty of choice)."
2,"We ate at Kartoffelkeller on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The restaurant is on a very picturesque street in Hamburg, right on the water. The concept of a potato themed restaurant intrigued us so we decided to give it a shot. There weren't many other patrons in the restaurant since we were late for lunch so we were seated right away.  The decor seemed a bit dated and it seems like a place that gets a lot of business from tourists--which isn't a bad thing but you could tell the place needed a little ""freshening-up.""I had the Hamburger Pannfisch and the husband had potato pancakes and the potato soup with sausage. Both of our meals weren't particularly spectacular but they weren't horrible either. We came away satisfied so we consider that a win. Portions were large but we didn't think that the food quality justified the price."
4,"Ich war mit meiner Schwester & Mutter am Samstag hier frühstücken. Aufgrund frühzeitiger Reservierung haben wir einen richtig schönen Tisch am Fenster bekommen (im Gretchens Lädchen). Unsere Bedienungen waren wider aller Befürchtungen super freundlich und richtig süß. Da kann ich mich den Erfahrungen anderer Yelper hier glücklicherweise nicht anschließen.Jetzt zum Essen: Tolle Auswahl an Frühstücksoptionen! Meine Wahl bestand aus 2 Scheiben Vollkornbrot, 1 Körnerbrötchen, 2 Scheiben Putenbrust, 2 Scheiben Serrano Schinken, 2 kleine Scheiben Salami, Frischkäse, Butter, süßer Senf, Apfel-Zimt Marmelade, Bananenquark mit Müsli und Obst und eine gute und vielseitige Portion Gemüse. Das alles für 7,90€ Richtig super! Dazu habe ich noch für 3,90 Rührei mit Tomaten und Schnittlauch bestellt. War super gemacht, schön locker und nicht zu fettig, aber für meinen Geschmack etwas zu lasch. Salz- & Pfeffermühlen stehen aber auf den Tischen. Fazit: absolut empfehlenswert! Die Liebe zum Detail zeigt sich nicht nur an der tollen Einrichtung im Vintage-Stil, sondern auch an der Zusammenstellung der Mahlzeiten.Kommen gerne wieder!"
1,"Would love to give them a higher rating but the carrot quiche that we had was TERRIBLE. I have no doubt that because we were the Americans we were subjected to what we were told was ""the last of the quiche"" and ""the only quiche available"" was the carrot quiche. The gentleman ahead of us had ham and the 4 people that came in after us also were given the option of ham, of course they took ham. Awful, awful, awful"
4,"We went here on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. We were greeted and looked after by very friendly and knowledgeable staff from our arrival to our departure. A lovely bowl of spicy krupuk crackers was a tasty appetiser followed by a whole steamed perch (Rotbarsch) with a light orange and ginger sauce, cooked to perfection and served with boiled rice. All very reasonably priced in a stylish, modern restaurant."
4,"The Bird could use a little more atmosphere, but it's early days and the food and the staff are just so awesome, it deserves the full five stars. Sadly though I think the sheer class of the Bird is a bit wasted on the Hamburgers, with their naff Croques and Jim Blocks. This is greasy, hearty Americana at it's best. Spread the word."
3,"If it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd probably go to Pony Bar pretty often. It's a reasonably priced, cool little bar. Unfortunately it's miles away, and there's about 50 good bars in between it and me :)"
4,The best fucking Turkish food in Hamburg. I've been trying different places all week and non of them can compare to here. They use real tandoori ovens and charcoal grill it's truly fucking amazing. Plus the owner is so nice and speaks English. If you're in Hamburg this place is a must I could eat here daily.
1,"The beer is good. The service was poor / spotty. I think they prefer their local crowd who will be there. Not child friendly at night, though they have a kids menu."
1,Very boring food - tasteless pasta and salat that did not seem fresh. But the staff was very energetic and the location on a side street was very nice.
4,"This place was amazing!  The place was easy to find and very cute inside.  They had an English menu; our waitress was amazing and spoke fluent English, and made great suggestions with the menu.  I had the Spätzle with cheese and bacon and my boyfriend had the special, a lemon and rosemary Spätzle - both were large portions and very delicious.  This was our first dinner in Hamburg and I would recommend it for anyone! I would recommend if you have a larger group to make a reservation ahead of time, as a good portion of the tables were reserved when we arrived.  They also have Wifi for anyone traveling."
1,"Interesting little restaurant. It was packed, and it seemed that food was being served almost cafeteria style on silver trays, so I figured it practical to order take away. One would think I would receive the same amount of food by paying the same price (and not taking up table space in the tiny restaurant for that matter), but I ended up receiving significantly less food. It didn't even come with all items included on the menu (no salad, sauce, or yogurt). I received literally one and a half small chicken drumsticks for the main portion. The taste was decent; I just felt a little swindled out of my money. I wouldn't bother with take out again."
3,"Bulgogi burger with extra cheddar, twisted fries and pineapple mint shake. Delicious, kind service although the home made fries my kids had were a bit flaccid. Lychee limo was to die for according to my 16 year old! Would definitely come back and try the other special burgers!"
3,Sausalitos in Hamburg is situated in Chilehaus which is a very nice old office building. I have heard of Sausalitos from friends in other German cities. We tried some of the cocktails and finger-food. It was pretty good. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the waitresses were nice. Sausalitos is definitely worth a try.
3,"Good service, good goulash and great location. Would recommend! We definitely will be coming back."
4,"Great caïpirinha !!! If you need to refresh yourself, you found the good place. Katze is a nice bar located in Sternchanze and they have friendly waiters that even gave us water for free. They have a Happy Hour while you can have a caïpirinha for only 4,50€. Don't hesitate, they worth it!"
4,"Another cozy bar on schanze, where you can hang out any day of the week and drink some nice cocktails or whatever you prefer."
3,"I was near the Alster Lake on a nice Sunday afternoon and wasn't sure where to go for lunch. I found Jim Block to be right near the lake, and there was a huge crowd. I went in, and ordered my burger  meal combo which comes with a drink and fries. I must say, the burger here was simply amazing. I also took their original Mayo, which was so thick and creamy. The fries, the mayo and the burger was the perfect combo for a nice Sunday afternoon meal. They have seating both indoors and outdoors. I'd suggest sitting outdoors. The ambience is nice for a good meal.The staff are also courteous."
4,"Beside its small room, the coffee here is good, the staff is nice and there is wifi. I can comfortably seat on a sofa with my computer, take the WiFi (probably not from there but it works nicely), and spend hours. Their cappuccinos are big!"
4,"The service is pretty slow (they are very understaffed), but the food is great. The scallop satay was really delicious. The chilli club salad was alright. The dressing was pretty fatty and the duck was fried. The chicken satay was pretty good, but also seemed a little unhealthy. The california rolls were very good. The red chicken curry wasn't so great. The sweet coconut curry with chicken was excellent and the chicken in it tasted fantastic with just salt and pepper.Even though the service was a little slow, our waitress was extremely friendly. I'd definitely recommend going here."
3,Went here for a business dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I had read many of the good reviews on here and wasn't expecting much. Thankfully I walked out happy. It's a really nice room and a good place for business or private meals. Service was polite and very professional. The menu is higher-end than most places on or near the Lange Reihe. We were quite happy with both our appetisers and main courses and had a great bottle of wine to go with it.....a recombination from the waiter. I'll definitely be back here when entertaining out of town business guests. I also would come with my wife for a romantic dinner. A really solid place which has established itself over the years and is well frequented. I highly recommend reserving a table if you do come.
4,"The staff don't speak English, and this place gets hopping with good business. Yet, the servers are kind, gracious and patient.Outstanding lentil soup with bread and great value for money at 4.5euro. A solid lunch. But the mixed grill was delectable and showcased what this place is about--grilled lamb, kebab, kofta and chicken with rice and couscous.Open until 06:00h, cash only."
3,"Stylish place just past the Mercado, about 3 mins walk from Altona station. It's fairly dark and swanky, but the prices aren't too inflated with an Augustina Brau at a fairly standard EUR3.50 a bottle. Good, and indeed, good looking, service, and cool beats. There's a smoking room out the back but down let your friends trick you into sitting in there as it's bloody freezing!"
4,"Very nice smell as we walked in! A smell of fresh backed croissant. Pls reserve the table coz the cafe is not really big. Suitable for kids: baby chair, diaper change table and a box with books and drawing pens are available"
3,"Great spot to hang out, just off The Reeperbahn and away from the craziness. They play great music, the bartenders are fantastic and the crowd are a good bunch. Since it is just off The Reeperbahn, it is GREAT people watching.....just park yourself by one of the windows, grab a drink and peer out at the mix of locals, tourists, hookers and the rest of the lot. You can easily waste away hours drinking and dancing (if there's room). I HIGHLY recommend when you inevitably find your way to this delightfully seedy part of town."
3,"Excellent paella! The staff speaks Spanish, Portuguese, and German. It is reasonably priced, we were a party of three and ordered more food than we could possibly eat and only spent 60 euros including drinks."
3,"Popped in here the other day when my staple in the area was unexpectedly closed. The Roosen is a cute lil' place - the sofas are well comfortable, service is very friendly (albeit a tad hover-ey), drinks are well prepared and the price is right (4.50 for a caipirinha sounds like my cup of caipirinha!). Would love to come back here - a really nice place to kick back early and drink yourself through the evening on a weeknight with some good company. One star off for the kind of toilets you don't want to visit when you're a tad tipsy - the trip down will send you into a spin!"
3,"This is a lovely little local spot. Cash only. We went for breakfast and the server spoke enough English to explain the whole menu to us, and was really quite lovely. The bread is nice but not warm. The flavors are subtle - nothing really screams out at you but everything is nice. I got a plate with meat, cheese and bread and my husband got a tomato and salami scramble with bread as well. They go heavy on the butter here, which I like (it's served pate style so you can use as much or as little as you like). The food is fairly light. I wasn't hungry anymore once I ate here but wasn't super full either and ended up getting a buffet for lunch later. The latte here is an absolute highlight not to be missed. The foam is just perfection. No free refills on the coffee. All in all I'm glad we went but I wasn't impressed enough to go back a second time."
3,"When I'm hungry and I'm in the Reeperbahn area this is my favourite spot to get some fast food. Their Pide is really tasty, I'd definitely recommend it and they make it right in front of you. I've never been bothered to try anything else apart from it though , but they've got even Kebap here."
4,"Very very good burrito. Dead friendly staff, quick service, delicious burritos and good beer. Only slight criticism is the lack of cheese topping, but can't fault them on the filling. Good price too. I'm definitely becoming a regular. Going to have to try the steak burrito pretty damn soon."
4,"Some of the best, nicest barkeepers I've ever seen.Great selection of American whiskeys, will convert the most ardent scotch lover."
4,Great place to enjoy a hearty breakfast and a nice cappuccino. The place looks nice and the staff is friendly.
4,"A Kebab joint unlike any other I've encountered setting a whole new bench mark as far as kebab shops go Firstly a proper dine in Kebab shop?! Unreal! Being use to ordering my Kebab from a corner stall after a big night out, consuming the contents either on a street bench or as I walk home, this place resembles more of a comfortable Turkish bar/cafe then any kebab shop back in Sydney.The place obviously has quite a following with it's tables still full and lively even on a late Tuesday night. The servings are huge and very tasty!!! Ordering a small plate delivered enough food to comprise three meals for me let alone one! The highlight for me was being able to order a nice cold one with my meal-The fact that I can now enjoy both a Beer and a Kebab simultaneously and at the beginning of a night out rather then as the end of a big one has definitely secured a loyal customer out of me A Kebab shop that serves Beer is just plain genius!! If only they did this in Australia."
4,"Everytime when we have non-Hamburg guests, we would invite them for some German dishes at Schweinske! It was my first time today at the Reeperbahn branch & it was better than I expected. Spacious, clean & the waiters are friendly. In general, love their schnitzels!"
2,"Cute little Café with lovely, little bit weirdo owners in walkable distance to the Hamburger Dom fair. They follow the ""build your own"" principle, which is nice since you get only what you like but also paying for every single item individually adds up.Generally prices are reasonable, the food is good but nothing too extraordinary, portion sizes are generous. They cakes are home made and did look delicious and juicy. Drinks come in bowls if desired, which is beautiful.Unfortunately most of the place is kinda dark because its located in the lower level."
2,"Came here over the weekend as we wanted to check out the Dom but we arrived too early so we walked about 10 min over to Jim Burrito to get some lunch. The place is a bit small and it was packed. There was no line to order so we figured we can just order to go. Luckily as we were ordering a table opened up.I don't think this place takes reservations so you should arrive early to get a good table.We just ordered the burritos, one chorizo and one beef. We were tempted to order the chips and guac but as I saw other tables ordering, I didn't like the chips to guac ratio. Looks like a lot of nacho cheese tortilla chips and a small bit of guac. Also the burritos looked huge and I knew we would fill up on chips and guac and wouldn't be able to finish our burritos later.The wait was a bit long for our burritos. Looks like there is only one chef handling all the orders. There is a sign on a chalkboard letting customers know that the wait can be long so at least they acknowledged this. The burritos arrived after about 15 to 20 min. They are not served in tinfoil and looks like they are grilled on a panini press and then finished in the oven. I am from San Francisco so I expect all my burritos to be in tinfoil unless its a wet burrito so I was weary when I saw the grill marks, the wax paper and the knife and fork. I cut into the chorizo burrito and it looked reasonable - lots of black beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, onions and chorizo. The flavors were good but different then my normal burrito experiences back in the Bay. We dosed the burritos in tapatio and habanero green sauce and that helped kick up the heat and flavors. The chorizo bits were a bit awkward they were a bit chewy and didn't mesh well with the other flavors going on in the burrito.All in all its an OK burrito spot. But as my friend has said, its not exactly the same but it'll scratch that burrito itch when you need it."
4,Wir waren erneut zum Frühstück unter der Woche dort. Sehr hochwertige Speisen auf wirklich schön angerichteten Tellern  und ausreichend war es auch. Wir kommen wieder.
2,"This is a traditional place in Hamburg which has been around forever. I've been here multiple times over the years but having just watched the EM final there last night, it was time to write something. It's basically a kiosk turned into a restaurant. It's still has the shabby flair but they've gone upmarket a bit adding things like wine, shrimp, salads to the menu. I don't know how little they used to serve way back when but it's no longer just beer and fries. Surprisingly enough, I had the beer and fried and they were really good. I haven't ever eaten anything else here and it's not gourmet or anywhere near it. If you are up for a classic beach club in Hamburg, live nearby and can get here easily (which is not the case when coming from the other side of town) and the sun is out or it's a warm evening, definitely stop in. Plus, as someone already wrote in the German section the crowd is also becoming a bit more upscale again. This place went a bit down-scale over the years but I believe management is doing it's best to get out of that hole and attract hipper people. If that's a good thing, I don't know!"
4,"Great location, tasty and cheap burgers, long queues, not enough seats. But there is always an option to get food takeaway and sit next to Alster!"
3,"I tried some of the non-sushi dishes on the menu. There are not that many dishes, but the ones I tried were very tasty and were served pretty quickly as well. The staff was very nice. The decoration is modern and nice. You can definately have a yummy meal at the echtasien even if you are not a Sushi fan."
3,"Great food with fantastic seating inside! Very crowded on the weekends so expect a wait. The food is served in trays and very affordable. About 6 euros per dish served with bread, rice, yogurt, Dahl, small salad, rice and the main dish. Lacks true authentic spice but very good still. Recommend tikka and the saag, and if you're a fan of spicy just ask!"
4,The Mexicana kumpir is incredible. Located in an awesome part of Hamburg with hip shops and bars.
4,"The chocolate tour was very interesting. Learned a lot about chocolate, where it comes from and how it's made.  Enjoy tastes from every step of the process and make your own chocolate bar. Super fun time ad great quality chocolate!"
0,"They put the chairs upside down in our table while there were 15 min to closing. A good product will not sell if you don't know how to behave , sorry Jim Borrito"
4,"A very enjoyable casual meal. We were in the area and found Scharf for lunch. While it wasn't an important criterion, the price of the meal was very reasonable. The food was well prepared and presented. If you're in the area, it's a very good choice. It may not be worth the time to travel there from a significant distance."
4,"After tons of walking, we were in need of a break and decided to stop in for a late afternoon beer. The ambiance is quite lovely - hipster, but in the way where you enjoy it. Interesting architectural features, clean, and tiny little boat models in the windows. They have 4 beers on tap (I think 3 were pils and one was a wheat, all nice choices). Prices were reasonable and the bartenders were super friendly and were able to communicate with us in English (well one could, anyway). They don't take cards. They do have comfy sofas though to make up for it. Great music too. Make sure to come in and stay a while."
4,"Dafür 5 Sterne! In diesem Wohnzimmer gibts nur Basics zu trinken. Aber mit diesen Basics wirst Du zu 100% glücklich. Hier gibts die tollsten Sofas, die nettesten Bedienungen, die abgefahrensten Einrichtungsgegenstände und die hübschesten Mädchen. Was willst Du mehr? Ne? Also, dafür 5 Sterne!"
4,"This was my go-to coffee spot in Hamburg. Missing it to this day.Great location, really nice staff and the coffee is just amazing. I still dream of the perfect double-shot Americanos I got from here.This plus a few other places alone would make Hamburg worth a trip."
2,"5EUR entry costcheesy music... the kind of music you'd only expect to hear in german clubsi mean 80s and 90s music mixed with last year's songs and a bit of bob marley then some ABBA.The DJ thinks that by mixing, he's supposed to mix styles and songs...ok you get my point: Music - BADbut at least its full, its funnythere are a lot of people, which means a lot of weird people too. I am not sure id be back... not really my type of club but if u were rejected entry in the other hip clubs, try it out... you'll have a laugh"
3,"Authentic California-Mexican. Do not come here expecting mexican taqueria style tacos and burritos. Come here for something close to Chipotle or El Torito. However, considering the international food scene in Hamburg, the food here is quite good. I recommend the Beef Ranchera and Carnitas. Their Beef Ranchera is obviously stewed and not grilled (like real asada ranchera), but it's still quite tasty. Carnitas flavorful and not too dry. Wish they had corn tortillas for tacos."
0,"I have never before in my life returned sushi to the chef, until my unfortunate encounter at Sushi Circle. I payed for an all-you-can-eat as a recommendation from a friend, and ended up having half a piece of nigiri, and asking for my money back. Up until this point, I must have eaten at about a hundred some-odd Sushi eateries - only a trickle served worse Sushi and provided a worse experience than at Sushi Circle. I have not grown up in a culture which serves sushi as a cultural thing (Read: I am not Japanese) but would like to be able to say that I have had enough experience with Sushi to be able to note when it's well made, or the product of ""Raw fish slackery"". I fear ""Sushi Circle"" falls into the latter category. To avoid rambling on in generic terms, here's what I didn't like about Sushi Circle's sushi experience: - The Rice/Vinegar ratio. The rice was tasteless, non-sticky, and the nigiri was falling apart. - The fish.With fresh fish, my teeth sink into the sushi. With this stuff, I needed to put up a fight. - The service.If I ask for nigiri without wassabi wedged between the rice and the fish, do I have to wait half an hour? - The selection. ""All you can eat"" rounds are not always known for their marvelous selection, but having 4 types of sushi on the conveyor belt is rather poor. - The seating.Sushi circle's establishment is built in such a way where you need to squirm and crawl to get out of your seat, or to allow others to pass by you. Very disappointed and will not return under any circumstances."
4,"My new favorite Falafel place!!! I love it when i get so many freebiesi ordered the (number 23) Chicken Shawarma, and while i was waiting for my order, i got a Date-cookie, then a sesame cookie.. and then i got a free falafel! The owner is from Iraq and quite friendlyit did help that we have the same mother language, but stillHe had also offered the previous 2 customers the sesame cookie although they couldnt speak a word of arabic (excluding falafel and hummus). The chicken shawarma tasted really good... i eat everything if its immersed in hummus... A sandwich costs between 3EUR50 and 4EUR pretty fair for the size of the sandwich ur getting..."
4,"And so I did check it out! Pauli Pizza is definitely my new fave take-out pizza place! The menu is only DIY, and I was very overwhelmed by the choice. Fortunately the creative pizza genius of Lea was on hand to produce a pizza to savour. Two eggs? Yes please! Highly recommended for pizza, beer and chat."
4,"Qype City night January '08 brought me here. They had prepared a great set menu for us. Nine dishes, they said, but I'm pretty certain it was more like 12. We had cold dishes to start, glass noodles, cold meats, tofu & garlic, etc. That wasn't really my thing, but each successive course brought better and better food. One course brought some really great prawns. They were messy to eat, but delicious. After the two (or three, I forget) main courses came some amazing soup, and after that we got one small sweet dish. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it seemed like dates covered in dough, rolled in sesame seeds. The best chinese food I've had in Hamburg (Ok, I've not really had much chinese food, but still :)"
1,"A bit pricey but nice burgers, although you have to wait at least 30 minutes to get your order. My last visit I ordered fries with a burger, and I waited 30 minutes for a burger after that had to wait ten more minutes to get fries.Good food, slow service. Overall you can find better places in Hamburg, for less price."
3,Quaint little restaurant. Gets busy..make resvs'. All looks delicious. The home made cider is super yumm. They also have a clothing store in there.. They all look like fishermen.. Haha and like any good french place - it seriously smells like butter! Enjoy!
4,"We accidentally landed here during peak lunchtime hour, and you could tell from quite a distance that this place is a fav among the locals. Despite a lengthy queue, we got our Döner Dürüm in less than 15 minutes. In short, if you love kebab, this is the place for you!"
3,Brüdigams combines  an interesting and relaxing atmosphere with quality food. Our waiter was really helpful and we ended up enjoying delicious wild boar with a delightful Bulgarian red wine. All and all the experience was great and good value for money. Would visit again.
4,"I went there on a saturday morning for a breakfast/brunch and choose the breakfast buffet order. The place is super cozy, decoration is fancy and comfy and it never felt too crowded. The buffet had great food and a lot of options for either regular, lowcarb, paleo and veggie. You can drink as much coffee as you want with the buffet and they also include fresh made scrambled eggs that tasted divine. It's a suitable place for couples and families, totally worth your money."
4,"For authentic and traditional northern German cuisine and ambiance, Brodersen takes the cake. This place attracts more of an older crowd, but that shouldn't stop you young folk. This is definitely a restaurant that you appreciate for upholding tradition and its' sophistication. The interior design has a nautical scheme, and it creates a very intimate and romantic setting because of the dim lighting. If you want to avoid the romance and are looking for a more casual and relaxed setting, sit outside!I ordered the Schölle - Büsumer Art, which is with the Nordsee Krabben. Being a potato-maniac, the highlight of my meal was the Bratkartoffeln (roast potatoes). However, everything else was absolutely perfectly delicious. I have no complaints. Only conflict I faced at Brodersen was that I didn't know how to properly use the seafood utensils and how to de-bone my Schölle. But now, I do!Brodersen would be at the top of my list if I was visiting Hamburg. I would highly recommend taking visiting travelers and families here for dinner. It's food, atmosphere and design create a warm and lovely atmosphere. You'd want to share this experience with others!Side note: I found this place extremely comparable to a restaurant in Montecito, CA - Stella Mare. So if you're ever in town, check it out ~"
4,"We stumbled upon this place after doing a free walking tour, and I'm so glad we did! Everyone was so nice, and were really willing to help us out by explaining things in English. and the food was so delicious! I had a sandwich and my wife had the risotto with a salad. We both absolutely loved it. Great place for a great lunch!"
0,"We were invited to a large dinner party at La Sepia and had high hopes. The folks around the table kept buzzing about how the restaurant is known for it's good fish, and any fish I was bound to order would probably be the best fish I had had in a while. Unfortunately, the fish at La Sepia blows. No, I didn't get a bad dish - the folks next to me, who also ordered the ""Fischplatte"" (an assortment of different types of fish), received the exact same meal. All sat there swooning over their meals as I stared bored over my food, fork in hand, and exclaimed: ""THIS is what you think good fish tastes like?!?"". Don't get me wrong - for many people, the fish at La Sepia will be the best fish they have ever tasted. These people have probably been mainly having fish from the Elbe river. The sauce is pretty good. For the rest of us who are used to Mediterranean fish, the fish at La Sepia will be dull, tasteless and boring. Conclusion: He who travels to the coast of the Mediterranean sea shall have real fish. He who stays in Hamburg should stick to sardines."
1,"This is a low-quality Indian shop in the food court of the Europa Passage. None of the entrees that I've tried taste more than just okay. It's priced accordingly to actual Indian places in Hamburg, and as the food isn't very tasty, you should avoid going here unless you're specifically in the Europa passage and don't want to walk anywhere else to get food. It's fine for Europa Passage terms. I usually eat here or the falafel place when I'm lazy and in the mall."
0,"Nice cafe with unfortunately really unfriendly and rude service. I can understand stress from the workers when the line is long and there are a lot of people, but no need to slam plates on the counter and roll your eyes at customers."
4,"Absinth bar is back! Hurrah! It was always one of the best and most unique bars in Hamburg and now after a year away it has returned bigger and better than ever! If you're familiar with it's old location this is literally more of the same. ""More"" in that it's much bigger, but it still retains the charm it used to have. With the increased space it seems that they're already attracting more customers, so the place is full most nights. One minor problem in these cold winter nights is that they seriously need to fix the door to make it close itself automatically. Trust me, after 10 minutes of sitting in there on a cold night you'll understand! My review of the old Absinth bar: We were on the way home from Omas. We were going to show our friend around the best bars in the schanze, but then we noticed the Absinth bar. We actually walked past, but then while discussing it briefly, we thought ""hey, why not"" and went back. The place is tiny, but really well decorated with a beautiful bar full of every kind of Absinth there is. The walls have plaster strategically removed in patches to give it a pseudo-shambolic feel. Not knowing one Absinth from the next we asked for some ordering advice. We were asked do you like it bitter? Do you like it sweet? Bottles were brought to the table and opened for us to sniff. I do wonder whether the service is always so great, because we were the only four people in there! Anyway, for us the service was great. Our chosen drinks were brought on silver plates, with silver spoons holding an absinth dowsed sugar cube. The owner then set alight each cube for us, and explained how to drink our drinks - for our second round there were different instructions for different absinths. All in all a very unique experience, and surprisingly relaxing and tasty."
4,"I've now breakfasted twice at Moraba, and have both times stayed after I finished to study. The best part of this place is their fresh juices  incredible. The breakfasts are also simple, but tasty. As for the local, it is very cozy, has functional Internet, and the service is always very friendly and attentive. Prices are also good for student life. I'm always very pleased when I come, and will continue to go there."
3,"Ah Rosi's Bar.. it's another of the almost identical bars on that side of Hamburger Berg. That mean's it's actually a pretty good bar, but you could just as easily pick any of 5-10 bars within 50 yards and have the same evening. - popular music? check.- dance floor? check.- cheap(ish) drinks? check.- good crowd? check.- free entry? check.- table football? check. Did I just copy/paste that review? Did someone copy/paste this bar?"
4,"This is a fine place to start your party for the night. It is on the far end of the Hamburger Berg street and I could claim it is one of the fanciest :) When you walk in all you see is a huge bar in the middle, but then when you look to the left there is a lot of place to dance too, and on the right, so to say behind the door, are a number of small tables. When you pass them and go in the direction of the bar and follow the bar you end up in the back of the bar where you have more small tables, which are away from the crowds. It gets packed during the evening (as other places). They have few hard guys that don't let drunks walk in and they got a DJ :) Most of the bartenders are women and they are allowed to take a drink with you.cheers"
4,"Very busy and popular place with excellent food and service! The staff was friendly and smiling, and the food was flavorful and attractive (my fish was cooked perfectly). The tables are very close and crammed, which is a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, the environment is enjoyable."
4,"This is actually the first place I've been in Hamburg when I first came here, so it's kind of special for me cause it brings up a lot of good memories, sensations and people. It's a great place to go if the weather is good and chill a bit drinking a beer or watching a football game, i.e. during the World Cup or the Europeans."
1,"I'm giving Wasserschloss two stars because I love the building and location, but the food was not good and the service was really bad. My partner had the vegetarian pasta, which she hated and left unfinished -- there was no sauce on the pasta, so the dish wasn't integrated.  I had the nothing special currywurst, but I'd asked for ketchup and mayo and by the time I finally got it (after asking a couple of times) the pommes frites were cold. And the bill came late after several requests.  Come here for a beer and enjoy what it offers:  ambience."
3,"Really good dim sum. Some of the best I've had in Hamburg. In truth I regret not getting more of the main dishes here. I had a few with aubergines that were actually really good and would have liked to order more.But what can I say about the dim sum here? Chicken feet, rice rolls and dumplings oh my! Well worth a 20-min U-bahn to get here and enjoy this places specialties."
3,"The museum itself is a nice museum with a lot of interesting things, but after seeing the miniature wonderland and the maritime museum, I had more than enough miniature buildings and boats. Only was able to stay 15 minutes before I couldn't take anymore of it."
3,"Don't get rid of the October Spacial Salad!!! It is amazing, made me come for the first time when I was in Zurich and back several times in Hamburg for it!!!"
0,"I ate at this place approximately one year ago. It's an experience I'll never forget because at the end of our meal we noticed several mice crawling around the restaurant. To add insult to injury, the waiter seemed annoyed that we complained about it. It's a shame because the food was very good, but I'm not interested in eating anywhere that is infested with vermin, especially not after someone tells me it's to be ""expected because you're by the water"". I'm shocked this place stayed open. Here's hoping they've since cleaned up their infestation."
4,"While visiting my friend's father for the weekend, we walked around the block to this restaurant for lunch. It was great, fresh ingredients, well prepared food, and friendly service. So good we went back for dinner the next night, equally fantastic. It's clearly popular with the locals (who ought to know!) as the place was completely full on a Tuesday night. Highly recommended. Price was reasonable too!"
1,"I really tried to like it because of good comments I heard from friends. However, I can't say that my experience was great. I ordered the Avocado Burger, and so did two other colleagues. When the burgers arrived, they all looked very different (I know we ordered different buns) but overall, the patties and the presentation was way too off. Mine looked flat and uninspiring. The flavor was not that bad, but maybe not worth the high price."
4,Came in here not particularly hungry but after seeing the size of the portions ended up eating quite a bit! Meat was so tender and tasty and I especially liked the freshness of the salad and the bread was just lovely.
2,"Main dishes are tasty and authentic in Ni Hao restaurant! The same applies for the start but due to the small size, there are heavily overprice. Hence, better go with some friends and order a few main courses. The day we visited the restaurant, the service was not particularly attentive even though it was not much business going on. When we ordered Oolong Tea, we got served something else and after complaining they top-up another Oolong tea bag For such a good Chinese restaurant, I would expect the same for the tea: having big pots with tea leaves, reasonably priced and refills of hot water free of charge."
3,"I'd say the food in here isn't as good as in Frank und Frei across the street, but it's got plenty of charm to make up for it. And you just gotta love their breakfast, which comes with a glass of sparkling wine. There was a nice buzz about the place and the staff make you feel welcome. Minus for bad coffee though."
3,"This is a very cozy and nice place to hang out and grab some food with friends. They have great vegetarian/vegan choices and are a good pick for people who like the middle-eastern cuisine. Unfortunately they were out of a few things that I wanted to try when we were there but my overall experience was still good. The prices are very good, too!"
4,"Very cozy place, somehow dark and homey in the evenings, with very nice and friendly staff!"
3,"Went there for lunch with some colleagues and we had the daily special. It's 2 course meal and a drink.The 2 courses were crepes , one was savory and one was sweet. It was delicious and costed just 8.40 Euro.Only bad thing: I'm still a little bit hungry."
4,"Great tapas. A good blend of Spanish & Moroccan styles and a good opportunity to try many dishes. I had a small lamb tagine as one dish and it was superb - maybe the best tagine I've ever had: so many great flavours. Very friendly staff in a stylish, modern restaurant."
3,"Despite being really close to the office, I hadn't yet been to Brook - maybe because it is a little bit more expensive than our usual quick lunch places! However, I thoroughly recommend it as lunchtime business venue or evening romantic spot. Situated on the busy Bei den Muhren, overlooking the water, we were able to watch the usual Hamburg weather (bright sunshine then aggressive winds and then torrential rain) rush past in the space of a relaxing 1.5 hours The restaurant itself is large and spacious with an open and modern design. Window tables such as we had I think will be much more pleasant than the inner tables. The 3 course daily lunch menu was excellent and very decent value for this quality of food: A lovely and delicate / frothy asparagus soup, tuna steak on a tomato risotto and a delicate fruit tart with ice-cream. Only minor quibble would be the speed of service - fine for a leisurely evening meal, but perhaps a little slow for a lunchtime off the set menu. But overall a really good discovery. I will be back."
4,"I wasn't entirely impressed by Mr. Kebab the first time I went, but for some reason, my second visit was the one which had me sold. The three of us ordered an ""enlarged grill Teller"" (see photos) which ended up including an insane amount of meat on a plate (it was about 30eu). How we managed to finish all of it is still somewhat of a mystery (how we managed to fit beer in afterwards is even more of a mystery), but we came out of Mr. Kebab in a blissful, beefy haze. The meat at Mr, Kebab, as I mentioned, is excellent. Well prepared and a rich menu assortment (a menu which includes many ridiculous and nonsensical bits of Engrish). The service is very friendly and the prices are extremely fair. The bathrooms are a little trippy. If this would be my only advice to you, make sure you visit the toilets before you down 3 liters of beer, and not after. You'll thank me later."
0,Awful service. Rate 1star just because there is no option of 0star rating. Big disappointment
3,"Simple place to grab an authentic and really good Italian coffee, pasta, or toasts. Friendly, popular ... and I'd go from 3.5 * to 4.0 * if they managed to clean out the cardboard, boxes, Amazon shipments and stuff on the floor next time I visit. ;)"
4,Another best place in Hamburg when the sun is shining. Next to the other bar ahoi it is just lovely to sit on the beach watching people go by
4,"If you're looking for good Italian food in Hamburg and you happen to be in the Speicherstadt area don't look too far. I really really like how they cook pasta, so far I've eaten here quite a few times and never been disappointed. My tips: spaghetti alla carbonara and gnocchi sardi. I should try their pizza or even salads but this is one of those restaurants where I'm just not able to try too many things because the few I've already tried are amazing. It may seem a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is high so if you keep that in mind I think prices are reasonable. Highly recommended!"
2,"Came for a Sunday night dinner with a coworker. It's a nice, casual, pretty traditional German restaurant. I had the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and fries, which was pretty delicious. The kupfer (copper) beer was also delicious. Service was excellent, and all of the waiters spoke English, which is nice for a gringo like me. The main menu is in German and English; being downtown and in a business district, it seems like they get a lot of tourists/travelers. Entrees are in the 10-15 Euro range.I was bummed because I really wanted the Schweinehaxe (pork shank) with dumplings, but they were out. I ordered a different pork cutlet, but they were out of that, too. This was at 7 PM on a Sunday night, so not super-late, but I suspect they don't get deliveries over the weekend, so they were pretty much out."
3,Very nice and ... Thai atmosphere. Good service and very good food. Expensive but quality kitchen.
3,"Great park! Beautiful! A private public space. Lots of green, garden, and water! Mini golf. Ping pong too! Wonderful for a stroll or a picnic! Makes you realize what we lose when we privatize parks in the US..."
4,"Great park for jogging, dog walking, picnic and just laying in the sun. You can get there really easy for it near elbchausse.I think there was even a bus station right next to the park entry."
3,"This was a pleasant surprise. Even after having read the other reviews, I was not prepared for the sheet size an ingenuity of the whole thing.  Floor after floor of painstakingly detailed models, with some really funny details here an there. Especially the airport is worthwhile to spend some time admiring the lifelike planes and vehicles, including the specific sounds that each plane makes. Quite incredible!"
4,"Seemingly run by a husband-wife combo, this is a really nice little Italian place for lunch. It's a bit imbissy with its high, small tables, but the food is great and a reasonable price. I had a Diavolo pizza and it was the best pizza that I've had in a long time. I'll be back"
3,"Very good! Can't believe it took me 5 years to try the place. Now I know why it was always so busy.My only negative is that the portions aren't consistent, I've noticed some customers getting preferential treatment with much more toppings, and this made me sad. Why do you hate me, Kumpir König!?"
2,"Actually, it was the ratings that lured us here. But it wasn't quite as ""great"" as some of the articles read. At first - yes, the service leaves nothing to be desired. Unobtrusive, but quick, nice and friendly. Questions were answered immediately. Ambience - unfortunately everything was already reserved inside, but there was space in the heated winter garden and in retrospect probably even the better choice.The menu is clearly arranged, in addition there is a laminated, small menu with the ""recommendation"". These dishes of the recommendation are on average a little more expensive.Taste: there is nothing to complain about here. Strong but well balanced. But in total rather mainstream. You miss the kick of the real Italian a bit.Do you get full? Not necessarily - at least for me three small cannelloni are not a real meal. You can't avoid ordering another little something in addition.Drinks: We had a big bottle of water with the wine. For five euros we got a rather chubby-looking blue bottle, sparkling water without any special features, and matching quite chic glasses.The wine consultation was quite ok, considering the not too abundant offer this is not surprising. The chosen Chianti was in any case reasonably priced and despite its longstanding bad reputation it was really very good. Fruity, intense, pleasant tannins. Served in wonderfully large, stylish wine glasses. Price - per dish considered reasonable, but if you want to get full you have to order something extra. Seen in this light, the attractive price is quickly doubled.A thing I really missed - there is NO PORK on the menue!"
4,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's actually really big and cute on the inside and also has a nice patio right on the canal. If you like crepes, you really can't go wrong ordering any crepe here. We tried 2 savory crepes, both the basic one with ham, cheese, and an egg and one which also includes tomato sauce and creamy mushrooms. Seriously so good. Also the people working there are all French, so you know that it must be pretty legit"
4,"Oh my god ! First you walk in and you see this cute guy with amazing eyes and a big warm smile behnd the counter. He makes you the best coffee ever and gives you a slice of cheesecake. You are in heaven.Then comes the dilema. what do you do ?Try and pick up the cute guy ?Take home the cheesecake ? Well, I'm sorry to say cute guy, but I think it's going to have to be the cheesecake. I'm sure you taste good too, but the cheesecake definately tastes better."
0,"I won't recommend this place to anyone, who likes to eat authentic Indian food the way it is. We have ordered mango lassi, sweet lassi, chicken tikka musallam and chicken reshmi kebab. All of them were equally bad."
3,"Mmmm, burritos! Big, filling, yummy, vegan and vegetarian burritos (they have beef/poultry too but I've never had one of those).It might not be the best burritos in the world, but they get the job done. :)The wait is always long, but the beers are always cold so who cares? We return every time we're in Hamburg, sometimes twice in a day..."
1,"Pretentious hipsters that make expensive, average food. :("
4,"We went during a weekday during lunch time & avail the lunch menu. It was not full, thus, we enjoyed a good service from them. They have a variety of dimsums to choose from. Choices for the main course is also very good. The menu have english translation/description in it and the waitress can speak mandarin. The prices are affordable. Each of the menu comes with a complimentary appetizer: soup -or- springroll. We enjoyed all the dishes (see submitted photos) and giving them all two thumbs up! The restaurant size is kinda small, but they do have two big round tables available for people coming in groups. Will definitely come back & will definitely recommend to others."
3,"Full on a tuesday evening!We just had a quick beer there.The bar is really laidback, cool. there are tables outside and inside.Its around 5 mins away by foot from the busy schulterblatt, in a very quite street.There are two rooms: smoking and non smoking.Although i didnt eat, the people sitting on the table next to me had ordered a burger. I was drooling over it. it looked so delicious! (costs 7EUR60, with salad and fries on the side and free ketchup!) next time im there, im definitely having it!"
4,"I always come to this place when i get visitors in town.First of all, its the first pub/bar on the way to the schulterblatt. second of all I love the aquarium. don't ask me why? i just do. FYI, if you've never been there, there's an ""aquarium"" in the middle of the pub. Don't mistake it for a table. A couple of my visiting (girl)friends thought it was a table and 'pouf' put their bags into the water. Luckily no irreparable damages. Anyway beside this warning (and anecdote) do go there!Its nice, its fun, its packed, and its not too expensive!Happy hour till 22.00!"
3,"Solid dishes, impressive drink menu, and good service.Our party of 5 went with the family style approach of sharing a bunch of tapas. It seems like the right amount is somewhere around 2 to 3 tapas per person, probably closer to the 3 end if you're hungry. Food comes out pretty fast, though, so you could always start small and order more later.They have a ridiculous selection of liquors for the size of the restaurant. If they don't have your favorite, you're just way too picky.For a busy Saturday night, service was remarkably attentive and friendly. Our waitress checked in on us a few times as our party arrived (they'll seat you even if your party isn't entirely here yet). We were there with German-speaking friends, so not sure how good the wait staff's English is.The inside isn't large but handles the noise very well. The tables are well spaced out, and we didn't need to shout to hear each other even though the place was packed.Prices are a tad high, especially with the cocktails. I'm still calibrating to the Hamburg market, though, so this could be on par for this kind of establishment. With a cocktail per person and 2 bottles of wine, we ended at just under €40 per person. Makes for a good special dinner spot but probably not a regular option."
3,"What a delightful surprise!In a city centre populated by fast food joints, lousy service and that unmissable local ""attitude"" where it seems the customer is there to compliment the establishment and not the other way around, O-ren stands out.The food we ordered did take a long period to prepare, which is usually a good sign and one not to be taken for granted in this town. Finally there, we were all delightfully surprised how crunchy the vegetables were, delectable the meats and fresh the herbs tasted. Only slight drawback is the hectic service which is understandable since we were there during the lunch break. I think it might do the restaurant a world of good if they had more people manning the counters and tables during the prime time hours. Still they were friendly considering the influx of customers and long waiting line at the door. Still, we will definitely be regulars. Thanks for a good time."
3,"Whoa! Their pizza is HUGE. Luigis is such a cute little restaurant. it's a nice mix of cozy and hip. We had two glasses of red wine, a hot tea, a carbonara classico and pizza parma all for 40 euros. Amazing. I thought their carbonara was really good and it's nice without the sauce. It seems like they use fresh noodles here as well. The pizza parma had arugula and ham on it and it was pretty damn good too. Cheap, delicious, and I will be back."
2,"The boat was interesting, but I would definitely not do it again. The whole time all I could think was wow this would be bad if there was a fire and did they get these mannequins from the sex stores on the reaperbahn. Honestly the boat itself was very interesting to see, especially to see how small it was for the sailors. It would have been better if they either hadn't added in the mannequins and plastic food or spent the extra money to get realistic ones. It was actually pretty entertaining trying to find all the mannequins though."
2,"Have been to the Ganghi on many occasions and every single time we have had a great meal with excellent service. The staff have got to be some of the most friendly people I've met. Nothing was too much trouble, they even offered to prepare a dish I couldn't find on the menu. This has become one of my favourite places in Hamburg, especially good after being on the road all day and you just want great food and to wind down."
3,"Nice place to have good burger for lunch. Most of personnel speak English which is good. Prices are decent, also I would recommend to share fries with a friend, because I never manage to eat it myself. Only thing they're missing in my opinion is some Menu option (Burger+Fries+Drink), otherwise very nice place."
4,"Just perfect! I could not decide what to eat so I tried everything -aaahhh! Don't regret on single order. All was delish!! Eggs Florentine, vegan pancake, vegan french toast and vegan chocolate cupcake. Best breakfast for dinner I have had in a long while. Kind of glad I don't live here yet. Will definitely come back.You can sit outside or inside. Service is fast and very friendly. They speak German and English. Have great 80s-90s music running in the background. Really in love with the food. Only thing they are missing is glutenfree options. Hope they will add these. I am in love!! Restaurant is close to public transportation, too. You have to come here if you love breakfasts...even for dinner or any time of the day!"
0,"I have been to another Chinese Loving Hut in London, and this one was very disappointing. We went for lunch time, got the lunch deal (spring rolls or soup + a plate on the reduced menu for 6.90€). The tables weren't clean and we had to wait for 25 minutes before anyone came to get our order, but so far so good, I can live with that for the sake of good food for such a price! Sadly, our entries arrived (one soup and spring rolls) and they were barely warm. Our main course also looked re-heated. It wasn't hot, the texture of my sauce was as if the gelatine used to thicken had been cooled down and then re-heated, which caused it to be way too thick and glumpy - not good. The menu advertised that I would get seitan, though it really looked like a can mock-duck to me. The fried rice was tasty still, they can have that. We got our drinks halfway through the main course. Overall, it seems that depending on what you order, it's a hit or miss."
2,"Pretty nice pub in Grindel to hang around and listen to the chatter of expats. I like going to theme pubs/restaurants and this one is pretty well executed (though doesn't top the Turm Bar's tiki experience or the Bond's 007 atmosphere). I ordered the Spud Chips (which for some reason my colleague assumed to be thick fries, turns out they were really just potato chips) which were very nice, but I only received my order after waiting close to 20-25mins and having to remind the waitress that I hadn't actually gotten anything. I'd love to come back here for a bit of something to nash over a glass of beer - but won't come here if hungry. Reading the rest of the reviews, looks like slow service is the Down Under default."
4,"We ordered chili cheese fries for appetizer off the board. I had The Jack, it was delicious. The meat was cooked at perfect temperature and they put a pretty good amount of cheese. I was afraid the blue cheese would be too strong but it wasn't. I added an egg on my burger for the hell of it. The bread they use are English muffin which is a nice change."
4,"A small piece of jungles in the middle of Planten and Blumen. Exciting, if you are big fan of flora und fauna. Otherwise this place is not really big - two tropical rooms and one filled with cactuses. I was attracted mainly to cactus part of the garden. Basically you can get trough in like 10 min. But its entry free, so if you are in Planten und Blumen you should definitely give this place a try."
4,"Chicken chil/coconut dish was insane.  Excellent spring rolls ...  Menu changes every week, so expect something good"
4,"We fully enjoyed delicious, creamy pistachio ice cream in home made waffle. A ball of ice cream was surprisingly large, which makes this place very affordable. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. Last, but not least, a special feature for kids - there is a swing outside!"
4,"There are a lot of reviews, they all praise it. So do we. Enjoyed it, must go if you go to Hamburg. I would say it should be the reason for you to go to Hamburg, and you can also see other stuff in town.Service is top, WIFI is top, if you can arrange it go in November, January and February (as they guide told us), and during the week.Sunday it is always full and then you can have three rows in front of you. So if you can arrange it, come off-peak.Additionally book online upfront, so you don't have to wait."
4,"Really amazing place. If you arrive early, you can look in the gift shop (lots of chocolate, recipe books, and chocolate related things). The auto museum is also nearby. I took the English tour and it was really great. There are a lot of chocolate tastings along the way (think every time you stop you try something) and our guide was extremely helpful in answering all questions and very interesting (and spoke very good and clear English). Making your own chocolate bar is very fun (and you can sample the add-ons). It's also really interesting to try the chocolate at all steps of its preparation. I would definitely recommend doing this if you're in Hamburg. Be aware that you have to buy tickets for the tour time you want online (no rescheduling). I've left out pictures of the samples themselves because it's more fun to be surprised by them."
2,"So yes, the coffee here is quite good (although I would say that it still is a bit short of 'excellent'), and yes, their cakes and bagels are very good. However, I would still not easily recommend going here, mainly because of service issues. First of all we had to wait quite a while before finally being served, while our waitress was chatting away with a friend and other wait staff studiously avoided us - and we only got served after we walked over to her and asked her to take our order, after which either she or the kitchen managed to get us the wrong bagel. Furthermore, it's crowded and noisy and you will be hard pressed to find a comfortable place. All in all, the quality of the food and coffee is severely let down by the service and ambiance."
2,"The new Jim Block is really shiny looking, probably due to it's position next to the Alster where everything seems shiny and expensive. Thankfully the burgers are the same price as everywhere else. I should mention for those unfamiliar with the Jim Block franchise that they're a sort of classier fast-food burger joint. You get a real plate and cutlery and you can choose a beer as part of the meal-deal. The burgers are better than standard fast food burgers, and the fries are pretty decent too. If you want a quick burger I'd recommend this place. However, in the context of Jim Block restaurants, this one is super-busy. They don't seem to have any more staff though, and do the service really suffers. Last night there were 5 staff and only 2 people ahead of me in the line, but it still took me 10 minutes to get served. I shudder to think how long it'd take with a line out of the door (I have seen this)."
3,"Great place. However cooks do not know the difference between medium rare and medium. Tried to order medium rare like 5 times in  different Otto places, they always brought me medium/well done. Overall food it great, brioche bun is yum, truffle Mayo - thumbs up, stuff is nice too. And yes, they have great selection of craft beers!"
3,"I like the ambiente very much, never eaten there though, only nachos and it was very average. The beer is shots are nice!"
2,Not the best Hard Rock experience ever. Had to wait over an hour to get a table - on a Monday night in April? This was not high tourist season and it was midweek but there seemed to be an issue with service and the speed of the staff. Eventually got a table 90 mins later but the meal was very slow in being served too. Were they caught out and were short staffed? Who knows but it was 4 hours after we arrived that we finally left. Not good enough. Food was usual Hard Rock standard and no complaints about that but the service was not what you would expect.
3,Better than Va Piano since I can sit and wait for the food to be served at more less the same price. Go for the pizza.
3,Lieblings is located close to Reeperbahn. It has a variety of ice cream flavors. The ones I tried were all really good. Great place to stop by when visiting St. Pauli.
1,"As I am just a Polish turist, my opinion on those wurst is... not so amazing.If you wish to eat one hot sausage without any fork or knife, this is a place for you. Just an usual sausage in the middle of city centre. There are some tables available in nearby, but it is still in a middle of a busy pavement. I wasn't amazed, still what can you expect from such a dish for 3 EURO."
4,"First time having Curry Worst, my brother has had it many times and we both thought it was fantastic."
4,"Amazing presentation, delicious food, discreet service and lovely view  always forget how nice it is here!"
3,"La Sepia is located at the Sternschanze stop in Hamburg, which is filled with a bunch of hipster restaurants and boutiques. I liked the location cause La Sepia is right next to the Schanze's Sofa Bar (Zöe), so I can easily just walk on over after dinner to relax on a nice vintage sofa and enjoy some late night drinks. I had dinner on the night of a World Cup game so everyone was outside and all the restaurants were showing the game. It was really an event to see.The complimentary garlic dip at the beginning was okay, and a little bit on the saltier side, but when you're hungry and waiting on your food it doesn't necessarily matter. My boyfriend and I had the White Hauswein with our dinner. They brought our a bottle of it, and payment was calculated based on how much we actually drank, which I found to be liberating. I had the Paella Meeresfrüchte, which I definitely could've shared. The main problem with La Sepia is the wait and service. We waited for our food for over an hour and every time we asked about it, the server said he would go check on it and let us know, but he never came back. This happened about 3 times in one sitting. They would avoid us and it was just ridiculous. My boyfriend, who is a local, said that that was the norm of La Sepia. Make sure your BS tolerance is high the night you visit La Sepia. Otherwise, I would just come eat during lunch time to avoid the crowd."
4,"I an American from SD in the area for business.  I found this bar through Yelp.  I came on a Monday night and it was cozy and mostly empty.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The beer was great, the food was ok but I wasn't expect much for bar food. I returned on Thursday and the place was packed with locals.  The staff was different but still friendly.   It's a great place to hangout especially since there is not much else in the neighborhood."
2,"Ended up here to watch the world cup one evening and it was quite an interesting experienceto my left, a couple with a baby, on my right, a rawkus of Korean businessmen going at it like the world is ending on a bottle of something-or-other and their table grills. Every 5 minutes SLAM! and they all did a group shot.In the middle, myself and friends watching the game (and the businessmen) commenting on the fantastic English translations on their menu. I honestly can't remember what I ate, don't really like Korean food, but it was a good time and definitely memorable."
4,"Very good I had the big currywurst awsome a must visit while in Hamburg ,always packed"
2,"I was in Hamburg for work and was brought here by a local who seemed to eat there regularly. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was what you expect from an expensive Italian Restaurant. One weird thing was the only English menu on offer was on a giant chalk board. A waiter brought it round and we had to choose there and then. It was different, but fine and had no negative impact on our experience. The food I chose was very good. I had Dover sole that was really tasty and then at the end we shared a huge plate with one of each of their desserts in it. Again it was very nice. If you like Italian food then this place will probably appeal to you. Just be aware it was also on the pricey side."
3,"Even though I speak German, I'll write this review in English for our fellow travelers.We stopped here in summer of 2014 and had a great meal. Everyone in our family likes potatoes so we knew this was going to be good. One really awesome thing was that we were able to beg the waiter to get us some tap water. In case you don't know: No one serves just plain tap water in Europe and drinks of any kind are expensive. We were so thirsty after walking all around the city that we would have maxed out our credit card just on Cokes alone. The waiter kept bringing us carafes full of plain tap water and glasses for no charge - for that alone they have my eternal gratitude!I had the ""Florentiner Spinatauflauf"" - a florentine spinach and potato casserole. Along with the spinach and potato slices in a garlic cream sauce it was also covered in cheese and baked. It was incredibly good. My son had a variety of roasted potatoes and potato pancakes. I forgot what my wife and daughter ate, but it was also very good. We sat outside on the patio on account of the nice weather. Inside was very cozy and dark. Take your pick depending on your mood.If you love potatoes as much as we do, you should definitely try this place. They proudly make potatoes the centerpiece of everything!"
2,"Wildfleisch burgers! Too bad I did not know what wildfleisch was until I got home from my dinner at Edelsatt and decided to look it up. I definitely like the all around organic offerings at Edelsatt as well as the idea of a venison burger patty. I ordered the Edelsatt burger. This was a hamburger that called for the use of forks and knives. Not knowing it was venison, the patty did strike me as odd. It appeared to me that the venison meat was not grounded well enough, and then was smashed together into a burger patty; it was kind of like a piece of steak that fell apart to easily when you bit into it. It's hard to describe. There wasn't enough salt on the patty either for my taste. The bio bread was difficult to cut or even bite into. My burger devolved into a messy heap. I did like the mayo and the grilled onions. Others have complained about the fries, but I rather liked them a tad soft. I washed it all down with a rhubarb fritz cola. It was 9€ for the burger plus 3.50€ for the added fries and drink. The restaurant itself is a cool spot. I dig the decor. The food came out fast and the staff was very friendly. The hubby and I decided, possibly in unison, that we would likely not order the burgers again. That is, unless they make it feel more like an actual burger patty. I would like to try the currywurst, so I'll be coming back at least for that."
3,"Food = awesome and that is my main motivation to come here. Service is hit or miss and when outside seating isn't possible, the berlin-hipster interior style isn't so much my thing. But if you're coming for the food, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a super hungry boy. You might need a starter then too, so I hear). Enjoy!"
4,Excellent food and service. Nice location with plenty of outside seating. Great jazz music and local beer on tap. Strongly recommend.
4,"I had a great time here, the bartender knows his job. In the end he made me a Mojito with a Chocolate taste. That was Wonder full. When I'm back in Hamburg i will defintaly go back"
4,"I'm a massive fan of the Stadtpark, and now summer is just around the corner, I'm inspired to tell you why. For a decent program, I'd highly recommend renting a canoe and paddling your way through the canal network into the Stadtparksee, where you can promptly jump in (without paying!) and swim to shore. Then unload your picnic, beers and size 6 cricket set, and a happy afternoon will be had by all. It's advisable to use a windball instead of the real thing, lest you kill a baby and put a dampener on everything."
4,best rolls in town! check kleine-konditorei.com
4,"It is, in fact, as good as they say it is. After hearing for years about how great the bread in Germany is, I've been disappointed now that I actually live here. All of the bakeries seem to churn out the same crappy, lifeless, factory-made bread (and/or pastry). Not so at this bakery.I happened upon Die Kleine Konditorei by happenstance; my mechanic is nearby, and I needed something to do for 30 minutes while they worked on my car. They pointed me here, and I will be forever grateful.I was surprised at first to see a line out the door when I arrived on a random Tuesday morning. In my experience, Germans don't queue for anything, so this must be a good spot. I tried the most German croissant I could find... a sunflower seed pretzel croissant, and it was amazing. I also had a tiny little cheese/bacon puff that looked good (and was).Anyway, delicious baked goods, good prices, long lines. Seems worth it to me. I'll be back."
2,Discent burger restaurant whom also serve a salads - the Cesar salad comes without any chicken so you have to order that on the side (well most of the salads is without protein :-))Would have loved to taste there dessert unfortunately there where no hot chocolate left when we finished our main course. They have home made drinks (non alcoholic) which is very good.
2,"I had a nice solo lunch at this Bok! I read about it on Yelp as being a fairly decent and relaxed place for Asian food. The menu is in German and English. I had a chicken dish with yellow curry and various veggies, it came with a side of white rice. They claim it's one of the spicy dishes - I'd argue that, but, I'm from Oakland, California, where there are 10 spicy Asian restaurants within a block radius of my house - and we're spoiled. So when I come to Northern Europe and get ""spicy"" food it's often not spicy. But, it was warm and tasty and the restaurant had great music playing. I enjoyed it - I just needed something quick and warming in between work. Thanks Bok for delivering it! (And yes, too many locations in one area..very confusing :) )"
4,"delicious ramen! perfect ramen texture, tasty soup with fresh ingredients. fast service and affordable pricing."
2,"Welcome to the Auswanderermuseum BallinStadt in Hamburg aka museum about emigrantion.First of all: I will not join the overall praise for this museum. Now, 3 days after I visited it, I still think the quality of the exhibition is pretty mixed.I visited it with friends, both fluent in English and German, and we switched languages depending on which seemed to get us quicker through, because the museum was pretty crowded on the day of our visit.We both had intermediate to advanced knowledge of German history and emigration waves from Germany. I don't know how much you would get our of the exhibition if you are just searching for information where your ancestors are from. That's because the exhibition is pretty inconsistent. Albeit, the general layout makes sense: Situation in Germany and Eastern Europe  Migration waves  Destinations - the development of the ships and the ship passage  Entering the new country (with a special focus on Ellis Island)  Immigration Countries other than the USA/Canada (Brazil, Australia)  famous immigrants who've made it.In another building the history of the BallinStadt is told, with the situation which led to the building of the barracks, their short-lived fate from 1901-1914 and the seemingly even shorter time between WW I and WW II. Plus the story about the back-then CEO of HAPAG, the shipping company that invented ship cruises and got big by shipping immigrants over the Big Pond.About the flaws in the concept:English vs. German:Everything is labelled in English in German, but the German label dominate, the English is always a bit shorter and layouted in a smaller font.Bigger picture vs. individual story:In the beginning you are confronted with six individuals, which should guide you through the exhibition and tell you their story. They literally tell you their story, which might be longer with the one and quicker with the other. Unfortunately you cannot skip  when you dialled the wrong language, you have to wait until they are finished. On crowded days, you have to stand in line, there are only two earphones per puppet, and you can dial only one language at a time for both earphones.And in the end you find out the six individuals don't really guide you through. You just see them back at the end of the exhibition, then they tell you what their life is like not that they are away from home for a couple of month or years. There is no alternative way to find out about their fate, you either wait and here or you don't find out about them.During the different stages of the migration, there are different individuals who show up and just present one piece of information, you don't get informed what their background is, et cetera. So if they already put such an efford in telling an individual's story, why don't they use it to describe the different stages of emigration better?History of BallinStadtThere is a lot of pictures and exhibition objects which are not labelled, and you might only get the meaning of it later on, if you get it.Conclusion:Ok, we learned a lot, and I think for kids it might be funny to run through a ship which changes from early 18th century to early 20th century within a few meters. But there is a lot that is forbidden to touch (not a good idea with kids). The fact that a lot of exhibition objects are not labelled and you might learn to know what it was waaayyy later is annoying.The entrance fee is 12 EUR, which is not cheap. As the museum is not publicly funded, it is heavily sponsored, f.e. by Ancestry.com. This is a bit ironic, because the digitalization of the archieves is publicly funded, so it is a strange kind of private-public partnership."

4,"Some weeks ago, we noticed that this Vietnamese restaurants is full of people and tried it ourselves  result: best in town! Since my last trip to Vietnam, I haven't had such good soup noodles (Pho) which becomes even more tasty the colder it gets outside. The summer role and dry noodles (Bun) are also very authentic. Besides, they offer a few different dishes every week as well as some interest drinks. Price-wise: EUR 6,50 for a full bowl of noodles  very reasonable! The team is friendly and in very good control of the full house (people often cue outside but the food doesn't take long at all). We are now a frequent visitor at this place and look forward for next quick fix between shopping or after work."
4,"Wild experience.  I got to the museum an hour before it closed, which was not enough time.  I would recommend 2.5 hours to look around the extensive exhibits - especially considering they are open very late.  It seems a little pricey, but is well worth it.  There are different rooms dedicated to towns around Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.  You can also see offices where people are building the models.  I would recommend the place even if you do not have a special interest in trains!"
3,"I had seen this place a couple times when at cafes or restaurants nearby but always passed as it was so full. This is obviously a good sign. We weren't disappointed. Came for breakfast on a Sunday and sat outside. Service is great and very attentive. The younger girl was super nice and the lady who was in the kitchen (and came out here and then to bring dishes) was also very pleasant. The food was great. We had a mix of breakfast options plus a piece of cheesecake at the tail end plus coffee and fresh mint teas. Everything was prepared with care and tasted really good. What I didn't like is that basically everything was reserved, even at an early hour and basically, a lot of tables sat empty for quite a while unused. Later on though, it was packed and I had noticed that some people would of have liked to take a seat but didn't as all tables were supposedly taken. One can't avoid this with such a small space but it could be managed a bit better in my opinion. Otherwise, we'll definitely be back (with a reservation) and will do our best to enjoy their front terrace area as when the weather is nice, this is the best option."
2,"Not really for my taste, i think it was a bit overpriced for what we got. Ambient was nothing special. The staff was actually very nice and friendly"
3,Good place to eat. Sometimes jut to crowded and so it's not easy to find a place to sit. To order goes pretty fast. The atmosphere is not the best. But good food weighers it out.
2,"Finally managed to come here a couple of times. It's the after-work place for drinks if you are in town. We showed up once and it was empty. By the time we left, an hour later, it was packed, both inside and outside. The bartendars are pretty cool and seem to remember you if you've come in more than once. The guy I was having drinks with knew them pretty well and service was promt with good mixing. I simply don't like the location as it's pretty poorly placed and hence also small. Also a bit of a weird crowd tends to show up hence it's a bit hit or miss on whom you meet here. The two times I was there it definitely tended also towards a sausage fest hence ladies, perfect for you. Not necessarily a singles bar as it was originally described to me. I thought this would be an interesting aspect but it never really panned out this way. Drink prices are good though during happy hour so I'd recommend trying it out."
3,"Near the Hbf in Hamburg and it's worth a short walk for a 4 euro meal, and 5 if you get an Ayran! Durum is like a giant burrito with chicken and beef, assorted veg and sauce. Ask for ""scharf"" or spicy and it has a nice little kick. Is it a 4 star meal? Not even close, but for a fast and filling meal before hopping on a train or after a stadtrundfahrt this is a deal. You could even split a durum and it would fill up two people and save even more money! I'm not on a budget, but I liked what I found here. Enjoy!"
4,Eins meiner Top 3 Lieblingsrestaurants in Winterhude. Die Trüffel Pasta ist himmlisch! Der Service wirklich sehr gut. Im Sommer kann man gut draußen sitzen. Drinnen ist es sehr gemütlich und klassisch eingerichtet. Kann ich nur wärmstens weiter empfehlen.
3,"Moraba is a nice bar in the schanze. Not particularly special, but certainly gets most things right. I guess the reason that I'm so blasé is because after you've been to one, you've sort of been to most of the bars in the area - they are all good, but not many stand out."
3,"The smallest venue Ive probably ever been to- so small you have to exit and wait out front when bands are setting up their gear on stage- which can be rather cold in the winter... Cool little place under the railway lines which generally has shows from local or small bands on tour- 6 Euros will usually get you in a show- which is a great way to discover new music in a cool environment. The Astra Stube seems like a Hamburg instuition of sorts and they almost had to close this December, but were able to extend their lease for a few more years- so go support local/independent live music!"
3,This is a very nice thai and sushi restaurant at the Lange Reihe close to the main station. The staff was kind and the food tasted good. The prices are okay. It was pretty crowded and we were lucky to get the last table. It is probably better to reserve a table in advance.  The entrance is even to the ground.
3,"This is our neighborhood restaurant. It is quite simple, but it has a lot of charm. It is a family owned restaurant, run by very nice and friendly people. You are kinda transported to another place, where the children can play on the sidewalk, and everybody knows each other (and we kinda do, because we are also kinda neighbors). So if you live close to here, or are close to the restaurant, come over and sit outside."
3,"Great sushi with perfect size, awesome concept of IPad ordering and friendly staff! All you can eat for 25 Euros = 5 orders of your choice times*10= 50 orders over 150 minutes. The industrial feeling mixed with a Japanese touch goes well together. For the dessert I can recommend the green-tea ice-cream as a perfect end of a great dinner."
1,"Recommended by many in Hamburg for some strange reason.  If at one point this was a top restaurant, those days are gone. Passable Italian food torpedoed by indifferent, insufferable, lackadaisical service. Do not want to be unfair to the kitchen, even if the food is not all that either, but the main topic of conversation between me and my dinner partner was the poor experience at Gallo Nero.  They do have cute empty bottles of wine lining the walls."
4,A very nice restaurant selling southern german food. The dishes are very tasteful! The athmosphere is nice and the staff is great! You have to order the food at the counter and then it will be brought to your table.
2,"After eating here twice and the restaurant next door (Falafelstern) twice, I'm not impressed by the taste of the food at Kimo, so I'd definitely recommend going next door for falafel instead. I've ordered the large falalplatter here twice, which for 5.50 euro comes with a large variety and decent quantity of food. The falafel is decent tasting, and five balls are included. There's also a basket provided with a few pieces of flat pita.Kimo does have more choices and a less fast-food feeling, but I'd still go to Falafelstern hands-down because I find the falafel and other ingredients much tastier."
3,"We did the English tour at 10am today, was great and very entertaining. Most was in English so it was easy to understand (a couple of things were in German but it didn't take away from the experience). There were a few laughs, a few screams and all out fun. If you don't speak German it's essential that you book in for one of the English tours.Only negative was the fun photo at the beginning didn't work and it took almost halfan hour for us to get another one taken"
2,"I wasn't impressed by this place at all outside of the fact that it's a pretty cool location with trendy interior design. Was here for lunch and have avoided coming for dinner having been forewarned that service is horrible. At lunch they have basic fare. This is not gourmet food by far. Nevertheless I enjoyed my lunch but wasn't blown away by it at all. Service was OK but also not going out of their way to please. Prices were also quite fair considering that this is a restaurant owned and run by a TV chef. Still though, you have to provide better if you want to attract people with your popularity on TV. Getting people in the door and then just basically offering things that everyone nearby has isn't going to cut it. I wanted more in regards to food. They managed to get the decor right but it would of been easy to have really creative food and great service. This place would draw even larger crowds than it does now simply based on popularity of the owner. Maybe once it loses it's ""newness"" they may focus more on the food and employees yet until then I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."
4,Great place to it with a very affordable price. I think they recently change their chef which now is not as good as it used to be but is still okay
4,"I'm always a little leery of expensive restaurants with a great view. Most of the time it feels like you're only paying for the view and the food is an afterthought. Not the case here. The food is fresh, innovative and fantastic. The service is great. The view is amazing."
2,"We ate here at lunch time. It was busy but as we arrived early we were served speedily. I enjoyed my meal and the waiter was friendly. Ok its not the best Italian restaurant I have visited but if you are nearby and want something pleasant to eat , it will fit the bill"
4,"I'm now a regular patron of Mr. Kebab. It can't really be beaten. You can get a really great (and rather large) donner wrap for EUR3, or perhaps a few skewers of lamb/chicken with rice, bread and veg for EUR7. If that isn't enough there's a huge mountain of meat and salad which is EUR20 ish between two. You'll never finish it though. The toilets are also worth mentioning. It's like some crazy freaked out disco in there - what's that all about?!"
4,"We went to Meine Kleinraumdisko the other day after a hard night's drinking gluhwein at the DOM. A few friends were over from the UK, and one had brought a bottle of ""Pendle Witch's Brew"" as a present (see photos). Unfortunately being completely drunken the beer was lost during the course of the night... that was 5 days ago. On the off-chance that it was still there and had been saved from consumption, we turned up there last night. Amazingly they had found it and kept it! (see photos) The place itself is a cool little bar that I always think of as being on feldstrasse, but is actually on the bit that is called Neuer Kamp. Very confusing. The decor is 70s-styled wallpaper and disco lights. The music is chilled and there are loads of sofas to lounge about on. As far as I'm concerned the beer is Augustina."
4,"It's nice to see that these formally vacant wharehouses and been modernised and used as offices, studios and small businesses. Speicherstadt houses Hamburg Dungeons and the impressive indoor model railway. A short walk from Landungsbrucken or a bus ride from the city centre."
3,"Pretty cool Swedish restaurant near Stadthausbrücke! Relaxing atmosphere, cheap price and fast served food! The only thing is u have to get forks and knifes by yourself which is total fine compared to the price and quality of food u get. I'll recommend the chicken legs and beef balls. Taste quite good :D Nice place for a lunch break if u work near by."
4,One of my favourite places! Always get he chicken tikka and samosas!  Nice food for a cheap price! It can be really crowded and a bit of a wait when you go at a busy hour but at the right time it's great!
3,"I had the Labskaus, I think a Hamburg dish that looks like boiled beef and has the consistency of mashed potatoes. The restaurant and food are fine, but more notable is the street where it's located. My coworker tells me Deichstraße is one of the oldest streets in Hamburg, and the origin of the big fire of 1842 that burned down half the city. You can sit out front if the weather's nice, or take one of the alleyways around back for a great view of the canal and surrounding architecture after dinner."
3,"It's not the most intimate or convivial décor - it's very ""hotel-y"".The staff are extremely attentive and helpful.Absolutely excellent gin and tonics, and their bar has an impressive selection.The burgers are some of the best I've had so far in Germany (...not as good as a *really good* burger in America, but very tasty) and the allumette (""matchstick"") fries are a little crispy, salty, delicious cone-full of heaven. Can't wait to try their selection of various proteins tartare (next time!). It's pricey - good for a treat.Edit:  I've had the steaks here once or twice now, too. The meat is high quality, but drastically suffers from typical German under-seasoning. I'd stick with the burgers."
4,So good... one of the best Mexican restaurants in Hamburg! Delicious food and welcoming service.
1,"Location is nice but the lady who served us was very unprofessional and hostile.The manor in which the order was taken made us feel unwelcome. Some of our orders came out wrong and she argued with us instead of offering to fix it.The food was fine but not worth dealing with this particular member of staff.Very disappointed with the service, I can not recommend."
1,"Was there yesterday, February 16, 2019. Had traveled from Sweden and booked a table several months before. The food gets a strong four but the overall impression made them get two stars. There were so many mistakes in the service of the person who served us. She didn't smile, first of all. We got the impression we were not welcome. We got bread but the restaurant couldn't fix drinks that were not on the menu. While drinking our pre-drink we got the starter. We didnt have time to enjoy either pre-drink or the starters seperatly. At this time the main course came in. A Henssler mix - their specialty, with sashimi, sushi, tempura. We still hadn't finished our drink, nor our starters. Now we also lacked the beer we were supposed to have with the starter. Our waitress did not present the main course, which was strange because there was a mix of a lot of different components. The waitress was still quite unengaged. She forgot the drink for the main course. We had to ask for it twice before it arrived after 30 minutes. Then we had come halfway through our main course.When we had finished our entire dinner - from the moment we were seated at our table to we got the check - it had been 50 mins. We dissapointed and went back to our hotel for coffee and desert."
4,Just discovered this place tonight. Very good Pho soups and hot ginger tea. Staff very friendly. Prices also very reasonable. Great to have such a place in the Innenstadt.
2,"Noah's is a nice enough little restaurant on Grosse Neumarkt, but it didn't seem special when I visited last night. When we went inside it was noticeable that we were the only guests there - Admittedly it was a Monday night, but still. The menu is small, which is fine, but the prices are quite a bit higher than the only other greek restaurant that I've been to in Hamburg, and sadly the food is worse On the up-side they're not too far from where I work and they have a competitively priced lunch menu, so I'll probably come back and try that sometime."
0,"Sorry to have to give this restaurant one star.  Ate there for lunch twice, one week apart, in July 2017.  First lunch visit I ordered the vegetarian lunch menu.  The taste of the food was fine but an hour later I was running to the toilet.  i thought, things happen, something I ate didn't agree with me.I went back exactly a week later and this time I ordered the Chicken lunch menu.  Same thing happened.I will not be going back.  Sorry."
4,"A MUST for a visitor in Hamburg ist the City-Hall. Build in the end of the 19th century it was to be a monument against NOBILITY. Hamburg was to become ONE with the German EMPIRE under the rule of emperor Wilhelm II.Almost all other parts of Germany were Kingdoms, ruled by Kings, Dukes and Earls. Hamburg was a free city, ruled by merchands. It was incredibly important for Hamburg's political society to make a statement. HAMBURG is level with NOBILITY. The city build a townhall to conquer all questions. 11 years of building time, countless people, who took influence. A decade, in which art was turned upside-down. ... Lost documentary, almost 700 rooms... This building is sooo incredible, so unknown yet ... a MUST-SEE."
3,"Went to Carls while staying at the Westin hotel on a business trip. Was confused first about where to enter. The front is more a small bar but the back is the Brasserie for dinner. After we cleared this confusion we sat down for a good dinner. Service was good and uncomplicated. Had the Codfish (skreifisch) dinner which was delicious and well prepared. Waiter was attentive and just when we felt that it was time to go he showed up with the bill. He was reading his customers well. Menus are in German (not an issue for me) but a place like this could benefit from an English version of the menu. I heard servers English spoke. Conversation going on, so we were not unique in that regard."
3,"went with a Groupon Gutschein, great food and live pan on the table!!"
3,"Visited here looking to cure some homesickness, since Hawaii is basically Japan-lite. I ordered gyoza and chashu shoyu ramen, my friend had the kimchee shoyu ramen. The gyoza were very tasty but the meat inside, like other asian ground meat I've had in Germany, had a finer, grainer consistency than I'm used to. That said, the flavor was excellent.Both shoyu ramens had a rich flavor which was lovely to eat inside while listening to the cold rain outside. However, I think the soups should've been kept at a hotter temperature. Also, each bowl only had one leaf of bak choy and very few condiments otherwise. There was plenty of meat in my chashu bowl which I guess is the ""best"" part, but I like some more greens, too! Where's the nori? Is that just a Hawaii-Japanese thing?The ambiance is very calm, quiet, Japanese. Like I said earlier, sitting inside with ramen and hot gyoza is perfection when the weather is crappy out. Price was reasonable, too, whole meal was about 31 euro."
2,"Essen und Wein super - Service fällt dagegen stark ab. Wen's nicht stört ist hier super aufgehoben, um ehrlich italienisch zu essen."
3,"Haifisch Bar is such an archetype of a Hamburg harbour bar that it almost hurts to see its raw realness. Loads of dusty, mysterious memorabilia all over the place. Reminding you of the good old days when the rough sailors were there on shore leave for strong drinks, picking fights and the girls. The furniture and bar are very old-fashioned - but not in that trendy retro way, it just IS original. A bar, some stools, a few tables and that's it.The lady behind this bar is profesionally friendly and nothing like the big-mouthed trollop you'd expect. Drinks are free of any glamour so you'd get your plain Astra or Jever. Prost!I have also been there for a 2 funky fiestas thrown by a business friend for their clients. So apparently there was food involved for the media people, too. And guess what? It was home-style cooking à la Hamburg: a buffet consisting of meatballs, bread rolls with fish, fish cake and potato salad. And everybody liked it.. as spoilt as they may be. Amazing!Maybe some thought this place was especially set up for them as a big spectacle?! So it's definitely worth checking out even though it can get pretty touristy (No photography allowed!). But if you wish to experience the real Hamburg, please do go."
3,"I brought a group of 9 on a Saturday with a last minute reservation for 8, which normally doesn't work because they're usually full. So I was worried, but it was surprisingly quiet that evening and we got a very nice room to ourselves with room for many more than our single tag-along guest. We were fortunate.But such popularity comes at a cost. I don't remember the prices being so high and the portion sizes so small for dishes which are relatively simple to prepare. €3.50 for a side of Bratkartoffeln. It couldn't have been more than 1 potato. (See photo)The service was excellent, as I expected it would be. Very observant waiters with a sense of humor. Although if you have a problem with your food (my friend didn't like the Pulled Pork Burger -- not enough BBQ flavor, which I agree with) they will look at you surprised and defend it and discuss it and deny it until finally they offer something to compensate. But that's typical of every Hamburg restaurant I've been to in the last 6 years. Even the foreign restaurants adopt this local attitude that nothing can ever be wrong with their food.But I have to reduce my review to 4 stars because, while the food is generally good and the service great (by German standards), they appear to be positioning themselves as something exclusive and gourmet by serving more porcelain than food and then charging an arm and a leg for it -- which would only be justifiable if the dishes were delicacies."
4,"The food here is unique. It is austrian with some traditional German plates. They were very friendly, even finding us a table without a reservation. A recommendation : make a reservation at first, just to be safe. They are also happy to have dogs there. To get there by public transport, ones can take the S1 to poppenbüttel or bus 8 to poppenbüttel Bahnhof and walk from there."
4,"I love visiting the Central Park in the summer. Classified a beach club, the Central Park has just about anything you'd expect from a beach club, but without the waves. Sand, beach chairs, table tennis, grill catering, popsicles, tall glasses of Weizen and evening shows. The prices at the grill are moderately alright, they serve a good cup of coffee and an excellent Flammkuchen! The Central Park is open until 23:00 in the summer (as a matter of fact, it's open only in the summer) and is pretty full up until the last minute, especially on the hot summer weekends. My favorite time to to is on a workday evening or a Sunday afternoon. Recommended as a nice alternative to, well, everything else in the Schanze, a nice place to kick back with some friends, have a light lunch/dinner and drink some beer.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=qqjR…"
3,"Great place. Nice view to the B+V docks, good variety of drinks, nice food. Stinky toilets."
3,"good, solid Chinese food -- if you're hungry, you'll be happy you came to this great neighbourhood find.the restaurant itself is unassuming; it's big enough but not fancy.  service was friendly and quick when asked for, and the food came out fresh and fast. the vegetables were delicious, and all the meats we had were done tenderly and flavorfully.  prices are fair, and you do get a good portion.  as with most Chinese restaurants, the menu is designed for family-style eating  there is also a lunch menu that is served from 11am-5pm.my peeps come from Shanghai, so i never got my tastebuds trained for Sichuan-style spicy, so much of this menu was a bit off-limits to me.  however, there are plenty of non-spicy options and i can say they are all yummy!  the restaurant is off of the main street Eiffestrasse, behind a car rental place."
3,"Not accurately Mexican food, but very tasty and very inspired by it nonetheless. Tasty sauces with great tortilla chips, spicy burritos.We love to order from here.If your aren't lookin for authentic tacos, you are good here. They do not have any tacos unfortunately."
3,"I have been to Hamburg so many times that I thought I knew the city.Apparently, I can't be further away from being wrong. This museum - that is located on beautiful park with idyllic lake teaches you all about Hamburg and its history. It's located not far from U-bahn stop St. Pauli, so it can't get any easier than that, not to mention it's not far should you be interested to check out all the ""interesting"" entertainment on the infamous Reeperbahn.Again, dragged by my history and museum geek boyfriend, I came here by force (if not by free will) although I wasn't literally kicking and screaming. If it were up to me, I'd rather spend my time at Monckebergstrasse, but oh well - I guess a little history won't hurt.This museum has very interesting models of pretty much everything in Hamburg. At least you won't be bored by history by looking at interesting teeny weeny intricate models. It taught you what Hamburg really was back then when some Christian missionaries (and bishops) chose to settle here and named the town Hammaburg. It's almost like reading it on wikipedia, but with a lot of cute models. See? not boring.The layout of the museum was cool too and they had a room full of model ships just like in Copenhagen's Orlogsmuseet, and the most cool about this museum is that on the top floor, they have a working railway model of Hamburg in the scale of 1:32. That was amazing to watch. They did have people operating the trains and all. I felt like I went back to my childhood again.On the basement floor they had small exhibition of what Hamburg was like under Nazi reign, along with recreation of shops, places under World War II. Very interesting.All in all, a very interesting place to visit, especially if you're interested about history....and oh, did you know that Reeperbahn literally means the rope way? It's where back in the yore they made ropes for the ships. See? More knowledge of history here! I'm getting like 1% smarter than before... :P"
2,"Regional food from Franken (Nürnberg) - northern bavaria. The roasts are very good, bratwurst and a nice selection of beers (try meister). Roast potatoes are fried not roasted - minus one star"
4,I went there last month for the first time to take my after-lunch-coffee. nice little cafe near to the campus with delightful turkish food. My all time favourite for lunch is the self made PIDE  tastes great. yummy!
3,"Great beer, and good selection of dishes to go with it. the staff is friendly and very polite."
0,"That was the worst food poisoning for mussels I ever had in my life, almost survived! Do not recommend this kitchen at all."
3,"Sofabar is one of those classic hang-out bars which every good city has. Like everyone has mentioned, this place is just one huge room with a bunch of sofas to park on while enjoying your Astra, cocktail or whatever your drink of choice is. A very laid back vibe, even if on Friday/Saturday nights it can get rather busy. Prices are fair (2.40 for an Astra). They usually spin good music, which is just loud enough to have a conversation over. The lighting adds to the atmosphere and the large glass windows makes it a good place to watch whats going on on the street from the comfort of an old couch ;). Overall one of my favorite places to have a beer in Hamburg."
4,"We have been here several times and really like it for grabbing a quick bite on the way out to do something or when coming home and wanting to grab something quick.I usually have the number eleven chicken wrap and like to get a couple of pieces of haloumi  chucked in, this is a tasty combo.We also really rate the falafel teller, all the flavours and textures on it really go well together.There is coffee and cold drinks (most importantly Spezi)There is seating inside and out, and a customer toilet.  The guy running the place is also very pleasant."
4,"Holy cow!  What a great meal. We were off to a rough start with a small language barrier and seating. (We we're asked to change tables twice). But it really didn't matter in the end because everyone was great. The restaurant is small and got very busy. You should make reservations. The food was excellent and fresh. Kudos to the staff that seemed all family, but I'm not sure. Go here if you are in the area."
0,There really are NO DISGUSTING words that I could possibly muster to perfectly describe what a horrible place this was! From the get go the waiter was such crabby old man- I asked for hoisin sauce he looked at me like I was asking for marinara sauce! Later to give it time I asked for some ice to cool the €9 euro bottle of water that was room temperature & he literally rolled his eyes at me- Seriously? Ok whatever- just bring the dim sum out and be done with it- a few plates of mediocre fare later he brings out what should have been the highlight- Sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf- we carefully unwrapped the steamy hot item only to find what looked like a massive dung with no discernible rice grains to speak of- just a big brown turd of mush- still I dissected it as supposedly it contained chicken- which at the very center was a dried up tasteless chicken wing- bone in and just GROSS! I called the crabby old man over and lied that while we enjoyed the other items that this was just inedible- thank you please retire it from the table- which he did- I felt bad for having returned something so I asked for another small plate of dim sum to make up for it- but when the bill came to my surprise he had charged me for the lotus wrapped pile of ... and so I said to him- I'm sorry but you forgot to remove this from my bill- and he insisted that he would not take it off my bill that I HAD TO PAY!  I was indignant at how utterly preposterous this was- I have rarely returned anything and when I have the service has been apologetic and settled quickly- the crab would not let up and the scene he was making in the restaurant had me on pins and needles- there's a price for dignity and it was obvious his was €6 euros! NEVER EAT HERE if you're in Hamburg! Try the Dim Sum Haus literally around the corner! Bon Appetit! Just NOT at the Mei Moon-
4,this place is awesome for kids and adults.  Its amazing how much detail went into creating all the miniature trains and figures.  The new airport model is in a class in its own and I watched it for half an hour before my girl friend pulled me away.  This is a must see attraction in Hamburg*this place often gets full quick but you can make a time reservation so you don't have to stand in line.  The later evening times have less people and are more enjoyable.
4,"Probably one of the most unique things you'll see in your life. Worth seeing! The airport section is just incredible! Perfect for anyone: family, couple, friends."
3,"Met a good friend here for a coffee. It was Sunday and packed and rightly so! The coffee was very good and the atmosphere was very nice, not quite what I expected from the area. I did not try any of their food offerings, but the nice man next to me seemed to truly enjoy his chocolate cake. I also noticed that they had a Brunch Bar out, and that families were helping themselves to the emptying selection (it was after 13:00). Looking forward to my next time back! Check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"Great place, thanks yelp!Cute, authentic and very cosy inside spread over 2 floors with a mezzanine.Had a quick dinner here with my sister before heading to the airport.Had one with mushrooms and a fried egg on top. Super tasty & filling for about 9€!"
3,Pretty good Pho which is perfect for Hamburg's normal overcast weather. I too love their spring rolls!
1,"Overrated Italian restaurant, expensive, laud and busy. My chair was in the middle of the corridor and every time the waiters were hitting on me. The risotto was quite a strange one, couldn't finished it. And the pasta of the day looked like the pasta of last week. Not al dente but overcooked, without personality and taste I was expecting in a family Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Not a place to come back."
3,"Part lobster and fish dealer, part seafood canteen - Hummer (lobster) Pedersen is an institution down in the commercial fish market area.Seating is casual and busy, service efficient; patrons at lunch are a mix of business people from the neighboring office buildings and tourists.Dishes are simple (think fried fish with potatoes; oysters with some shallots at the side; tuna tartare; plain cooked and opened lobster with hot butter at the side) and effective for it. Their wines are very well selected. All at not cheap, but very fair prices.Do yourself a favor and eat here rather than at the garage-style fish roll outlets up the street who will probably even serve their spiny lobster with crude mayonnaise and french fries at the same price..."
4,"Busy meat lovers restaurant, good atmosphere, friendly service. Quite expensive but worth the money as the steak is good quality, you can even watch them cook your steak for you! Jacket (Baked potato) is served with steaks and is very tasty!"
3,"Had a late lunch here with family after an appointment at UKE. Service was great and we ordered a biryani, baingan bharta and Punjabi paneer. All three items were very delicious. I will go there again on a special occasion."
3,"Very nice little Pizza place in Talstraße, just a few steps away Dron the Reeperbahn. It's definitely not easy to eat inside because of its size (during summer there are some more seats outside though) but pizza is good and quite cheap. Give it a try of you are in the Reeperbahn area and you are hungry!"
3,"Nice little, or actually rather big, corner café in this not too busy part of the city. I guess by nice little I mean relaxing, which Vesper is on the inside, but I wouldn't sit outside, not during rush hour at least. The owner and her staff are very attentive, interior design is ordinary yet charming somehow. The great thing about this place is its two modes, come evening it gets more restaurant-like. Coffee is good and the selection of draught beer is ample for a café."
4,"Really nice pho and ambitious pricing. It doesn't get better than this. I tried the hamburg version, and it's filled with all sorts of goodies, as you would expect from a pho."
4,"I came here on a recommendation by a friend that this was the best coffee in townI now wholeheartedly agree! The latte was so excellent, it made a Starbucks creation seem like a gas station cup of joe in comparison. Moreover, the chocolate chip cookie was the closest I've had to American style in Germany (although heating it up a tad wouldn't have hurt.) It's a small and cozy place, and rather quiet, which had a drawback: I had the unfortunate experience of encountering elderly clientele there who were reading newspapers and thus thought it was perfectly appropriate to ask fellow coffee drinkers to remain silent due to this. I can only hope they had gotten lost on their way to the library. Nevertheless, I can't blame the shop! A+ coffee here, even if just for a delicious to-go cup."
4,THE BEST SAUSAGES IN TOWN !! A MUST for visitors and locals. Ideally located for shopping and a quick snack
3,"I love the taste of the coffee, the cake, the Alster view, everything. Service is nice. A little more smile would give 5 stars :)"
4,"Stopped by for a quick takeout order today. Super friendly, polite, and clean place. I ordered the dürum and as always it was tasty. Definitely recommend this spot for lunch."
4,"Great customer service, cozy interior and excellent food. The food portions are big, so you will definitely not leave hungry.I had the Labskaos , which was delicious, and so were the pancakes I shared with my boyfriend. Totally recommended! 5/5 stars"
4,"Beautiful, spacious restaurant in the basement of Hamburg's historic city hall building. Unlike most city hall restaurants in Germany, this one is relatively fancy with excellent service and great food and drinks. Compared to other restaurants of its class in Hamburg it is downright cheap. The food is mostly modern interpretations of traditional Hamburg and North German dishes. Great place to take a date!"
2,I was a bit disappointed by the breakfast on offer but the cakes were good. Coffee not so good. Very nice mood though and lovely interiors.
4,I was at this qrito last Sunday and I must say I was impressed. I have been having serious withdraws from Mexican food (I am from San Diego) I could never find a place. I ordered a carnitas burrito and filled it up with all kinds of fresh fillings. It's pretty much a Mexican subway and I like that style very much. Heading there today to get a second taste!!
4,Nr. 88 +++++
3,"Ahoi itself isn't a luxury place, there not much design about this place. It seem more like a coffee to me, but they also offer some food. They also offers really nice view of the Hamburger Hafen, at the same time, can catch up with friends.Because of it this place is quite popular at the weekend, at least when we were there, it was full of people. Luckily we was able to find free spot to sit down. The place is self-service, have to go inside to order. When the pizza is really, the stuff will bring it out and shout the order number, that's how it works here.For me, I really like it here. Having a lovely drink with such a beautiful harbour in the sunny day. It's really enjoyable. If it isn't too windy, I could stay there for the whole day."
3,"Having moved recently near to this location we finally were able to try it out. I had heard of the place fairly soon after it opened but the opportunity to visit simply didn't present itself. Well, now it had.There has been enough written about this location in German so I won't go into too many specifics. High-end location with lots of windows. Modern design with well spaced out tables. I found the ambiance and seating comfortable. Service was top notch while we were there and everyone who came by out table was extremely professional. The food itself was also top notch. We had sushi and everything was of the best quality and very well prepared. I liked the selection and found the prices to be representative of the quality as well as area. Yes, it's kind of expensive but what do you expect in Eppendorf and when it's Henssler? All in all, a very good experience and we'll be back. I left out one star simply because this place does lack a bit of soul. It's definitely all good in terms of food, service, location etc. but somehow I didn't get the feeling that this is place which will have lots of regulars and will be used as a ""hang out"" for the inside crowd. Somehow Steffen's place down by the docks has a better vibe to it (be that vibe good or bad). Ono just hasn't come into it's own at this point. Maybe it will and if so, I will update my review. Until then, I am looking forward to grabbing sushi here again soon."
3,"This restaurant was a short walk from our hotel, so we stopped in for dinner.  The place was crowded, but we were seated upstairs right away.  We were also very happy that both the hostess and waiter spoke English exceedingly well.I got the schweinshaxe (roast pork knuckle) and my friend got a fish dish.  The potato dumpling served with the pork was probably the best I'd had in Germany, but the pork at the Schneider (Weisses) Brauhaus was much better.Prices were reasonable, the establishment is roomy, and we sat at a table for two (which is rare in some places).  Overall, a good dining experience."
4,"At first, we just went there for hod dogs. It was sunny outside and we were able to put ourselves in the shade to rest (because they don't have space inside). One hot dog cost only 3€ and they add sauces and toppings such as pickles and fried onions. After that, we also took ice cream which was tasty and refreshing."
3,"Initially we wanted to check out the Hasselwander but saw that it was closed. Maybe they are on holiday? Anyways, still looking for dinner, about a block down, we saw that there was a vietnamese restaurant. We hopped in for dinner during a weekday and the place was not crowded so we were seated immediately. We started with some drinks and fresh spring rolls for our starter. For our entrees, I had the chicken pho and Matt had I think the beef pho.For our starter, the springs were pretty good. They were fresh and it came with the standard dipping sauce of hoi sin sauce with a little bit of sriracha.For my entree, the chicken pho was great. I'm so used to getting a side of jalapenos and drowning this in fish sauce with salt and pepper and eating this along with my pho but I didn't get this here and my german was not good enough to ask for the complicated sides. But my entree was still tasty. They did give me a regular spoon and chopsticks to eat my pho and I would have liked a soup spoon and the hoi sin sauce and sriracha sauce on the table.It's still a solid place to get your pho fix and I'll definitely will be back when I am crazing pho in the neighborhood!"
4,"No doubt, the best burgers in town.After a walk around the Alster lake I decided to have a quick meal.It was about the third time I've been here. For a change I preferred the outside seating. It was a nice day...I asked for the JB Hamburger menu. It was very good, except for the potato chips that where too salty for my taste.I think this restaurant has fair prices.The WC facilities where very clean and the staff where friendly."
1,"It was not tasty.The menu on the card is nice, but the kumpir itself.. is small and less tasty. For this price you could find more tasty potatoes everywhere else.Compared with other Kumpir in Berlin or Istanbul, this is the worst.The salad and sauce was kind of interesting and it looked almost fresh. The shop itself looks clean."
1,"Nice place, simple food but tasty, yummy Hefe but when it came to paying the bill was furious to be charged for it twice- I still need to go back and get my money back!!"
4,"Found this place on yelp and was very excited to get vegan dinner here! The staff was friendly, the food delicious and the atmosphere was very warm and nice! I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend a nice evening and enjoy great vegan or vegetarian dishes."
3,"i went there for the first time on the Tanz in den Mai night!Entrance fee was just 2EURdrinks were rather cheaphowever it was so full with sweaty smelly dancing-elbow-to-elbow drunk people. They played 80s music... although im not a fan of that genre, it was ok. A lot of michael jackson for my taste, but i enjoyed itbut there was no place for us to standhowever turns up there is a second floorwe went up there and it was very pleasant.Different style of music, mostly commercial music and house (not very actual songs, but very danceable) there is also a bar - and a bathroom - in the 2nd floor. If you're ever there, keep in mind: there is a less crowded second floor :)"
3,"In the summer this place seems to be coming into its own. Sitting outside in the square with a huge and excellently made goats cheese salad was extremely enjoyable. It may not be as cool as sitting inside with the trendy design and the big picture windows, but when the sun is out you need to grab it while you can. As well as the excellent salad there seems to be good choice of pasta. I am told the coffee is good as well, but haven't tried it - yet! Highly recommended as a enjoyable but fast lunch spot."
2,"This place was weird. But then againanything is weird after drinking 1.5 bottles of wine before going out with your friends. Was there on a Saturday night and it was completely crowded and kind of sweaty. Someone grabbed my butt a couple of times, one other guy tried to put my coat on his girlfriend he was so wasted and in the backgroundGod awful euro-trance-house-crap that was pretty relentless. This was the upstairs. Moving onto the downstairsta da! We are now in the mid-30's zone complete with German style rap/grind/singalong antics. I don't know about you, but watching Berta and Hans get it on in their tight Euro jeans does something sad to your soul. Oh yes, another Pilsner bitte."
1,"Basic, average food for premium price. I ordered the seafood plate- it turned out to be boiled seafood with a watery sauce and a handful of sliced veggies no side dish, even though it costs 16€. I wouldn't recommend this place."
3,"This is a pretty small restaurant with a bar and is only open for dinner. They serve northern german food and have day tickets posted same day, as well as a traditional menu of the same dishes offered everyday.I ordered labskaus, which is corned beef with two fried eggs, beetroot, herring, and pickles. The dish was pretty simply without complex tastes, although I really enjoyed it (this was my first time having labskaus). My family ordered veal schnitzel (served with yummy sliced potatoes and side salad) which was decent, although nothing to rave about, and pancakes, with gorgonzola cheese and tomatoes, which were thin and crepe-like. My mom was really happy with this meal as she didn't want to eat anything ""german"" or meat heavy.I enjoyed my experience and would come back here to try another simple german meal, although the meal didn't leave me ""wow'd"" and of the nature that this place deserves the extremely high 5/5 rating."
4,Fantastic food at affordable prices in a quick and efficient way. It doesn't get a any better than this for a lunch break.. Oh did I mention there's a great outside area? There is!I had one of the best bolognese pasta dishes here of my life. Yeah. And I didn't had to wait for it I just ordered it quickly and enjoy it. Good selection of local drinks and sodas.Great to eat outside on a sunny and beautiful summer day.
0,So you want wine and tapas? Well forget it - your not welcome there if you have that wish. The owner is surprisingly unfriendly and rude and only wants 'real' dinner guests in his tapas hole.
3,"The Kornhauskeller is a nice, small restaurant with very friendly staff. The lunch menu is rather small, and they offer some German and some Syrian dishes. I had Falafel for lunch, which was truly delicious and cost me only 6,40EUR."
4,"Excellent rib eye steak!!! One of the best steaks I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. Being from Texas, and having grown up on a ranch, eating steaks my whole life, you will not be disappointed here. The service is a little slow, order more beer to take up the extra time!! The cheesecake is excellent, not as good as Don't Tell Mama's, here in Hamburg, but well worth eating. Busy restaurant, never had trouble getting a table. A little better than Estancia Steak House because of price , and the cheesecake."
3,"I like that cafe. They have good food, the service is nice, you can sit outside and the prices are decent. They also have a good breakfast with huge rolls. The last time we came here we had the panino turkey arugula and the chicken with mashed potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and loads of hollandaise sauce. So good!:) Both. Also the neighborhood is great, alternative, cool stores... Love the 'Schanze'."
4,"I purchased number 6 (Conrad's Favorite) and number 7 (Pink Lady), both tasted so wonderful. This is truly cupcakes heaven. The cupcakes was extremely moist and was well presented goes well with coffee or tea. If you know cupcakes then these cupcakes are the perfection of what a good cupcake is. I had a chance to met with the man himself ""King Conrad"" Hahahaha and must I say he is a character himself, fun, spontaneous and down right hilarious. If you love cupcakes you have to visit this little cute cupcakes place if you are ever in Hamburg and if you are not a cupcakes lover you still have to visit just to see the man behind these adorable cupcakes. Conrad will fills your belly with laughter if you are not a cupcakes lover."
4,Very nice place. Friendly people. Brunch has very good choice of different meals.
4,"Very cool little pizzeria just off the Reeperbahn in St. Pauli.  Order at the counter, then find a place to sit.  Don't be surprised if you end up sharing a table - they only have a few large tables and a few chairs at the counter.  Thin crust, good toppings, and a good selection of beers."
3,"We went there with 7 other people, of whose 2 greeks.Very good greek food. Good quality/price ratio :) Service was good and fast.Very noisy though, and the porc is really dry. Get some tzatziki with it :D"
3,"If you are in Hamburg you absolutely must come to eat here, since the food here is the best!The food is so freaking amazing, the prices are great, service awesome and the ambience was perfect.I wish they could deliver to Berlin haha! I crave their bowl of pho all the time."
1,Disappointing burger. The restaurant hat a really good rating but I wouldn't consider like a restaurant. It seems to be more like McDonald's.The burgers are okay but I would not come back here.
1,"If you speak English or not that much German and have any needs that you want to communicate, this might not be the place. The staff did not understand what we asked for when saying ""keine Milch"", which should be pretty self explanatory.. They also forgot to give us our drinks. Food (when we finally managed to make an order) was good, though."
3,"Always busy, always full like most Burger restaurants nowadays. You should always plan with a 15-20min wait. The waitress takes your name and calls you up when a table is free. They are very quick and friendly. The burgers are very yummy and the food arrives fast. The only thing I miss when I eat here is that they don't really have dessert. They also have a small selection of cocktails but I wish they had more or at least that they were a bit bigger for the price..."
4,"Miniatur Wunderland deserves its reputation. They make you travelling through different countries like the US, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria.. The details are fascinating and you won't have the time to get bored. How they conceive the cities is truly impressive and you will be immersed in this miniature world."
3,"Get a hamburger in Hamburg (the origin city of the hamburger). This was a major priority in my plan when visiting this city. After passing by some other Yelp recommendations, I finally decided to take the train out here before checking out the St. Pauli Christmas Market nearby. It's about a 5-7 minute walk from the train stop.Arriving in the evening, the place was packed. As in, every single seat was taken. I tried to seat myself at the bar, only to be informed that I still had to put my name down because there were slots of reservations. No biggie. I was fine waiting. Except it seemed like I waited for half an hour or more as I watched groups of people walk in and get seated without reservations. Turns out the hostess thought I was also waiting for a dining companion to arrive thus the multiple snubs. Well, that tells you something about going out to eat by yourself at restaurants here. Rare stuff.Anyway, I finally got to sit at the bar and already having familiarized myself with the menu--there is an awesome disclaimer on the front page about what to expect with their food and how to eat it--I ordered a burger, fries, and beer. It was a hefty portion and the interestingly English-muffin-like bun was tiny compared to the patty, but a decent American-esque meal. Service was fine. Given the crowds, the popularity of The Bird speaks for itself. It's a good place to eat some good food and for the locals to get a taste of the stateside stuff. Seemed like a very social scene in there. The most important tip I will offer you is this: CASH ONLY."
4,"Excellent Hunan style food with an extra menu in Chinese: some customers were Chinese  always a good sign. I went there with a Chinese colleague and let him order. We had some great ribs, duck, lamb, chicken and also a Sezuan style spicy beef soup/stew which was amazing. Possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had."
4,"An outstanding restaurant! The food was excellent, and the staff's hospitality made for a truly memorable evening. The owner, Franco, clearly loves feeding people and interacting with customers, and the whole restaurant was filled with a great energy. In addition to the great food, the service is what makes this place really shine. I visited this restaurant while traveling alone in Hamburg, and I felt right at home here. I had only the first two courses of the four-course menu (plus dessert and a fancy shot!), and everything was superb - some of the best seafood I've ever eaten! I would have gone for the other courses had I not been so full :) If you are looking for good seafood and a fun, intimate experience in Hamburg, look no further. This place is amazing."
3,"Dean and David is a nice place to have lunch in the city, as it is located close to the main station. I tried the curry, which was very tasty. The staff was very nice and I liked the interior as well. It is simple but very nice.You need to go up some stairs to get to the restaurant."
3,The first time I went to Germany I stumbled on the Schanze by accident. The next time the intent was to hit the Schanze and I ended up at here.  You can start off with drinks upstairs as the bartenders do a great job working their way around the bar.  After drinks and lounging upstairs it's then time to go downstairs after I think 11pm.  Be prepared that it is pretty hot down there if you have on multiple layers as I did.  No matter nothing more drinks can't fix and an escape to the bathroom to peel off a couple of layers.  The music was a great mix of old and new. Great !!
4,"I came here for breakfast and it was very good. I got sunny side up eggs with toast. The egg yolks were way over done, but besides that it was very good (and the chives in the eggs were good - although they are .50 euros more). The fruit in yogurt was okay - nothing special, but the fruit itself was very good and a generous amount. The ginger tea was also interesting."
4,"The best cup of coffee I had in Germany, and possibly ever, came from this lovely little cramped coffee house we spotted on our way back to the train after a full day of exploring Hamburg. We were desperate to acclimate to the time change and coffee sounded like just the ticket, so we stopped in and ordered a highly caffeinated round of deliciousness. I ordered a flat white and a chocolate torte (I actually received a pomegranate cheesecake type treat, which is likely 20% due to the staggeringly loud atmosphere and 80% due to me not speaking a single word of German!), but I still enjoyed it. The coffee was the crowning glory of our stop - rich, strong, perfectly poured and capped with a layer of foam decorated with a pretty little heart. I wanted to try to get back here before heading back to the states, but it was just far enough away from where we were staying that I couldn't swing it. I will dream about that delightful flat white, however, and if I ever return, this will be at the top of my list."
0,"This restaurant has the distinction of having the rudest waiters I've ever encountered in a life of eating and traveling. I lived above this restaurant for six weks and ate there only once, my first night in Hamburg. I went in alone after having slept all day following an exhausting trip. I walked in, slightly disoriented because I expected something different than the nice surroundings. A  waiter with an overly-tailored beard approached me in English and gruffly asked me if I wanted to eat inside or out. I apparently took a few seconds too long to decide and exasperated him. ""Inside or out?"" he demanded. Only because I was famished and still exhausted did I stay. I sat in a secluded corner and was ignored for fifteen minutes, then requested service from another waiter who was busy doing something behind the bar. I wasn't happy, but too tired to leave. No takeout. Great. He then felt it necessary to lecture me that I wasn't in America when I simply offered a curious comparison to the size of the coffee cup presented. He eventually lightened up and complained that I tipped him too much. (I kept getting conflicting information about tipping in Germany). The owner did come over and ask if I liked the meal. It was just okay, but I said it was very good, other customers seemed to be having a good time. This wasn't enough. He looked at me for a moment (the stare) and didn't say anything else, then turned and left. They had an inflated opinion of the restaurant and of themselves, an arrogance similar to what I encountered often in Hamburg, but nowhere else in my travels throughout Germany and Paris this past summer. A sweet young lady smiled and said goodbye as I left, as the first waiter tried to make a point of ignoring me as he dried a plate. I really wished I had had dealings with her instead of these arrogant fools. This experience was so surprising because I had just stayed a week and a half at the Hotel  Kempinsky in Berlin where I experienced, with one exception, nothing but the absolute best service, most professional demeanors, and genuine smiles at all times."
4,"I absolutely love this place. It's like the definition of hipster. It's. So. Trendy. Looks exactly like the stuff my designer ex-flatmate produced. (And he was really talented, so that's a compliment.)And they definitely know their coffee too! There's not only coffee from most parts of the world; once you start talking to the owners (I think?) about coffee, they just go full on passion lecture mode on you. In a good way.If you like coffee, I'd seriously recommend going here with a friend (special or regular kind) and  do a coffee tasting. Owner recommended trying out the same beans as espresso and regular coffee to spot the difference. And then there's of course different kinds of beans with different kinds of roasts.........Sounds like a pretty great pass-time to me.  Well, if you like coffee that is."
4,"Great atmosphere! Food and drinks were very good as well. 4 of us sat in the front bar area. Thumbs up for the shrimp ceaser salad, focaccia bread and potato soup. Food, 2 beers, a Moscow Mule, and wine coat around 60€. A little pricey but nothing we wouldn't pay for the cool, modern atmosphere and quality of food."
1,"Relatively inexpensive Steakhouse like restaurant. Visited for dinner on Wednesday night at about six to 6:30 PM. Place was absolutely dead. This is a large well decorated newer type restaurant. I'd be very surprised if they were able to stay open more than another four months or so. When we left around 8 PM there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant. Seating at the restaurant would be hundred plus. There were two of us for dinner, my wife had a tenderloin steak, which she said was quite tender and fairly tasty. I had a ribeye steak that was extremely tough. The manager came over and inquired about our meals and when I indicated that the steak was tough he did offer to make another steak for me. That was probably the best thing about the meal. The side salad was run-of-the-mill. The baked potato was nothing special. In a city known for its potatoes one would think that the potato would be something extraordinary. Think again. Overall a rather disappointing meal. The server was a very nice Turkish lady, who tried hard to speak English and help us out. Although modestly priced, there are better places to spend your loot."
3,"Came on Phil's recommendation, but they didn't seem to be doing a normal breakfast. There seemed to be only two choices: scrambled eggs or muesli. I went for the scrambled eggs with bacon. It was a nice, if unspectacular, breakfast."
4,"This is a perfect breakfast and lunch restaurant. Or in other words: brunch. :-)You can choose between sweet choices, a fish platter, yummy smoothie bowls or tarts, salads and eggs. Was all delicious and just looked amazing! I mean..this bowl..tasted even better that it looks. A must go on a trip through Hamburg"
3,"Tasty place if you are looking for Vietnamese street food place. Simple but cozy interior. Friendly service, what else do you expect? Prices are very fair and the dishes are full of flavor."
4,"Beautiful old building, interesting guided tour (with appropriate length). A must see when in Hamburg."
4,"This bar is just what the Grindelhof area needed: Hosting a very mixed crowd consisting of mainly students during day-time, at night, the PONY BAR also draws visitors from next door Abaton movie theatre. Honest prices and a good variety of drinks, sweet snacks and music - most of what needs to be said can be found in all the other entries. Here's the clue: Every wednesday night, there's Live-Jazz. Buggy Braune, one of Hamburg's most well known current jazz pianists, hosts a night of Cool and Modern Jazz, Swing, Be- and Hardbop along with his students from the Hamburger Hochschule für Musik und Theater. It's usually a classic jazz trio or quartet. Playing for free, the guys show that it's all about making music. Feel it. If Buggy's off for some other business, some student takes over his Fender Rhodes and puts the keys on fire. Starts at 10:30 p.m. Check ahead for night buses."
4,"This is the equivalent of street food in Hamburg.  In the downtown area there are two right across the street from each other.  No place to sit, just stand and eat your sausages. I had the grilled krakauer sausage not the Curry Wurst.  They were awesome."
3,"One of my favorite restaurants in Hamburg, and especially for fish! Great selection of fish (grilled or with a light sauce) for reasonable prices. Sides are pretty plain, but I've enjoyed the fish whenever I've been there (I haven't tried much else). Nice Spanish/Portuguese flair with cozy deco and atmosphere!! Service is usually a bit slow, but it's a nice place to go out for the evening."
3,"I love a good dive burger place, and this place is really awesome! Came here for dinner and the place was packed, the hostess said that there were no tables available but the bar area was first come first served. There was plenty of room at the bar so it was easy for us to find seats. Immediately we looked at their chalkboard for their angry hour specials. Hehe, not happy but angry hour. There was a special for buy one get one free for the tap beer which we obviously ordered. Then we saw napalm wings for 25 cents each. We love hot wings so we of course did a half order of that. For the burgers, I went with a plain one as the burgers looked pretty massive and there was plenty of mayo and ketchup on the bar top for me to sauce it up if I needed to.For our drinks we ordered a couple rounds of the ratsheern red beer. It's a good light beer and I needed a couple of glasses once the napalm wings came around. When we ordered the napalm wings, our waitress warned us that it was spicy, we said. 'ja, we know'. Then she proceeds, 'No, IT'S REALLY SPICY!"" lol We were foolish and said, 'ja we like spicy!'. The waitress said ok.... and out came the wings! They were in a dry habanero sauce with a side of blue cheese dressing and some carrots. We took one bite and our lips were on fire. ok yeah.... napalm wings are REALLY SPICY! The flavor of the wings were still really good but I think I cried a little! So be careful when ordering the wings. It's a great deal when they are 25 cents but I'm really glad we only had 3 each. I could not finish 6 or a dozen!Ok, as my mouth was on fire, my burger arrived with a heaping pile of fries. I dove into the fries and couldn't really taste anything but burning. After the napalm wings heat subsided, I finally was able to eat my burger which was really juicy and delicious! I love how the english muffin soak up the burger flavor and I was able to eat the whole thing without a fork and knife :) Overall, it's a great place for great messy burgers! The staff is super friendly and were happy to speak to us in english or german. I insisted on german since I'm still learning and the waitstaff was patient with me and my shitty german :)Will be back for the burgers and I still need to try that cheesecake!"
3,"One of my favourite bars in Hamburg. Very friendly and sociable staff, comfortable sofas, relaxed atmosphere and great cocktails at reasonable prices."
4,"Was awesome. Packed, inexpensive, a lot of food had the vegetarian thali. May go back tomorrow for lunch!"
3,"When I thought we wouldn't find good pizza in Hamburg, my hubby found this spot! The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven which you can see from the dining room. The pies are huge! We had trouble finishing the two that we ordered and had to bring them home to have for lunch the next day.I ordered the ham with mushrooms while my hubby ordered the pizza parma. Both were very yummy. The pizza dough was nice and thin and had that bit of chewiness. The toppings were good, though I think they are a bit heavy-handed on the cheese. This place has a great lunch deal, which I probably could not partake in because it would be a trek from where I work, but the regular menu will do just fine."
3,Great place for a Sunday beer. In the summer at least!
0,"Expensive for what it is: our dishes were not well cooked, the quantity served was too little and the recipies were not really ""elaborate"". My advice: do not stop by this restaurant, you'll find many more interesting ones in the same neighbourhood."
1,"Maybe I came to this place with really high hopes because I was really let down with the food. I ordered a burrito with guacamole and asked for it to be inside the burrito and instead I got it on the side which is fine (maybe slight language barrier). When I got my food I was excited to see how massive the burrito was! One thing I notices is that they seem to toast them so it looked more like a Panini than a burrito. Then came the other big mistake, the burrito was extremely soggy! You couldn't pick it up and had to use a knife and a fork. Never have I been served a burrito that needs to be eaten that way. Anyway, it tasted pretty ok but the watery part in the middle kind of ruined the flavors. The guacamole was ok!"
2,"It's expensive for the quality they are offering but I guess you have to pay also for the location. The wine was nice but the food quite tasteless. We just ordered a mozzarella salat for the two of us and well, it was cute and ok but not at al for two persons. It is a fine restaurant if you want mostly enjoy the location."
4,"Been there a couple of times and the staff is super friendly. Don't know if everybody, but they speak Spanish ;D.Sure, this is ""fake Mexican"", but even me as an honorary Mexican--lived there some years--I think it's tasty.Vegetarian options available if you're grossed out about meat for the day.My recommendations: burrito carnitas.And they can save you from starving to death since they close about the latest in the area."
3,"Best Mai Tai in the city & panorama view on Alster lake!! Smoking area is good for talks and no load music, main venue has a long bar with friendly and sexy barkeepers."
2,This place has a nice laid back atmosphere and solid drinks. The food is good and the staff was nice. A nice place to spend the summer-evening with friends.
4,"One of the best steakhouses I've been to  and certainly the best I've been to in Hamburg.I had a Carpaccio with pumpkin pesto, rucola and parmesan as a starter, a 200g (ladies cut) filet as the main course with a side of green beans and bacon. For dessert, a plate of chocolate mousse and brownies, garnished with red fruits.A two-person meal dealt damage of about 150 euros. Considering how much I enjoyed my food, not a large price to pay. Certainly not a cheap restaurant (the starters alone are close to 20 euros a plate, the 200g filet was 35 euros, the dessert 12) but well suited for a once-in-a-while indulgence.Recommended for those who like meat and aren't afraid to get creative with their eating."
1,"Had a quick diner here with some colleagues during a work visit to Hamburg. It was on a Saturday and very early (before 19:00) so not at all busy though several table had already been reserved. I had the veal Wiener schnitzel. As schnitzels go a Wiener Veal is my absolute favourite. I didn't like the one the served me that evening. It was way to thin and very dry. For all I know it could have been last night's left over, that's how bad it tasted. Also didn't like the fact that they charge extra for the Preiselbeeren. If ever I would visit this place again I would not have the Wiener Veal Schnitzel again!"

4,"So good. This is my second trip to Hamburg and my second time here. Came originally because my gf had raved about their lentil soup, and she's right to do so - it's the best. The pide and lahmacun are delicious. And the main dishes are outstanding. Today I had the yogurt kabab and it was great. Chill vibe, friendly staff, good prices, fantastic food."
3,Very good food and friendly service. I've had very good Fish & chips ( crispy and not fat). Not expensive considering the neighbourhood. I recommand it !
4,This restaurant is amazing! The ambience is lovely. The food was so delicious!! We were there on a Saturday evening. I chose the vegi menu and it was simply superb! The cook was so kind.  He guaranteed us a gluten free menu for our little son who is a Celiac(Zöliakie). My son loved the food! He didnt have any stomachache afterwards.  The service was good even though we were in a large group and things got a bit confusing. We will definitely go there again.
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining as Ernst wrote. The food is mediocre at best. There is nothing sensational on the menu. Nor is there anything in any way memorable. All fairly standard fare. Sometimes things are good. Sometimes they are off. The place is not consistent. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow. I couldn't even tell what it was. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table."
1,"Kofookoo is very spacious and nicely decorated. I liked the high ceiling and the interesting light fixtures. The menu is all you can eat or you can order al a carte. Just so we can try more dishes, we went for the all you can eat. We came at lunch on a weekend so it was 15.90 per person--honestly rather steep for the quality of food. I had a hankering for sushi so we ordered most of the sushi, especially those with the raw fish. The only decent thing was the sake (salmon). The octopus and squid were super chewy and had no flavor. The tuna maki was a little concerning because the rice around the fish had turned pink. That shouldn't happen unless the fish was dyed, or something. Also all the maki tasted like they was pre-made and left out for awhile. We tried the warm dishes and the tofu was the most tasty so we ordered a second one, but it was cut too thick so the center was not warm at all. The best part about the food was the black sesame ice cream; we ordered two portions and ate it with the fried kokos creme and fried banana. We got the fruit salad and it was melon that had obviously been cut and sitting there for some time.The staff was nice and friendly and the service was good and quick. However, I wouldn't come back."
4,"YES. YES. YES. This is the best wurst in Hamburg without a doubt. My mother grew up in Hamburg and agrees wholeheartedly, so you know it's good. I worked in the area, which was both a blessing and a curse. You'd think after the 20th time visiting that I would get nauseous at the sight of another Thüringer, Bockwurst or Bratwurst, but the closer I got, the faster my heart would beat, the louder my tummy would rumble, and the more my mouth would water. I was addicted. The currywurst is supposedly their specialty, but I don't like my wurst swimming in sauces. Still worth a try if that's what you're into! Otherwise I'd recommend the Thüringer or Bratwurst with fries!"
4,"The best breakfast in the city. Really advisable. Studentenfrühstück only 5,50EUR. And coffee as much as you want. The atmosphere is really comfi and when the sun is shining you can sit outside and feel the Schanzenvibe. In the peak time it's quite crowded. So get up early enough or reserve a table."
3,"Great food and location, amazing view. Nice bar to continue the evening after dinner."
