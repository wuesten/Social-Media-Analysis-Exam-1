3,"Great source for Hamburg's bestest chips. And I hear their Currywurst is much appreciated by the carnivores, too.I can only rate their Grillgold (chips) which is excellent. Tomato sauce, mayonnaise and vinegar are splashed out for free. Nice! Prices are generally okay seeing that they sell e.g. organic Wurst. :)The grill master can be a little slow indeed but has as yet never been unfriendly.Schmitt's is always a good place of refuge before the drinking starts - or after the drinking has been done.I have heard rumours of people who came in twice on one single night Addictive so! ;)"
3,"The Stadtpark is a great place to relax and lie in the sun, have a walk, go running or make barbecue. There is a special area for the barbecue with containers for the charcoal. Highlights of the Stadtpark are the Planetarium and the pool."
3,"Good burger, nice restaurant, self-service, price low"
4,Strongly recommend this place! Genuine turkish experience and turkish breakfast at its best.
0,"So after five months in Hamburg, I was finally overcome by my desire for a decent burger. Where would I go? I decided to go to The Bird after studying reviews on Tripadvisor and on other fora. In the end it all comes down to the meat, the bun, the cheese, the fries. They're a friendly, well intentioned bunch, but the vast lump of churned meat at the core of The Bird just does come up to standard when it comes to taste or texture. There is no 'bite', it's almost as if the meat has been reduced to the texture and feel of sausage meat. Perhaps they are catering to local tastes. Perhaps there are constrained by local produce. I don't know the reason. I would love to have been able to give them a good review. I would have loved to have had a reliable burger on my new doorstep. But I am afraid that the guys down at The Bird, friendly though they are, just do not know how to make a burger, their core product. Sorry."
4,"Food was great, didn't have to wait for long till the food came, waitress was super friendly! Loved it and highly recommended this Vietnamese restaurant :)"
4,"It's no secret that I'm in love with Lena. However, even if that were not true, I would still give Karlsons five whole Qype stars, as it's truly fantastic. I love the light, airy feel of the place, reminding me somewhat of cafes and bars just north of here, in Copenhagen. Down to business. There's a buffet for sandwiches and salads, but hot food is served at the table. The highlights today were Swedish meatballs, a delicious fish soup, and Danish hot dogs. These dishes proved so popular certain team members even had 2 dinners! (no names mentioned David) Moving on to dessert, and we were delighted to find out Lena had bee up since 4am baking, and the fruits of the oven were indeed mouthwatering - particularly the carrot cake. It's a shame I'm leaving Hamburg today, otherwise I suppose I would have deserted the Milchbar for my new belle Karlsons..."
4,"Just perfect! I could not decide what to eat so I tried everything -aaahhh! Don't regret on single order. All was delish!! Eggs Florentine, vegan pancake, vegan french toast and vegan chocolate cupcake. Best breakfast for dinner I have had in a long while. Kind of glad I don't live here yet. Will definitely come back.You can sit outside or inside. Service is fast and very friendly. They speak German and English. Have great 80s-90s music running in the background. Really in love with the food. Only thing they are missing is glutenfree options. Hope they will add these. I am in love!! Restaurant is close to public transportation, too. You have to come here if you love breakfasts...even for dinner or any time of the day!"
3,This is a fabulous small neighborhood Italian restaurant with all fresh food and a wonderful atmosphere.  On the board as you come in are the local paper accolades so you know that it is extremely popular locally.  We were there on a weeknight and it was crowded although we didn't wait long for a table.  They were wonderful and very helpful even though they didn't speak english very well.  All the locals seemed to know each other and appear to frequent the place a lot.  All were very friendly to us as well.  All together a fabulous experience.  The food and bread was wonderful and the prices were reasonable.
2,"On a 5 minute walk from the central station I found this Thai/Japanese restaurant. Small, but cosy. Restaurant entourage was sparse, not that many oriental stuff on the walls like you see in so many other Asian restaurants. Light is semi bright, you can actually see what your eating... (and who your talking to)The Japanese Asai beer on the menu was not available, had to revert to Kirin (also ok!).Tried Sashimi moriawase (mixed raw fish) for starters and a hot Thai beef curry as main course.It took a considerable amount of time to serve the starting course. The Sashimi was almost worth the wait, very tasty fish indeed. The surimi sticks could have been replaced by some other fresh fish (not so very original..).Only the wasabi was not as spicy and hot as I hoped for.The main course, curry beef, was exactly what I hoped for. Very hot and tasty! Albeit that the beef was a little overcooked and hence not that tender as it could have been. All in all a okay experience, but not so excellent as other reviewers indicated."
3,"After a visit and concert at the Elbphilharmonie we dined with a group in the private dining room. The food and service were excellent. Don't expect cutting edge food, just beautifully cooked and presented classic French cuisine, a salad starter , a slow cooked beef daube with herbed potato mash and a sublime creme caramel. Coffee was a caffeine hit short black. Wines matched well."
2,"Noah's is a nice enough little restaurant on Grosse Neumarkt, but it didn't seem special when I visited last night. When we went inside it was noticeable that we were the only guests there - Admittedly it was a Monday night, but still. The menu is small, which is fine, but the prices are quite a bit higher than the only other greek restaurant that I've been to in Hamburg, and sadly the food is worse On the up-side they're not too far from where I work and they have a competitively priced lunch menu, so I'll probably come back and try that sometime."
4,"Exceptional coffee, cigars, brandy, port, long drinks, short drinks and cocktails. Great for sitting outside and watching tge world walk (and drive) past."
2,"It's big and interesting. That's about it. Oh, there was some kind of food market/festival going on out front of the place. History buffs will probably find this one a gold mine. frankly, I have a hard enough time keeping track of my own history, much less hundreds of years of shipping industry happenings, so I was more impressed by the architecture than anything."
3,"it is not that easy to find a good brunch place in Hamburg! Glueck & Selig is definately worth going! drinks are a little overpriced if you ask me. dishes are nothing fancy, but very tasty!"
4,"Can't recommend this place enough. I lived my whole life in Bavaria but had to move to Hamburg to finally get some real handmade quality Spätzle again! In Augsburg, where I come from, it's gotten pretty hard to get good old fashion Käsespätzle because a lot of places turned into tourist-traps.Zum Spätzle is a very small and cozy place. It was cold outside so the warm and humid atmosphere inside was extra cozy. And with the smell of Käsespätzle in the Air I felt like visiting my grandmas ""gute Stube"". Everything is locally sourced and hand made. Especially the information about the Eggs coming from a farm where the male chicks are not killed was very valuable to me. There are dishes for vegetarians and vegans as well. So chose your Spätzle with Meatloaf or Tofu. I have not tried the Maultaschen, yet. But I sure want to do that someday.Both times I ate there I had a Spätzle dish. First time Käsespätzle with Meatloaf and brown onions was like my dream. Although I prefer my Meatloaf a bit more on the chunky side. This was almost too smooth. But everything tasted flawless, perfect balance of Spätzle and Cheese, the Gravy was to die for. Second time I had Käsespätzle ""pure"". What can I say, I love them. High quality for reasonable prices and you can get a free Spätzle-refill If you're not stuffed yet. Which you will want but can't manage to eat.Service is nice and chilled and asks for dessert & coffee in the best way without being pushy. Which is a quality I like very much. Lastly the place is so cosy with lots of pillows, natural wood, warm light and the smell of my childhood. At my grandmas or at a small cottage-restaurant were my parents used to take us to eat after we went hiking at the Alps. I recommend making a reservation if you want to eat there in the evening. I got lucky both of the times I went there. But I will visit again and again and I can not recommend enough to go and try it. Even If you are a tourist from Bavaria! Go and get some good Spätzle again!"
1,Bad service even for Germany. Not the best food either. If you want beer and to be ignored go here. If you are actually hungry.... good luck. The sampler platter is not very appealing. Just skip to the entrees and save your self the money.
4,"This bar is just what the Grindelhof area needed: Hosting a very mixed crowd consisting of mainly students during day-time, at night, the PONY BAR also draws visitors from next door Abaton movie theatre. Honest prices and a good variety of drinks, sweet snacks and music - most of what needs to be said can be found in all the other entries. Here's the clue: Every wednesday night, there's Live-Jazz. Buggy Braune, one of Hamburg's most well known current jazz pianists, hosts a night of Cool and Modern Jazz, Swing, Be- and Hardbop along with his students from the Hamburger Hochschule für Musik und Theater. It's usually a classic jazz trio or quartet. Playing for free, the guys show that it's all about making music. Feel it. If Buggy's off for some other business, some student takes over his Fender Rhodes and puts the keys on fire. Starts at 10:30 p.m. Check ahead for night buses."
0,"My partner and I thought the place was lovely - very minimalistic and tasteful. I loved the gorgeous wooden tables and floor. The service was awful though. I guess I'm the first to say it about Erste Liebe: but the waitress we had was really rude. I've never had the inclination to write and complain after receiving bad service but the waitress we had was incredibly unpleasant. She was rude from the minute she came to us. At the end of our visit, she snatched the money off of my partner's hands and stomped off without a word. It ruined the place for us, really. Unfortunate - because we enjoyed everything else about this place."
4,"Probably one of the most unique things you'll see in your life. Worth seeing! The airport section is just incredible! Perfect for anyone: family, couple, friends."
4,"I've been here quite a few times and never left disappointed. The place is and the music is always quite nice and chilled out, and Croques are delicious. I'll come back and I can definitely recommend it."
4,"Great place for walking around and admiring the old architecture integrated with the modern updates. Millions have been spent to turn the Hafen City into a luxury living and tourist area. So far, so good. Downsides are: heavy wind and not enough trees to keep those huge spiders in check!"
4,"We went to Meine Kleinraumdisko the other day after a hard night's drinking gluhwein at the DOM. A few friends were over from the UK, and one had brought a bottle of ""Pendle Witch's Brew"" as a present (see photos). Unfortunately being completely drunken the beer was lost during the course of the night... that was 5 days ago. On the off-chance that it was still there and had been saved from consumption, we turned up there last night. Amazingly they had found it and kept it! (see photos) The place itself is a cool little bar that I always think of as being on feldstrasse, but is actually on the bit that is called Neuer Kamp. Very confusing. The decor is 70s-styled wallpaper and disco lights. The music is chilled and there are loads of sofas to lounge about on. As far as I'm concerned the beer is Augustina."
3,"Suntan o'clock! It really is kind of like being on a real beach, except you've just walked from your house and you can't actually jump in the Elbe, just see it. A relaxed vibe, decent seating/cushions if you get in early, and a nice bar that will even serve Weissbier with a straw - totally tropical. My only gripe would be the amount of cigarette butts in the sand. So no 5th star. Still - something very different and cool to show off to your English friends!"
4,"Ich liebe den Elbstrand, schon im Sommer grillen oder picknicken ist schon was schönes. Aber nicht nur im Sommer kann man am Strand spazieren gehen, im Herbst ist es auch ganz schön mit Schatz, ner Decke und nem heißen Kakoa =)"
2,"Depending upon when you go, Mutter varies a lot. On the weekend it'll be so rammed that you can hardly get through the door and it'll be smokey as hell - the smoking ban does not apply here. However, when it's not so busy it's alright in here. It's never going to be my favourite bar, but I had a nice enough time here."
4,This place is just beautiful. It's my favourite city escape. Perfect for walking your dog & Sports! I highly recommend this park! Go there & explore!
4,This is definetely my favorite place for coffee. It's tiny so sometimes I have to do take away but coffee is first class. Usually when I drink coffee I have this funny problem after where I feel quite tired after few hours. With Peaberries coffee I never felt anything like that. My wife told me this has to something with a way how coffee is roasted.
1,"After experiencing the Amsterdam Dungeon, which assumed everyone attending the attraction at least spoke English, I was excited to visit the Hamburg Dungeon.  What a disappointment.Out of our party, only my Dutch husband understood German, and only at a basic level.  Since I speak Dutch myself, I got the gist of what was going on but my American parents and best friend were left in the dark save for 3 videos that had English subtitles.  We made it known our party was english speakers, but this didn't make much difference.To give the actors credit, some of them did attempt to make the scenes understood.  I was chosen to answer to crimes as a sinner in one scene and the actor easily switched to english.  However, the overall experience as a non-german speaking tourist was disappointing."
4,"Decided to come here for Sunday brunch while visiting Hamburg based on other reviews. It didn't disappoint! The breakfast offerings are outside of your traditional German (of course) but are superior in my opinion. Large portions, plenty of flavor, lots of choices. We were able to get seating immediately (lucky) around 1100. The service was relatively quick and the staff was very friendly. Prices were extremely reasonable and the two of us ate for under 20€. There was a mix of clientele; this restaurant is not just for Turkish or Arabic people. I recommend picking up a variety of the baklava and other sweets on your way out as well. I will be back if I'm ever in the area again!"
1,"A big Bavarian style bar with litre masses of beer, staff in Bavarian costume. the food is quite good and the place is fun with a group of people. The staff could be more friendly."
4,"A good little restaurant where you can either take away or consume inside. I am used to come the morning for their croissants or at lunch for their Schönes Grün salad which is based on quinoa, suave raspberry, beans, avocado and other green vegetables. The staff is very kind and fast, I recommend it very much!"
2,"We ate at Kartoffelkeller on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The restaurant is on a very picturesque street in Hamburg, right on the water. The concept of a potato themed restaurant intrigued us so we decided to give it a shot. There weren't many other patrons in the restaurant since we were late for lunch so we were seated right away.  The decor seemed a bit dated and it seems like a place that gets a lot of business from tourists--which isn't a bad thing but you could tell the place needed a little ""freshening-up.""I had the Hamburger Pannfisch and the husband had potato pancakes and the potato soup with sausage. Both of our meals weren't particularly spectacular but they weren't horrible either. We came away satisfied so we consider that a win. Portions were large but we didn't think that the food quality justified the price."
3,"Being relatively new in Hamburg (living here since about eight months), my girldfriend and me went there last Sunday for the first time. At the door my girlfriend had to show the contents of her bag because they wanted to make sure we don't bring any bottles with us. I don't think this is necessary, but hey, it's their club and we had to play by their rules.We were quite lucky finding two seats on a Sunday afternoon and had a fantastic look on the river. I ordered two Astra Alsterwasser at the bar (self-service only) and paid 2,70 EUR each. This definitively is too expensive for this local drink and was the reason we didn't stay for another drink.However, the decoration at this beach club is indeed very stylish (the car grill as a bbq grill is awesome! :) ) and I would suggest to go there at least once to see it."
2,"Amusing evening in this cavernous new St Pauli Sushi place.The deal is, you pay a fixed price and can stay for two and half hours, order 10 items every 20 minutes, so there are a few limitations. We were told that it is very rare for anyone to order the full amount, potentially 200 items! But it has been known to happen.Each table is equipped with a red ipad, you order and the dishes start arriving thick and fast, 10 at a time. First we went for salads, all very fresh and delicious, particularly the seaweed salad, and I made a mental note to have more. Twenty minutes later, we ordered the next round, this time warm dishes, all very good and very fresh as you would expect from a place with this rapid a turn around. Highlights were grilled fish.Next round, more or the same, some of the grilled items were delectable, yet came in small portions.Still going strong, we started on the sushi, here there was a slight difference in quality between the hand rolls and the smaller sushi, which I suspect were machine made, so we opted to continue with the fresher hand rolls.This continued until the fifth round when our appetites began to flag, but hey, you do the maths 5 rounds equals 50 items per table of two. No small achievement!Drinks were slightly expensive, but they had some excellent beer on tap.With an offer from Groupon, the total cost of this feast was just over Eu 30, not bad I would say.Service was friendly, efficient and informal.Bottom line, this is not really a sushi restaurant, more of a Pan-Asian, fun house! Don't go there expecting Sushi artistry, you won't find it. What you'll find is a lively venue for a fun evening! Great for a small group, I'd say.I'd go again, but only with an offer!"
3,"I became a fan of Thai food last year on a stay in the US...since then I really love Thai food and - of course - this was the reason to look out for Thai restaurants while on a short trip to Hamburg.I found Sala Thai Hafencity while walking around this beautiful part of the city - and went in for lunch. First: The place looks super. Very clean, nicely decorated and a fantastic view! The food I had was very good - a soup and hot chili beef. The slightly sour soup was very different from many other soups I had in Thai places...And the beef was very delicious though VERY hot. I am really accustomed to eating hotter than most other people...but that was almost too hot. So watch out when the menu says ""hot""! Service was great. Never disturbing, always nice...just like it's supposed to be. And the price was absolutely fine for what I got (might be different in the evening, though). To sum up: When I'm in Hamburg again I will visit Sala Thai again. This is a place I can recommend without hesitating."
4,Absolutely awesome!  We'll worth a reason to visit Hamburg alone!  We took backstage tour offered for some extra euros. We were lucky to have taken the tour since we were only two. Great insight of the technology used.
3,"Great spot to hang out, just off The Reeperbahn and away from the craziness. They play great music, the bartenders are fantastic and the crowd are a good bunch. Since it is just off The Reeperbahn, it is GREAT people watching.....just park yourself by one of the windows, grab a drink and peer out at the mix of locals, tourists, hookers and the rest of the lot. You can easily waste away hours drinking and dancing (if there's room). I HIGHLY recommend when you inevitably find your way to this delightfully seedy part of town."
4,"The service is pretty slow (they are very understaffed), but the food is great. The scallop satay was really delicious. The chilli club salad was alright. The dressing was pretty fatty and the duck was fried. The chicken satay was pretty good, but also seemed a little unhealthy. The california rolls were very good. The red chicken curry wasn't so great. The sweet coconut curry with chicken was excellent and the chicken in it tasted fantastic with just salt and pepper.Even though the service was a little slow, our waitress was extremely friendly. I'd definitely recommend going here."
2,"We wanted to try out the restaurant because the reviews were quiet good. The first impression was good. The atmosphere is good. You can sit outside if you reserve a table in advance.We ordered a starter. A mixed starter plate cost 18€. Even though it is overpriced, it was delicious. For bread you pay an additional 4€. As a main starter we ordered homemade pasta with truffle (28€) and Pasta Aglio with scampis (18€). The homemade pasta with truffle was delicious. But still very overpriced. Pasta Aglio was really disappointing. Tiny four scrimps were added. Winterhude is known for the higher prices. We were very disappointed. I am willing to pay more if the quality and the service is good. This was not the case. We waited 1.5h for the main course. Service was not asking whether we want more drinks or have any other wishes. All in all this place is a overpriced. The service is not great. You need to wait a long time to be served. The dishes are not outstanding."
2,"Essen und Wein super - Service fällt dagegen stark ab. Wen's nicht stört ist hier super aufgehoben, um ehrlich italienisch zu essen."
4,"Love the concept: Choose either the predefined salads, or make your own combination.All the ingredients were so fresh, and it was a huge bowl of salad - I couldn't even finish it.Please note that theres a serious rush hour around lunch, place is probably best avoided at this time. Then again - we came during lunch and still found a place to sit. People dont sit too long, so tables free up all the time.Aaaand - theres free wifi. Bonus when you are tourist!"
4,Awesome! Wonderful food and Benny was a great server to us. So hospitable and down to earth Would come back here often.
4,"The food is so good , so tasty. Location is not so far from center , you can take bus or train to get there. Services are friendly , they gave you recommendations when you didnt know what to choose. Must-have-to-go restaurent when you are in Hamburg."
4,"So good food and such a good service ! It is a little bit more expensive than other restaurants in Hamburg but so worth it. You get what you pay for! You can choose from different side dishes, sauces and herb butters and combine your own meal. The waiter we had was very nice! He filled up our glasses in time and even tho the restaurant was packed with people we didn't have to wait for a long time for the food. The tartare starers is to die for!"
3,"I highly recommend this place, it's a lot cooler and more local than all the touristy spots on the reeperbahn, and it's a bit of an older and more hip crowd (mostly people 30s and above, but I'm not even 20 and didn't feel weird at all). We were the only non-Germans it seemed like. It took us a while to get our cocktails, and they weren't exactly cheep, but it was well worth it because they were AMZING. Best cocktails I've ever had, and shots are pretty well priced! The interior of the bar is super funky, the bartenders are fun, beautiful, and amazing, and all the people here were so friendly. All in all this place has a great vibe and we had a really fun Saturday night!"
2,"Stopped here after dinner a couple of time, completely full on Fridays and Saturdays. loud music and place for smokers. it is a nice place to hang out in this neighborhood in summer with outdoor seating."
3,"went with a Groupon Gutschein, great food and live pan on the table!!"
4,"A great new Irish pub in Deichstrasse. A great selection of beer and whiskey as the name would suggest. Live music, karaoke and live sports on tv add to the atmosphere. Definitely a great place to meet up and only a short walk from Rodingsmarkt U-Bahn station. Richard and the team give you a warm welcome and I look forward to going back many times."
1,"I really wanted to love this place simply because it's vegan and even brought (4!) non-veg friends to try it out but it was disappointing. They were out of almost everything so we went with mediocre veggie patties on dry buns and ok sauce with no table service and overpriced (tiny!) bottles of fritz colas. There are definitely better vegan/veggie burgers to be had in Hamburg, even just a couple blocks away."
3,"The place is small and luckily we had a reservation, because it was very full (friday evening). In the end they even sent people away because there was no more food. However, the burgers were big and delicious. I had a vegan Burger with sweetpotatoe fries, both very good. We didn't have to wait long for the food and even though there was a lot going on, the waitress was really kind and not stressed. We felt very comfortable. Last but not least, prices are absolute appropriate!"
1,"I came here a few weeks ago on a Friday around 7PM with my wife. We found a seat outside and waited 30 minutes to order, then another 40 minutes for our food arrive. The burger was pretty good and really tasty, but it's such a disappointment after waiting for so long. They definitely need more servers and more organization around how you order.We've been to their old location and really anticipated something better here, but it seems like they are still working out the problems in their new location. I'll give them another try in the future, but be wary if you show up hungry."
3,"One of those cafe's that you don't find that often. Small, nice and calm feeling. Almost as stepping in to a livingroom. The coffe is great."
2,"We went to Le Xich Lo for a late Friday lunch.. I had high hopes for this place because I enjoy food from the region and always prefer authentic restaurants.The waitress was not at all friendly. It was quite obvious that she'd rather have a short of break at this time than serve us. I even had to reason with her why I would like to have some more chili sauce.The food wasn't really a highlight either. The soup was luke warm at best and tested boring. For a national dish I'd expected a bit more. As a starter I tried frog legs which weren't impressive either. They were totally over-seasoned and chewy. The 3 stars are for the Mango Curry my wife had, that was actually very tasty. The only plus for this place."
2,Good to go with a friend. The cheapest Hendricks gin and Tonic I have found in Hamburg major plus! Shabby chic all the way and a really varied mix of clients.
4,"thank you, international Yelpers... this place is so 5-star i desperately wish it was in my 'hood back in L.A. CA USA.  it's everything one would want in a neighbourhood spot:  -so friendly...the first time we were there, one of the workers asked if we were new to the area, and when he found out we were just tourists from America, he really went out of his way to answer all our questions about Hamburg. -so cozy. there are two rooms, both with comfy couches, and tables and chairs.  there's a big covered patio out front, with a dog bowl for thirsty pups.  there's even a basket of books for kids! -so delicious.  they've got great chai lattes and good coffee.  the pastries are fresh and there's a good selection of German classics.  they make a nice quiche plate that comes with salad too.  everything's plated really nicely.we came here as much a possible during our stay and really loved our relaxed afternoons there, people-watching while sipping a delicious drink with yummy eats. it's really the perfect incarnation of a local cafe/coffee spot."
4,Very fresh and tasty hotpot. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and the service is really paying attention to the guests.funny they are twins as waiters so you always think one is next to you. The vegetables and the fish and meet is from good quality and enough to eat - even for my big hunger. The price is not that cheap but still worth for the good service and food quality and interior.We'll come again. :)
4,Nice spot on the Alster! Was here to enjoy the sun and this location is fantastic... It is without service but associates are friendly and they as well offer food (BBQ) when the weather is good. The prices are fair and you can rent boats etc if you are up for it.
4,I love self-service Bok - I prefer the no messing around feeling. I prefer the way the food is presented. I prefer looking at a few boards rather than that ridiculous 500 page book of a menu - it's so much easier to find something you want to eat. I also prefer the Wagamama-esque benches and communal tables - it lends itself to a much friendlier atmosphere. There's also no getting annoyed that you can't get the over-worked waiter's attention. The only real negative with this place is that it's situated underneath a Burger King. Oh well.
2,"It's right around the corner from where i live.It's a cozy small place. I've been there only a couple of times, but i walk past it very often.Not much is happening in there, its barely ever full, usually has 2 or 3 guests.However the food tastes ok.I've had the Naschmarkt Salat for 8,50 EURIt has avocado and turkey. It's really really good. Its not the place to be, but if you are bored from the same restaurants, why not try Jolie for a change!"
4,"The best cup of coffee I had in Germany, and possibly ever, came from this lovely little cramped coffee house we spotted on our way back to the train after a full day of exploring Hamburg. We were desperate to acclimate to the time change and coffee sounded like just the ticket, so we stopped in and ordered a highly caffeinated round of deliciousness. I ordered a flat white and a chocolate torte (I actually received a pomegranate cheesecake type treat, which is likely 20% due to the staggeringly loud atmosphere and 80% due to me not speaking a single word of German!), but I still enjoyed it. The coffee was the crowning glory of our stop - rich, strong, perfectly poured and capped with a layer of foam decorated with a pretty little heart. I wanted to try to get back here before heading back to the states, but it was just far enough away from where we were staying that I couldn't swing it. I will dream about that delightful flat white, however, and if I ever return, this will be at the top of my list."
4,Service was amazing! Atmosphere was also great. I got bacon cheeseburger on a dark bun and sweet potato fries. The texture and flavors were well balanced and very satisfying. The food was also presented beautifully. I plan on returning soon!
4,"Woohoo!!! Simply amazing...I decided to enjoy my dinner here with my parents, we had an amazing food experience!Everything is perfect! You start with a shrimps flambè, then two courses of fish/meat and dessert. Everything is so well presented and the cozy atmosphere let you enjoy a really good dinner!Reservation is suggested since the restaurant is quite small inside."
3,"I went here for lunch with a coworker today and quite enjoyed it. Quick advice: try to come at an off-time! This restaurant is tiny, tiny, tiny--maybe only 3-4 small tables. We ate relatively late at 1 p.m., and we still had people eagerly waiting for our table.We both ordered the same thing--the grilled fish plate and a cherry soda. I don't know if anyone speaks English here because we ordered in German, but it would have been easy enough to just point at the menu if you can't speak any. We had our food in about 10 minutes  or so. The grill-plates were amply filled with a few different types of fish and a tasty salad. There was quite a bit of tartar sauce on the side, but I didn't use most of it because the fish was that good.Also, even though the restaurant is quite small, or maybe exactly because it is so small, I liked the ambience of this place. The stools were all well-worn, the tables tiny, and the street outside old and cobbled. Many of the restaurants in the neighborhood are soulless cafes and kiosks, so enjoy something a bit nicer here--though still not too expensive."
4,"to echo another reviewer: hands down the best falafel in hamburg.it's also, miraculously, the cheapest: €2,50 for a basic wrap, €,50 for each additional ingredient, meaning you can get an enormous, overstuffed, insanely delicious falafel for the same price as a shitty, flavorless one at every other shop. i know which one i'd choose!"
3,"Die Pizzeria is a family favorite for us, partially because it's so close to home, but also because their food is really quite good, the ambience is casual but nice, and the staff is really friendly.The pizzas are an extremely thin crust, cooked perfectly. Because the crust is so thin, the margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella) is probably my favorite. They have chili oil available, which I usually put on to give it a little kick. I've tried a bunch of the other pizzas, too, and they're good, too. They also have a handful of pasta options, which I've tried a few times. By far my favorite pasta is the linguine aglio, olio, e scampi (garlic, oil, and shrimp), which comes with a heap of arugula on top, and just a really great flavor overall. There are soft drinks, wines by the glass and bottle, and beer on tap. A few of their wines by the glass are excellent, and reasonably priced. I always get the feeling that I'm being slightly overcharged at Die Pizzeria, but I think that's just the Eppendorf surcharge (everything is probably 20% more expensive than it should be). When it's warm enough (or when the locals decide it's warm enough, they also have seating outdoors. They'll even set up a TV for big sporting events (World Cup, etc)."
4,"This restaurant is a true gem! It's been in business and family run since the 1970s, so expect some brilliant traditional Italian cooking. I try to go every time I'm in Hamburg."
4,"Almost got a point off for the rather long wait for a table, but otherwise a delectable start to the day. Three eggs benedict with a side of Hash Brown each, (looked and tasted a whole lot like country style potatoes to me but hey, maybe thats how they do it in Canada), and three pancakes with maple syrup were as good as inhaled by myself and two starving Bavarian brothers. Top it all off as I did with a hibiscus tea and a coffee and you'll need to be rolled out of the restaurant, like I was. (Almost.) Worth the weight."
4,"This place is a winner! And who would have known? It's hidden behind Osterstrasse, not far from U-Bahn, impossible to spot.Come and try if you like- wine- modern ambiance- yummy snacks- relaxing summer terrace - good serviceAbout wines: open wine selection is not that extensive, but you can buy any bottle (and they have a great choice), have it served at you table in restaurant with additional 7 eur and bottle of water for free. Not cheap but worth visiting at least once. My five stars."
4,"The original Mo Griller and the Currywurst is the bizzomb!!  I went here four times during my one week in Hamburg.  It would have been five but I missed them by 2 minutes on my last day, so sad, haha."
4,"I think this is my favourite park in Hamburg. It's huge, I've probably seen only 10% of it but it's the perfect place to be on a sunny day. It's never too crowded, not sure because of its size or because people prefer going to Elbstrand. In my opinion this is definitely a plus, since one can really do what he wishes, chill, read a book, play football, Frisbee, grill etc. without being hassled by the people around. There are even a couple of museums in the middle of it. I don't want to spoil this place too much, come and check it out in person. In my opinion this is a MUST see during summer time if you live in Hamburg."
4,Such an interesting part of Hamburg... A place where old meets new to the max. Even though it reminds me of Holland and Amsterdam a lot it has it own charm due to the new part Hafencity being add to the old Speicherstadt... Cannot wait for the Elbphilharmonie to be finished and see this area grow to a fun and interesting place. It could use some green and trees though... That is a pity... a leafy lane would work well here as contrast to both the new and the old!!!
3,"Nice little park between Hoheluft-Ost and Harvesthude. There's lots of space to picnic here on a sunny afternoon, benches to lay on and enjoy the sun and plenty of room to play ball and barbeque. The park itself is circular, so taking walks around the park lead you straight where you started off :)"
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this place considering how long I've regularly been coming here. This is my favorite breakfast place in Hamburg. My favorite seats are in back, upstairs. This place has been a staple for me almost 10 years now. Used always come here when visiting Hamburg and before moving here. Awesome breakfasts, super nice staff, easy location, and great atmosphere. I've only been here for breakfast and can't say much about the rest of the day, but I have yet to be disappointed here."
3,As a british man Indian curries are extremely important to us as they are our nation's favourite.  The service was polite and authentic as was the choice of two Indian beers. My wife chose a wine and it was very nice which is rare in a curry house and we shared the 2 person tandoori platter. It was a lot of food but very very nice.
4,"One of the best experiences I have had at a restaurant - Franco the owner is amazing. The venue is small and intimate, but is filled with energy, fantastic service and the food is worth the wait. Franco took his time to really interact with his customers and that involvement makes the food and experience intoxicating."
3,Öld style Environment with well built antique! Little bit expensive but quality ! Bre
4,"This was my go-to coffee spot in Hamburg. Missing it to this day.Great location, really nice staff and the coffee is just amazing. I still dream of the perfect double-shot Americanos I got from here.This plus a few other places alone would make Hamburg worth a trip."
3,"The last weekend me and a friend of mine were looking for nice icecream. So we decided to go to Eiszeit.Obviously the shop was full of hungry people who were waiting in a long row (50feet).After 10min of waiting, we had the choice of many interesting varieties like ""the ball"" ,which is the icecream of Rocher. yummie! The price per scoop is not that cheap (about 90 cents), but its worth it !"
3,"I went there for lunch and ate one of the day's specials - a plate with rice, salad and turkey meat with vegetables. The food was tasty, cooked just right and the portion was exactly big enough. The line can get huge during lunch, however, so don't plan on a quick 5 minute trip here if you're going for lunch during the week."
4,"So you're looking for something to do in Hamburg aren't we all. If you're a car enthusiast this is a must see. At the time of my visit they had a collection of Porsche, Formula 1, and a couple super cars. Very thorough and detailed exhibits offering the back story to each car and in many cases a short video. Takes lots of photos, plenty of desktop art found here. Excellent for English visitors, and German natives. Entrance is 10 euros, they accept credit cards."
4,"Since I moved to Hamburg, I have been searching for the best dim sum place for my weekend ""brunch"", of which I have been doing for years back in my home country. and yes, I am Chinese. I have tried several restaurants, Mei Moon is the real authentic Cantonese one. The owner and chefs are Cantonese, and they have the best taste bud within the whole China. Each dim sum is handmade in house, instead of mass production frozen pieces, which u can buy in chinese supermarket. Highly recommended for people who crave for a good Cantonese yamcha. Thumbs up for the food. However interior and ambient is better at dim sum haus around the corner."
3,I really liked the cherry chocolate gelato.
3,"I happened across this place the other night after coming out of a flat viewing. I have to say the outside looks a bit circumspect, but I noticed that every table outside was taken, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. We sat by a window table inside instead, which was actually as good as being outside but not as cold, and had the filet steak, and a (forgive my spelling) schnitzel. The food wasn't bad at all, the service was great, and the beer was nice too. So all in all, it's not bad! (forgot to mention - apparently they have DJs on here too - but don't know what they're like!)"
0,Great wings. But worst service ever!!! Takes ages to get your food if and just if they do't forget it!
4,Authentic Indian food! Especially the naan! The portion size was also perfect. Only thing that was a bit irritating was the limited sitting space.
3,Tischreservierung total versemmelt :-/ aber sonst wie immer sehr gut.!!!
4,"Delicious! Great environment, friendly staff, and delicious ice cream- all for a great price!!! They also have vegan options. Would highly recommend!"
2,"From the very beginning, they had us standing out in the cold so they could try to sell pictures of us with axes. Considering the price we shoulda gotten the picture for free... lol It's a lot of acting and narrating in German, so if you don't speak german, a lot goes over your head. But some of the videos have english on the bottom however bring your reading glasses cuz its a bit small. overall i think they should consider english tours considering they have parts of their brochure in english... a lil misleading. so 3 stars only."
3,"I got some takeaway grilled meats here with my Cypriot flat mate on a lazy Saturday evening. What can I say: it was delicious! The service was friendly, and the portions plenty. The meat was perfectly grilled (not dry at all), and the tzatiki fresh. Only downside: the chips were not great (but then again--my Belgian nationality requires me to be this picky when it comes to those golden sticks of deliciousness). I had to take my Greek-speaking companion's word on the authenticity, but it definitely tasted that way. Great place for a cheap pig-out meal, but if you want more refined Greek food, there are other places."
1,"After trying this place twice I can't honestly say I would go back. The food was ok, not great, but ok. It seems that kidney beans are quite expensive as I never seemed to get very many in my burritoWhat was bad is the waiting. It has both times taken a little longer than 1hour. The argument is that it takes 45 to bake them. There are faster ways that are equally good, if not better. Only go there if you don't have any appointments afterwards"
4,"I went here for lunch and had the roast beef, with fried potatoes and salad (it cost 10.80€). We got to Hej Papa at around 12:30 and got the last table. If you are a large company it might make sense to reserve a table or come early. Anyways, might have been the best roast beef I have had here in Hamburg, so really good! The pasta dishes and salads looked really good too, so there's plenty to choose from."
4,"Went there for the first time last night and was very satisfied with this cute restaurant! The atmosphere, food, beer, and service were all great and there's really nothing to complain it! My partner had the schnitzel and I tried the vegetarian Spätzle. Both were really tasty and my partner is still talking about how much he enjoyed his meal. Also, the little salad which comes with the meals were really good! Normally, in German restaurants the little side salads are nothing to write home about, but this one was an exception and very good :) What a great find! Would definitely return."
3,"the burgers and fries were yummy but couldn't finish them all since the quantity was huge! burger without the bun should be the best as they come with salad and could be a healthier option! the chicken cheese burger was tasty but as time went, their special mayo was getting saltier - the sad part. but overall was a good lunch as the first meal in Hamburg and for a good price :)"
2,"This coffee shop has been hyped as one of the best places in Hamburg for a coffee. For me personally, to test the coffee quality in an outlet specializing in coffee the gold standard is to order an Espresso. What shall I say? Their Espresso is a far cry from a decent Espresso... it looks like a bland blackish puddle produced by a fully automated machine and tastes also like it. No crema, very watery. The only plus is a very fruity and light taste to the coffee, reminding me of a spring flower bouquet. So, coffee quality fairly ok, preparation a no-go. Service is definitely not this spot's strength with both counter attendants minding their own business with an air of utter indifference toward the customer. Maybe this experience is a one-off and I would see a very different atmosphere some other time around. Yet, there won't be another time."
3,"Trendy, cozy, chilled. Several standard drinks served on a high quality level make your night at this place. Enjoy yourself and your crew in between well off people of any age. The music is easy to listen and even if the place is crowded it is quite easy to keep talking and even more important listening ;-) The bartenders are really pros and they give you the drinks in a good mood and in a very reasonable time. You are looking for a place for a easy evening? Then this is the place you should truly consider.One star is missing because service time is reasonable, not best effort at any time."
3,"Three things here are unquestionably cool. The name: A day bar, which is called ""first love"", cannot be completely bad. Then the free view through the enormous windowpanes. And (last but not least) the WLAN (uncool: it's npt free). What else? The usual menu card with pasta & snacks as well as the obligatory selection on coffee from latte to espresso and various cakes (home-made?). A popular meeting place also in the summer, where one can sit outside at beer garden tables. Also a good after worx hangout. The beautiful large heavy sturdy wood tables are used often also for project meetings. Meals, drinks, work, chat, hanging out in an area with bar. It's nice to be here."
4,"Was awesome. Packed, inexpensive, a lot of food had the vegetarian thali. May go back tomorrow for lunch!"
3,"Fabulous restaurant. Went here for dinner with my husband and we were completely impressed by the service and food. I was very afraid given that we are American and didn't know if we would be treated well at an upscale German restaurant but they were very hospitable. The regular stares and gawks per usual but nonetheless good service. Note: You HAVE to make a reservation. They do not close at 12, they close well before then so you need to be prompt and also have a reservation."
4,"Ok, this is official. Milch is my favorite coffee place in Hamburg now. Flat white is amazing good."
4,"Very new, and very modern steakhouse located very close to the central train station.The menu is excellent and the staff tried their best to keep up with my rusty German; and helped by attempting some English which is always appreciated. The menu was good, with an excellent range of steaks and meat; all served with garlic bread, salad, fries or a potato - they even have a kids menu if thats your thing.They also had a good range of desserts should you have space left after your main.Steak was well cooked, excellently seasoned and delicious. My ice cream was good, although it did melt fairly quickly due to the restaurant being a little too warm.Service was laid back, fairly slow making for a leisurely dinner where you could enjoy your food.Prices were reasonable and my main + drink + dessert came to roughly €25 with tip included so better value than other steakhouses nearby.I recommend checking this place out if you want a good steak for a good price and with excellent service."
3,An unusual style with a surprise menu. Just tell them what you really cannot eat and they will create something for you. quite a small place so booking is adviseable and at weekends absolutely necessary - its even possible to have a 2 or 3 week waiting list for a weekend booking.
4,"I felt like I'm sitting in somewhere seattle where slow hip hop music surrounding with a smoke salmon omelette. Feel home, in the middle of our journey."
3,"Had a great dinner here last night. I'm going to go ahead and give them 4 stars even though I do have two things to quib about. Were these resolved they easily get 5 stars. One is the fact that they have a ventilation system which is necessary to keep the place from stinking like the kitchen. At the same time, this creates a draft on half the seats which really isn't something you want. We had to change seats in the hope of not waking up the next day with sore necks. Luckily we received a table upstairs and had the whole level to ourselves which was very much to our liking. Second complaint is the wine pricing. By the glass, you only get 0,1 servings at prices which are usually for 0,2 size servings. Not a major big deal but still kind of high for the rest of the menu's very positive notes. There is also a 0,25 size serving but for two people this is also poor sizing. Anyway, these were very minor complaints on my end. On a very positive note service here is great. Super nice waitress who was more than attentive the whole evening and very helpful in making choices off the menu. We both had the pasta with truffles which was really good. Further, and I usually wouldn't comment on this, the bread served was amazing. Super tasty and warm which when eaten with the high quality olive oil rounded out our meal nicely. We also had dessert and were very impressed. We ordered the pistachio tarte and the chocolate tart which were both filled with creamy fillings. Dessert was the highlight of the meal. The interior is still, after being open a year, like new. I really like the mix of styling and it's a very comfortable atmosphere (outside of the draft). We'll definitely be back soon as this could easily become a favorite Italian place in the Innenstadt. I am making a point of coming back and trying it out for lunch when I have business appointments."
3,"A good zoo. This place has been run idependantly by the Hagenbeck family for over 100 years and still has a nice, family run feel to it despite its size. They now also have a Troparium with more tropical animals including aligators and sharks. probably best to do the two parts of the park on different visits due to the cost. U2 line or various buses to Hagenbeck's."
3,"I was visiting the Miniature Wonderland and looked up restaurants that accept credit cards because a lot of the dining options around there only accept cash. I didn't convert my money as I was stopping in there for only a day. Figured you can use your card to pay at most dining establishments. Well, apparently not in Hamburg. When I tried to pay for my delicious crepe with a warm pear, I was told it was cash only. I offered to leave my card with them while I hunted down an ATM, but the obviously bothered waiter ran downstairs to get a POS machine and accepted my MasterCard. I tried to add a tip but was told they cannot add it to the card sale even though the print out indicated that option. Food and coffee were both amazing and they even offered me an English menu. I recommend this locale but be ready with local currency."
4,Incredible quality coffee. We ordered coffee on ice with hafermilch. It was deliciously creamy with perfect taste of incredible coffee. Nice modern interior! If you crave good quality coffee - this is your spot! I am not a coffee drinker but this one will make me turn into one
3,"Good place to get lunch! They seem to have three different meals to select from (not sure if threee different every day) and it's really affordable (3,90 EUR for a ""regular""). Tall costs a bit more, but I am not sure if you need that - I felt stuffed. :) Usually Indian places in Germany don't season the food very much, but this place is different. Pretty nice, especially since this is not a ""real"" restaurant, but a fast food joint."
4,I lovely little restaurant with fabulous staff. All the food courses were tasty and special. I would definitely recommend for dinner.
4,"Went here for breakfast and literally cannot fault the place. Sat outside on the cushioned windowsill in lovely nostalgic autumnal sunlight and drank coffees and heard fog horns from the river. We then sat inside for our food - sharing the one table in the place with a couple of other people. Beautiful platter of meat and cheese and perfectly cooked boiled eggs. Wonderful milchkaffee and the friendliest people run the place. Very relaxed, brilliant. Deserves some points for x-factor."
4,Very great cafe. Its such a nice crew there. It's the place to go. Food an drinks are cheap and great at the same time.
3,"Great, real Austrian place. You come for the Schnitzel and you return for the Schnitzel. Authentic menu with everything you'd expect from the Austrians from Nocken via Zwetschge to Kaiserschmarn. Obviously consistently good since the place still fills up in the evenings. Make sure to reserve. The smaller schnitzel is sufficient but if you're really hungry, go for the large one. It will satisfy. Service was also super nice and you could see they all care. We went home happy and will be back, sooner than later. My favorite schnitzel is still at Casse Croute in Hamburg but this place is a very close second and literally just a smidgen less good."
1,"If you need food come here, if you need good food, look elsewhere.Service is good, but it's not thai food they are serving, but on the other hand, it is boring and tasteless."
3,I've been dying to go back ever since I tried Kuchnia. Such a cozy atmosphere with a great selection of cocktails and wine and the pierogis were all so delicious.
4,"Like its St. Georg outlet cousin, Luicella's deserves the long line-ups on warm days - simply for the quality of their great ice cream. And given the location, you might even find more days without those long line-ups.This is a smaller place with a smaller assortment, and it's lacking the cute seating spaces.But they stock all their favorites, they will also give you an additional flavor to try out, and the taste is simply awesome."
1,Disappointing burger. The restaurant hat a really good rating but I wouldn't consider like a restaurant. It seems to be more like McDonald's.The burgers are okay but I would not come back here.
3,"This little beach bar is a Hamburg institution. Little did I know when I got there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon that they're actually open year-round. You can't really miss it as it's located in an old hut right at the beach Övelgönne.With 37F out there people were sunbathing (wrapped in their jackets like Eskimos, of course) and it's clear that this is one of Hamburg's hot spots to chill (or walk the beach).Strandperle serves coffee & tea, as well as soups and snacks. It's usually packed but the line moved quickly when I was there.I admit that I'm a tourist in Hamburg but this place is on my list whenever I'm back in the city."
4,"Your home away from home! No need to bring anything they've got it all here... your Kitchen, Laundry, Lounge, Dining, Bedroom (Including a comfy bed with duvet to snuggle up with.) and last but not least the games room at the back with a football table. Why have house parties in your own flat when you can use this place??No cleaning-up, the beers cheap and after a few drinks it really does feel like the place belongs to you and your mates. Brillent!"
2,"I was not happy with the cocktails I ordered: - Moskow Mule the taste was completely off and they did not serve it in a moscow mule mug- Whiskey sour is too sour :)The service was fast and friendly though, the atmosphere was a chillaxing one and the music was just right."
4,"Great restaurant that really has it all:* Fun location at the heart of bustling Eimsbüttel.* An eclectic interior design that mixes a boar's head with Riviera style bookshelves full of cook books and golden candlestick-holders.* A really innovative menu of German dishes with a modern twist.* And friendly staff with enough personality to give non-boilerplate recommendationsWe tremendously enjoyed the giant pork chops in cocoa cauce, goat cheese apple burgers, a lovely Spanish red wine made of Grenache and Tempranillo grapes, and a lovely sweet but crisp dessert wine that wasn't on the menu."
4,"The Hamburger Kunsthalle is a great art museum. It has different sections for old masters, 19th Century, modern art and contemporary art.  There are amazing paintings from Casper David Friedrich, Max liebermann, Edvard Munch, Max Beckmann and a lot of other famous artists. I enjoyed the visit very much."
1,"My husband managed to book a later dinner reservation to celebrate my birthday. Our reservation was at about 9:30 and the place was still pack. Even with a reservation we still had to wait about 15 minute or so to be seated. Once seated I saw that my husband left a note for them that it was my birthday and they had little happy birthday confetti on the our table which was a nice touch.After that I really didn't have a good experience with the service or the food sadly. Our waiter forgot our appetizers and Everytime we ordered drinks the drink servers looked confused and always ended at the wrong table first before realizing the drinks actually should go to ours. For our meal, we decided on the omakase which was like a 4 course chefs choice menu. Everything was a bit too oversauced for my taste and so the only dish I enjoyed and thought was unique was the dessert (which was more German than Japanese). And when it came time to pay the bill, our server was nowhere to be found...so we had to flag down a different waitress to get the bill.Overall, I probably won't be going back here especially not for a good sushi fix. It's overpriced for what it is and is not my vibe unfortunately."
4,"I went here last night with my family and we all absolutely loved this place! I got the spätzle with pesto,rocket and cherry tomatoes. The spätzle was perfectly flavored and had just the right amount of cheesiness. The cheese spätzle was also delicious. 5 stars, no doubts."
2,"Fine but not stellar sushi.  One of the few sushi places I passed on my wanders that actually had customers, which is a good sign.I got a basic Menu 4, with some roe-covered California rolls and two nigiri; the fish was in that middle bland area, not tongue-bursting fresh and not old.  Rice was fine, and not too gummy.OK if you're in the area, but maybe not worth much of a trip."
4,"Eiskantine, I am going to need new jeans soon because of you if I keep coming here so frequently.I have come here way too often in the last 2 months and every time is even better than the last. All of the flavours are absolutely delicious. An always changing collection of unique ice creams and sorbets."
3,"Monet, Renoir, Degas, Nardin, Valjoux, Rado, and Piaget!And if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that those last four are not French impressionists, they're Swiss watchmakers.Anyway, Kunsthalle is about as much fun as watching paint dry, as visiting this place basically amounts to three hours of watching dry paint. It's a very, very classic art museum. Mostly framed oil works, a little sculpture, a little modern art... not very stimulating to a layperson like me who just doesn't go for this stuff.So I'm not the best person to ask, but I think I can safely say this is a classic, non-interactive, super-quiet, admire-only, hands-off museum. Tickets are reasonably priced, they have student discounts, and all of the captions have English and German. Very Anglo/American friendly."
4,"Amazing place, details are unbelievable. What amount of work for completing it."
4,"On my travels I use to allow myself at least one dinner in a nice restaurant. This is definitely one restaurant that I would recommend to everybody making a stop in Hamburg. Forget stars and point! Nice place (and if you're luck to have seats in front of the canal it is really amazing!!), very welcoming staff, great dishes (maybe portions are too big) but presentation and quality have been really surprising. Price and quality give a really high rate to this cosy restaurant where decoration and staff make you feel at home!"
4,Delicious I didn't know kebabs could be this good!
3,"They sell Augustiner and good, cheap (before 10pm) cocktails. One problem seems to be that it gets a little too packed. We got there as early as 8pm (very early for a Friday night out in Hamburg) and even then we only managed to get half of the last table in the place. By the time we left, two hours later, it was so packed that you literally had to push people out of the way to get anywhere. Like a mosh-pit."
1,"Maybe it was because I was set on having an authentic California burrito experience that I was left so unsatisfied. I ordered the chicken burrito and knew what to expect in terms of presentation based on all the pictures on Yelp--wrapped in paper instead of foil and grilled. That's different, but no biggie. I was, for some reason, expecting to pick up the burrito and eat it like normal with my hands, but alas it was too overstuffed and soggy to do so. The mixture of the lettuce, rice, beans, and salsa tasted good, but the chicken lacked flavor. My hubby ordered the enchilada, which was a burrito smothered in mole sauce. The mole sauce was way too chocolatey, like milk chocolate was used in the sauce chocolatey.Yes, I know we live in Hamburg now and I shouldn't expect the same flavorful, meat and rice cooked in lard wrapped neatly in a heavenly package of greasy goodness...The place was quite crowded when we arrived but we were able to grab a booth in the corner. There is high turn over here, so you may only need to wait a little bit  for a free table. I did enjoy the luchadora theme decor. I don't think I'd come back any time soon, but if a hankering for a burrito or Mexican food  manages to overpower me, I'd give Jim Burrito another try."
2,"Tiefenthal is a café that's trying to be a restaurant as well as a bar at once. It's most successful at being an upper class café (and rallying point for yummy mommies and the like) and acceptable for a drink, but I'd avoid the more complex restaurant offerings. There's a simple rule: Tiefenthal is good at simple things - salads, roastbeef and sandwiches. Unfortunately though the chef struggles with anything more fancy; the more expensive, the worse, at least as far as I can speak from my own experiences. The Wiener Schnitzel, for example, is a disgrace and not even cheap. There are about a dozen places I know in Hamburg where you can get a much better quality Schnitzel for the same money (Casse-Croute near Gänsemarkt, for example). Another problem is the service. On a busy, sunny afternoon it can take ages before you get your homemade ice tea (which is wonderful, by the way). Most waiters/waitresses are professional at their job, but on occasion I've had to deal with one particular waitress whose attitude is rather bold (bordering on impertinent). All things considered I wouldn't mind visiting the place every once in a while, as long it's not for proper lunch/dinner. But then again, if you're allergic to the Eppendorf hoi polloi, you should avoid the Tiefenthal at any cost."
4,"The stuff there was really kind! Big portions, i tried 3 times. But I could never finish all  vegeterian burger with beans was really tasty! Worth trying."
3,"If you are looking for good German fair at a reasonable price, then you can't go far wrong here. Nagel is a traditional German pub, where you can drink and be merry.The food comes quickly and tasty, remember it is traditional so cash is the only way to pay for anything here."
4,"You know, I really didn't know that Hamburg is a Hamburger place so when we randomly googled and found this out, I knew I had to find a solid burger to enjoy while I was here! A quick yelp search brings up this place which was close to my hostel in Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and boy did the yelpers NOT disappoint! Unfortunately the infamous Lumper Jack wasn't on the menu but there's a ton of other options available. We came around 17:00 and it was empty--we almost hesitated going in but in the end, we were tired, hungry, and put all our trust in good reviews.My friend initially really wanted NOT a burger so if you're going for something besides a burger, they have like chicken fingers, a salad (yes, just one) and fish and chips. Also, if you're a vegetarian, there's a bunch of solid options on that end too. I couldn't decide from the loads of options, everything sounded amazing but in the end, I splurged for the Truffle Burger (7,90€)  and added an extra side of bacon (+1€). I also made it a meal by adding fries and a drink (3,90€ - choice of bottled beverages from waters to sodas to juices/lemonades to beer). My friend ended up getting the jalapeno burger (6,90€ i think?) with the meal as well.Our food came out pretty quickly and it was HUGE and honestly looked so delicious I barely got the plate and already started stuffing my face. I didn't even realize that they forgot the bacon at first until my friend realized they forgot to add it to hers too so we mentioned it and the chefs added it to the burgers. Holy moly, this burger is banging. The brioche bun has almost a pretzel-y flavor, almost smokey or whatever it is that makes pretzels get that rich brown colour. The burger was cooked a perfect medium (though I usually go for rare) and it was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The fillings were fresh, though the truffle flavor wasn't super present--the bacon really added another dimension of smokiness and honestly it was so good I had a hard time putting it down. The fries were really good too! Crispy but tons of solid potato flavor. When we paid, they asked if we wanted ketchup or mayonnaise but I wasn't sure if it was extra and decided against it. The fries honestly didn't need any sauce but if you want something additional, they do have choluha (reg, green, chipotle) and oil/vinegar. The beer was also very refreshing, and produced in hamburg which was pretty nice!The place is a order @ the counter, buzzer, seat yourself kind of place and is super clean with really nice bathrooms. The staff was really friendly and honestly, this place really was a winner! I don't know what people are talking about in terms of sports bar (?) but it just felt like a nice casual burger place. Definitely recommend!! So good and so glad I stopped in :)"
4,Love this place! Great burgers. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Asahi and saké with a Waygu Chesseburger and kimchi is hard to beat!
4,"Awesome place for super-competent cocktails including a few finds and specials. It is hidden away off the main Kiez strip in a residential block, and not a hip nor cool place. All the better!The drinks are stiff and their quality undisputed. And you won't go wrong simply ordering your favorite drink here for a 'how it should always be' version of it."
0,"We have been here for breakfast, but it was the first and last time! We had to wait a long time for our coffee and over 1h for a breakfast!! I had the vegan breakfast, because I was looking forward to the peanut butter. But it came without it. After asking they mentioned they don't have it anymore! Would have been nice to communicate it before because I was choosing the this breakfast because of the peanut butter! The quality of the food was okay, but nothing special and I had to peel the avocado and banana by myself. In the end the bill was 28€ which is not cheap for a breakfast and because of our issues I don't wanted to give a tip. And he just kept my 30€!!! I will never go there again!"
0,"I ate at this place approximately one year ago. It's an experience I'll never forget because at the end of our meal we noticed several mice crawling around the restaurant. To add insult to injury, the waiter seemed annoyed that we complained about it. It's a shame because the food was very good, but I'm not interested in eating anywhere that is infested with vermin, especially not after someone tells me it's to be ""expected because you're by the water"". I'm shocked this place stayed open. Here's hoping they've since cleaned up their infestation."
3,"Now, I was a bit apprehensive about how much I would enjoy this and how much time I could actually spend looking at miniature figures but, I surprised myself on how facilitating it all was.  All these tiny figures painted and positioned in such detail.  Every time you looked at something different you were stood for a while taking it all in.  Then you would spot something quirky going on like a naughty couple in the car or a random dinosaur lurking somewhere so then you start a little hide and seek to see what else you can find that no one else may have spotted.It isn't just figures standing around either.  Hit the buttons nearby to activate movement in certain areas.  Again, sometimes this took a while to spot what was actually moving/changing so absorbed more of your attention and time.The time, detail and effort put into everything is truly amazing and I think everyones favourite is the airport where you can want planes landing and taking off (I kid you not!).  There are things there that just make you stop and look and look and somethings which make you laugh.  You will be wandering around in here for some time and, depending on how busy it is, you will be surprised about how much time you actually spend in here.We came a little late in the evening so had to quickly move through the last part however, I know we could have spent another half hour there on just that bit having been there for probably 1 hour before hand.  We were able to move through fairly reasonable pace but if it is busy, I can imagine you would easily double this time.As they are adding countries and places to this all the time, I'd imagine you could come back in a few months to see more and spend equally as much time in here."
2,"Yep a pretty reasonable place to go eat. Has a prime position on the strip so you sort of expect it to be a littler below par, but it's not, it's pretty good all in all. Not amazing though, but at least you don't end up disappointed, that's the main thing. Service was attentive, and the beer tasted good, and a huge plate of Gyros for only Eur 7,00 was pretty good value, but most other dishes were around the standard 10 Eur mark. A nice touch here is the free Ouzo after the meal.It's definitely a better bet than Taverna Romano across the road."
2,"I was unimpressed by this place. Had wanted to come here for a while as I had heard good things. Well, we finally reserved a table and tried it out. Nice location, ok ambiance and fairly nice staff. Yet, the food is totally mediocre. There is nothing special about it and even though the menu changes on a regular basis, we found it tough to find something we ""really"" wanted to order. Almost left because of this but had a go at it anyway. Oh well, we should of maybe left yet then I wouldn't of known how the food was.We won't be back but maybe it's just not our thing. It was really full and this on a Tuesday night. People do seem to like the place and in general it is good. Yet, if you're here for the food, I'd go elsewhere.Finally, I ordered a souffle for dessert. After coming out once and telling us it collapsed and there were going to try again, they brought out a failed attempt. After two tries, they couldn't get it right. Hence they brought one out which was all over the plate. It still tasted fine but to be honest, I would of simply said, ""hey, we can't get the souffle right tonight....have something else and it's on us!"" This alone would of had me come back to give them another chance. Yet, nope, they basically said we can't get it right so eat it this way....regardless of the poor presentation of the dish.I know this is nitpicking but it's why I go to restaurants and don't cook for myself at home. The ""show"" is part of the reason I am willing to pay higher prices. Oh well, we'll find something else I am sure."
4,one of best pho in town.
4,"Easy atmosphere for an English speaker.  Good selection of local and regional beers.  I started with a sampler flight and moved on to local bottles.  Staff was willing to help with my selections since I didn't have knowledge of the region.  Bartender even went back to ask the owner about a selection she choose for me and then changed it on his suggestion.  Limited snack menu, but the pot roast style burger was good.  I'll be back."
4,"YES! This is the best little gem I was able to find in Hamburg.After being in Germany for a week, I had yet to have my favourite German food, Maultaschen.  I had one day left so quickly took to yelp to find a place that would serve this wonderful thing.Fortunately I came across Zum Spatzle!  We walked in when there were fortunately enough seats to accommodate us.  There are only about 10 tables in the whole restaurant so we were lucky to get a place for 3.This place is run by a one woman band, who takes your order and makes all the food for you.  Situated on a cozy little street, I would definitely recommend for lunch.And get the maultaschen with Egg (Ei).  It is amazing and I promise you you won't regret it."
4,"I've been coming here for like 11 years now.Hands down the best Greek place in the world!The prices are very fair, all the waiters are very nice and there is always loads of ouzo ;) I have always been bringing new people here over the last decade and everyone always came back for more!If you are looking for awesome bifteki, nice gyros and tasty zaziki - this is the place to go!But always, if you wanna come here reserve a table in advance, this is one of the busiest places in Eimsbüttel!"
4,"Excellent authentic food and atmosphere, great and friendly staff who went out of the way to seat us two on a booked out Saturday evening. You would never guess what a treasure is hidden inside by the exterior of the place, or by the location... so keep it a secret;)"
3,"Kornhauskeller is an extremely misleading name for a Lebanese/Syrian restaurant. Then again, they have a Wiener Schnitzel special on Thursdays, which isn't something you'd expect from your typical Lebanese restaurant.Confused identity aside, food and service are on point here. I usually go for their falafel plate with salad. The ingredients are fresh, the salad isn't just a few leaves of lettuce, the combination of dressing and harissa pairs really well with everything, and there is a good balance between salad and falafel.Service is efficient and attentive, sometimes to the point of lacking warmth, especially with the head waiter (and maybe owner?). That said, they handle large groups really well for such a small space. We had a group lunch with 11 recently and were comfortably seated inside. I don't think they'd be able to accommodate a much larger group than that, though. They also have outdoor seating when the weather warms up.For clarification regarding the two signs out front, Palmyra is the catering business (and also a much better name for a Lebanese restaurant)."
4,Very good food with cheap price especially for Arab people because you can fond traditional Arabic food. You can get all you can eat option with 7.5 euros. They have also good tea.
2,"I love places where the barkeepers give meChocolate. And here the location is one of the best in hamburg.The cocktails look good and fresh. They are overloaded with fruit decoration, the stuff is fast and nice.Here comes the but, there's always a BUT:They have a big whisky menu but no real good whisky. The middle class whiskys are just super expensive. The toilets have a good design but they smell and give the impression of not being clean. But they looked clean.The music was very good, I was close to dancing :DConclusion: It's nice to go out if one doesn't want drink whisky, just cocktails."
2,"I was taken by a friend here. Had heard of it before but never actually thought of going. I was quite excited to find another steak place as I love good meat. Anyway, came here to first be greeted by the horrible smell at the entrance of the buidling. OK, it's a meat market so I can understand the smell but it's just not the first impression you want when walking into a restaurant. Once upstairs, the decor is a bit bland and old fashioned. The night we were there it was also packed with senior citizens. We were by far the youngest there (outside of staff) and we're in our mid-thirties. Nevertheless, the steak was OK. I wouldn't say it was anything more than average though. I found the meat a bit tough as well. Service was quite good on the night we were there but in summary, decent meat and good service is the opposite of what I expected. Actually had the meat been better, I would of cared far less about everything else."
4,"Utterly charming, and obviously -- people know! My husband and I were taking a stroll around beautiful Hamburg on our last day, and happened to find ourselves faced with a 2 hour wait at the Miniature Museum (next time). A quick pop of the Yelp app and we found ourselves at Ti Breizh devouring gorgeous crepes within a few minutes. Now, this was midday on a Sunday -- it obviously gets very busy and is very popular, so typically reservations are recommended. This Breton-inspired, white wash wood interiored gem was just what we needed after a long night and heavy morning of walking. I chose the Nordic savoury crepe with loads for smoked salmon and fresh dill. Mmmmm, so nice. Served with a nice side salad. Though we weren't toting our toddler, it did some very kid friendly (at this hour anyway) with several children at most of the tables near us. Kid chairs available and by nature, crepes are very child approved! There's a small shop in the front selling clothing that fits the theme (ALL stripes), unfortunately they closed before I could finish eating so I didn't get a chance to peek around. I likely would've bought something, too. 5-stars easily -- sometimes there is a reason a place is so popular, and the reason at Ti Breizh is because it is fantastic. Next time -- dessert crepes with nutella and wine for days. Delightful."
3,Fantastic spot for crepes. Very authentically French. Was here twice during my visit to Hamburg and always had a great experience. The menu offers many different options from traditional dishes to more modern ones. Great selection of desserts too. There's a store and a great outside area next to a canal. A must in Hamburg.
4,"I didn't have really high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised! We arrived at 2pm on a Friday afternoon in April. They said we would need to wait 45 minutes, as they let people in on a co trolled basis to avoid overcrowding. We didnt mind waiting at all, since it gave us a chance to rest anyway. The exhibits are absolutely mind blowing in terms of the attention to detail. You can also see the artists at work, as they allow you to watch the creation of new displays.  You will get the sense of how painstaking it is to create all the displays that they did. We enjoyed the Italy displays the most. We felt the US displays were put together a bit too randomly.   For example, you have a backdrop of a tornado, against a space shuttle launch, situated next to Las Vegas and Miami beach. The US displays were also a bit sterotypical, which included a ""gold rush"" scene that didn't seem synced up. Lots of fun though. The displays include working trains, lights, transitions from day to night, etc. Plan to spend at least 2 hours there."
1,"Pretentious hipsters that make expensive, average food. :("
4,"if you visit hamburg, you must go to atlantik fisch! its definitely one of the best places in town to buy raw fish or to eat prepared fish. they offer delicious shells, salmon or backfischbrötchen inside and outside. in the summer months they have some tables out side between their custumers cars. forget the opening ours in this post. they are false. check their website for more current information concerning their opening hours"
0,"The burgers do not taste very good. The double patty burgers have the same amount of meat as a standard single patty burger. I ordered a rare hamburger and it came as well done. My girlfriend ordered a cheeseburger and it came with burnt cheese. When we sent it back, they said it was supposed to be crusty cheese. Cheese melted to a crust can be delicious, however the cheese was just burnt. I recommend going to the Brooklyn burger bar, its very close. Make reservations."
4,Probably the best colourful I have ever had. Highly recommend are coming here and eating their falafel plate.
4,"Wow. Really cool bar. I was well impressed to find the first Tornado table since I've been in Hamburg - good to know I can keep up the skills on this table type. Also, the tables are free, which makes it the first bar ever I've been in with free tables - simply unbelievable! The guys in here appeared to be of an incredibly high standard - will be good to get down here on weekends and check out the craic. One more thing. What is a washing machine doing in a bar? I need a drink, and some table football :-)"
4,"This is a MUST for anyone visiting Hamburg!The Speicherstadt is the largest warehouse district in the world, it's right by the harbour and the buildings are all built along various canals. Wares used to be brought here straight from the large ships and stored in the warehouses. There's still some trade going on here obviously, but there are also many quirky and interesting places to visit, including several museums and some renouned restaurants.This district was built in the late 1800s and rests on a timber foundation. If you stay long enough to catch dusk, it's simply gorgeous to wander around on the plethora of small bridges and canals. Well-placed lighting bathes the buildings and waterways in beautiful light.It's a really photogenic district with so many museums, restaurants and other interesting places, it might be worth just wandering around and seeing what you can discover."
4,"Probably the most comfy bar in the Sternschanze area. It is crammed with couches, a smoking area is in the basement.ZIII has an adequate amount of drinks on the menu, but no food. That shouldn't be a problem, the Sternschanze is bustling with places to eat.Prices are average and below, drinks are always great.The barmaids seem to be chosen by their great looks and their permanent good mood.English is spoken."
4,"Cozy interior, outdoor seating, very nice staff and relaxed atmosphere. And most importantly - delicious food!! We've tried 4 different dishes so far and they were all really high quality and very well made!"
4,"A great Turkish lunch spot, with tasty food and incredibly fast service! I'm usually here atleast once a week for lunch. I really like the chicken with rice plate, and mixed sharp/yogurt sauce. The staff is really friendly; you can get by with English if necessary. Seating is kind of hard to come by around lunch, but they have mixed standing/seating areas. Even if you don't stay, there is someone always offering tea, which is such a nice treat."
4,"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the Schanze, definitely my favourite Greek restaurant. I remember coming here a while ago on a Friday night after work with a couple of colleagues and they told me straight away that I should have Gyros mit Pommes because it was delicious andit didn't fail the expectations! After that first time I've been here a few times more, never bothered to try something else  apart from Gyros mit Pilsen & Pommes, which wasn't as awesome as I expected but still really tasty.Prices are definitely ok, you must pay cash which is not unusual in Hamburg, and the service is the best I've experienced and I remember of. They're always super bizy but somehow they always manage not to screw up and to bring you food after a reasonable waiting time, so props. Last couple of things worth mentioning: 1) they've got a couple of TVs inside, so you can watch Bundesliga or Champions League games and 2) if you pay at the counter you're usually asked if you want some Ouzowhich comes for free! :-) I'll come back here over and over again."
3,"A great place for a get-together.  The atmosphere is inviting, buzzing;  the lighting, the sparking glassware here, the stacked bottles there,  the open table seating with little nooks here and there - - it is a great place to be.  The drawback being, that it gets loud.The food is on one page at the back of a massive drinks menu, but the quality shines.   The salads were big and beautiful,  and the flammkuchen with crème fraîche, spring onions, speck, and pfifferlinge was perfect - - beautiful balance of ingredients, satisfying creamy base, and just delicious.The wines were OK.  The recommended red from our stellar server opened up nicely over time.  My two whites had character, but were nothing I'd buy in.    The staff were knock-out attentive, gracious, and capable.   The were super busy, but always responsive."
4,"Imagine being the coldest you've ever been, yet happily chilling at a lovely beach bar sipping on a super delicious Pimm's cocktail and eating what appears to be one of the only 3 vegetarian items on the menu. Are you imagining this?It is amazing. Fun decor, great people, interesting bathrooms, and a really great casual vibe. Come for the drinks and the great view. Eat something so you don't get totally wasted. Drink some more and then vow to return. Rinse and repeat."
3,"After a long afternoon of shopping/windown shopping in what is probably our favorite street in Hamburg we decided to rest our shoppign weary feet and grab a coffee. This place although large with four different seating areas it's still hard to find a place to sit. the place looked good though so we thought it was worth the 5-10 minute wait for a good seat. The lattes were decent, the cake moist, menu is well priced and atmosphere is chilled out and relaxed. A perfect place for brunch with friends or just afternoon coffee and cake. Good service too although you have to order and pay at the bar."
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this yet. When I arrived in Hamburg I heard much about the history of Absinth bar, but wasn't able to go there as it had just shut down. However, daily I saw the guy trekking through the streets of Hamburg covered in brickdust, on the 1.5 year epic to refit the place. It was definitely worth it. Very very chic. Tasteful furniture and a minimalist wrought iron and glass bar. Cool. And they play jazz in here. Well, actually, of course they place jazz in here. It's cool. Like 60s cool. Old school cool. This is one of the best bars in Hamburg, so make sure you drop by. And don't drink anything other than absinth. One of the dev team disgraced themselves having a soft drink. Shocker."
3,"Very much Italian ran and very, very good. Although you sit inside, most of summertime business happens just off the sidewalk. I have even watched a dude ride up to the counter on his bike, order, pay and leave--all without bothering to dismount. Overall, if you happen to be in the area--and are jonesing with the 'you scream I screams'--by all means stop, walk or roll in for a cone. If are on a quest for the 'Best in Hamburg', Eiscafé Veneziana will at least make the short list."
4,"Einfach unglaublich köstlich, supernette Bedienung und ein urgemütliches Lokal. Volle Punktzahl!"
4,"Love this bar! Great vibe, surprisingly awesome food, some really good craft beer on tap and it's in a cute area."
4,"Really nice pho and ambitious pricing. It doesn't get better than this. I tried the hamburg version, and it's filled with all sorts of goodies, as you would expect from a pho."
4,"OMG.... great coffee - fair prices- great authentic atmosphere- super friendly staff! I arrived after a long trip and was super tired - was greeted with ""moin"" and felt like home straight away. I ordered a large cappuccino and the ""katzenfrühstück"" ... basic scrambled egg with Toast! Simple but delicious"
2,"Quite expensive, waiters try to sell you most expensive food without prices. Nice atmosphere and chic. I would go there again, but oder less food."
3,"On our first night in Hamburg after making the big move from SF, we had our celebratory dinner here. Badshah wasn't hard to find though the signage might not be super obvious when it's dark. The restaurant is pretty small, but tables seem to turn quite fast. We each ordered the Thali plate, mine with the chicken tikka masala and his with the palak paneer. Both were very tasty. I ordered the mango lassi as well and it was probably one of the better mango lassis I've had. Service was quick, the staff was friendly and price point was decent. Overall, very on par with anything we'd get in San Francisco, which is great!"
4,"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Hamburg. Cafe Mexico has dishes I haven't found at any other Mexican restaurant in the area - chilaquiles, tamales, nopales, you name it. Its obvious the kitchen staff are using high-quality ingredients and making everything from scratch. The drinks menu is extensive and the margaritas are small and potent. I went with a large party of friends last year and the waiter gave us all a free shot of tequila at the end of the meal. Service was great - the waiter took the time to explain different dishes to us and slipped in and out of German, English and Spanish depending on who he was talking to in our group."
4,"If you go to Hamburg, even without your kids, you must go visit this place. It is fantastic! But go there late in the evening or very early in the morning - else there will be to many tourists.Expect to use minimum 2 hours there, even though you do not think a mini-world is anything for you, this place is a must see."
2,"I enjoyed a lunch here with some coworkers. The environment is really nice, it looks like a typical German restaurant. The location is really good, basically in the city center, you can easily reach it from the U-Bahn. The quality of food was good, I took a ""Jägerschnitzel"". Unfortunately, the service was a bit low. They took more than 30 mins to deliver the dishes..."
2,"Very average indian food. Veg thali was better than other dishes. But, i guess that's okay with that price. Also, you can buy fresh sweets and bhujiyas which are really good. I also bought panner (cottage cheese) for my home and it was really good!"
2,"Yes this is a strange one. This restaurant benefits from being in the middle of one of the busiest restaurant areas in Hamburg. So it's more or less always going to be pretty busy. So we were very grateful when we found a table here without having booked. Four adults and 2 kids, it was great, especially when they asked another table to shift off their place for us. Then we watched all night as they moved people around the place all night as new people arrived. I haven't seen that before! It was also freezing outside, but boiing inside, and every time the door opened (which was a lot) we all got a blast of icy air! Overall it wasn't bad, the food was OK, then we had a little dance at the end when we were told they didn't take credit cards but then when I pulled out my Qype wallet, hey presto all of sudden they did! Which was very strange!"
4,"This vegan restaurant made my Hamburg experience so much better! The food was amazing, with a great selection of different food all for a very reasonable price. The staff was wonderful, and the place was decorated with a very cute theme. The bathrooms downstairs were really nice and chock-full of amenities. I will definitely be coming back here!"
4,"This is a fantastic beautiful park based near the centre of Hamburg, Lazy sunny afternoons lounging around with friends, playing frisbee, lovely walks this is the place to be. There is a good childrens play area, and a paddling pool. Theres a large pond where you can sail remote control boats etc. There are lots of trees and pathways and you can see the planetarium from the edge of the park. Really nice place to relax."
4,"Wonderful meal. Incredible service. Charming ambiance even the clientele looked hand picked for this place. Family nights out, fancy dinner dates, groups of friends catching up over a long French dinner. All represented tonight. I had the snails to start. (They are not in shells. They come in a hot pot pre stewed) it's was wonderful if a tad salty. Scampi provencal for the main was perfect. I wiped the sauce with extra bread. And the standout of the evening for me, the desert (who would have thought it, not I) the apple pancake soaked in a very lightly sweet liquor and Caramelized sugar on top. Not sure what wine I was served but it was great too."
0,"I don't know if it was because we ate there late on Valentine's Day and the chef was just fed up or something, but we had a *terrible* experience here. The restaurant was freezing cold.The food took a very long time to come out, despite it being a menu fixe.Every dish was overcooked except the dessert, which was completely uninspired. The food was pretty expensive for what it was. The decor was unimpressive and there is no decent view, which is too bad for a restaurant so close to the water. I really cannot recommend it."
3,"Wow - all the hype is accurate! Really good/incredible cakes and coffee. Minus one star because it's so busy and loud. We came at 4pm on a Friday, prime Kaffeeklatsch time and it was really busy. The cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had, the poppy seed mousse cake with cassis was also incredible but my rhubarb meringue cake was disappointing. The cake was flavorless, the filling was really solid, and the meringue was weepy. Pour over coffee was great too. Will absolutely be back. I wish they had a cookbook I could buy!"
4,Amazing experience! Really good service and even better food. Felt like an evening in Thailand - definitely value for money!
4,mr t burger changed my life! chipotle chilli sauce is digusting but every taste is different. the portion of sweet potatoe fries is too small for 4 EUR. overall its one of the best burger i had so far. thanks mates!
3,Good place to eat. Sometimes jut to crowded and so it's not easy to find a place to sit. To order goes pretty fast. The atmosphere is not the best. But good food weighers it out.
3,"This one is not a restaurant, more a takeaway and a snackbar!I can recommend to take away, because its really full inside and the service its not the perfect one. But if you eat inside (or in the summer outside), the waiter is really nice and helpful!! Food: huge portions and yummy :D Some days,they are really bussy, but you should wait :D and try the dönerteller with fries :D enjoy your food!!"
3,"I go here quite a lot as its just down the road, does very nice food but most importantly we get a great welcome.There are probably hundreds of Italian restaurants in Hamburg, but this is the place where we take Qype staffers visiting the city for the first time.It usually has a table, and the prices are pretty keen as well."
4,"Toller Cocktailladen mit sehr nettem Service. Wir kommen immer gerne her, weil die Cocktails lecker sind, man gut beraten wird, die Musik meistens gut ist und eigentlich alles zusammen passt."
0,Slooooooooow.Bad fries. Waited over 30 minutes for a draught beer and lemonade.Capacity (outside) approx 56. There were around 10-15 people.Now it's 35 minutes.
3,"Really nice bar in the middle of Schanze, with really nice bartenders and good cocktails. It usually becomes very crowded at around 10 or 11. Plus they've got an almost hidden table football that ends up being one of the distinctive reasons to go there and have fun challenging friends."
2,The Joh. Albrecht Brewery is located at a fleet close to the town hall. If you are lucky or reserve a table you can have a great view of the fleet. The decoration is typical for a German brewery restaurant and the staff was very nice. The food was solid German food. With fair prices considering the size of the dish and the location of the restaurant. The beer (brewed at the restaurant) is very good and there is an offer of different kinds. Enjoy :-)
4,"After a wonderful Hamburg harbor tour, we found our way to the Fairmont Hotel-recommended Clouds for the view, drinks and some food. It was sunny but cool and windy and our group of 7 found the top floor outdoor bar not right for us so we went down one floor to the inside bar/restaurant. We were told that area wasn't open for another 2 hours but we stayed to take in the great view and plan our next moves. When I approached the bartender (Dougie sp?) to discuss our options, he quickly provided menus for drinks and food, not at other places, but at Clouds. I finally got it that it was fine to stay and he was incredible with prompt beers, two bottles of wine, snacks and food. He even provided a complimentary strawberry champagne drink and nachos. He made our afternoon even more delightful and was another wonderful example of the welcoming attitude of the great people of Hamburg. Don't miss enjoying Clouds! What a great bartender and an employee of Clouds. Thanks!"
4,"FANTASTIC! Loved it! My husband and I went there for lunch about 2 weeks ago and we were both very pleased with our pizzas. I was able to get a vegan pizza, he was able to get a meat pizza. Both of us gobbled up the whole thing."
3,Sorry ppl forgot to take picture.. But food was deeelish! Nom nom nom.. Service was also very beautiful. Ordered Lamm w Saffron.. Not sure the name.. Lentil soup was also very good.. Get urself the Lassi's.
3,"Great food but a bit too crowded. The system there is really good, though: You get a streetname assigned to your order which is then called out when your food is ready to be picked up. No starbucksy name-guessing on both ends. The burgers are good, but not really spectacular. Too bad you can't upgrade the Pulled Beef burger to include more meat. Good value for the money, though. Not sure why they need plates, though. That being said, it definitely gives Jim Block definitely its own flair."
3,"This Indian restaurant defines exactly what needs to be important to stay in business in competitive Food industry. This is very well placed restaurant, just 5 mins walk away from Railway Station. It doesn't have any super decorative stuff or some light show on the outside, but still it's not very difficult to find. I shouldn't actually call it a restaurant, but it's more of self service Diner. No fancy decorations or extra comfortable seats to make you sit there for really long time, some light music, everything is surprising. But the best part is food. No Hocus Pokus or 20 pages Menu which makes consumer's life very easy. Food is really very good with prices worth to make student's life easy. I really liked the Lamb Curry there. It's highly recommended. The restaurant also has many varieties of Indian sweets for take away. The food is served in traditional Indian Plates called Thali which was a nostalgic experience - reminded me of Langar (practice common to few Indian religions of community eating). I feel happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys and loves food (while ignoring the ambiance)## The place if often really crowded, which is always the best sign. ##"
4,Great restaurant with delicious Food and services! Highly recommend it! Pho is pretty authentic Vietnamese northern region. We went there a few times when we're in Hamburg.
3,"This place is right around the corner from the Hauptbanhnhof and well worth a visit. It has a patio and limited seating inside but it was pretty empty when I got there and it was a Saturday afternoon. Service was perfect - they greeted me and sat me down right away and came only when I needed them. The menu is a fusion on Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai...I opted mainly for Thai. I asked for my noodle dish to be spicy, and I got what I ordered. Everything was made fresh and tasted delicious though I'm wary of restaurants that do different cuisines. I had my first Viet coffee and it was great even though I drank it incorrectly. Prices were average for this type of fare and food similar to what you could get in centrum without the huge crowds. I'd definitely come back if I'm in town again!"
4,"Wonderful place. The food was delicious and authentic, and the woman helping us had a great personality and was very helpful (and she spoke excellent English)."
2,"Got much better since they cleared the view of the ships.Really, the main reason to be here is that next-door classic Strandperle is too crowded, again.Food is a little bit cheaper, but also less good. But that's not why you are down here.It's the view, the beer, the sun, the beach.Feels a tiny bit less professional than Strandperle, and that's a good thing too."
3,"I give Xeom a solid four stars. It would be five, except that I really like Vietnamese noodle bowls (Bun), and theirs is pretty mediocre. The noodles are extremely thin and flimsy, and clump together in the bowl. If you like soup (Pho), though, then you're in good shape. Theirs is delicious (I had the chicken soup). There isn't much spice in the food, but there is a bottle of Sriracha on the table if you need a kick.The menu is pretty standard Vietnamese, with the aforementioned noodle bowls and soups, along with some salads and other specialty dishes. They have a large selection of drinks; I had the lemonade last time I was there, which was nicely presented and delicious.The dining room is small and cramped, and they're frequently packed for mealtime. We arrived around 12:30 for lunch and didn't have trouble getting a seat, but it gets packed around 1 PM. The chairs are all stools, and there are no coat racks, so you kind of have to make do if you have a coat with you.The staff is nice, and seems to all speak English, in case you need an assist. The prices are very fair. Overall, one of the better dining options in the city, just wish their Bun was tastier."
2,"Was here today for lunch. The lunch prices are really good (6 euro for a pizza and glas of watter) and the Pizza is very good. If you don't care about more, you may like or love it.I reduce two stars on the review, because this location is very dark inside and felt like a dinner in the dark. Second point is the service, which was very unfriendly. We got a bunch of forks and knives thrown on the table, so we had to collect them from the table. The order was hard to place, because the worker doesn't want to help or explain and was permanently in a hurry. At least we got the bill for 6 persons together, even we asked to pay seperate. I will maybe try it again to another time or directly for a take away. All other restaurants in the near have the same problem at lunch and still can act friendly."
3,"Pretty much all bars on Hamburger Berg are the same, and Roschinsky's is no exception to that! Packed to the rafters every Thursday till Sunday, lots of drunks, students, and sweating people jumping up and down. Good stuff."
4,"This was the most amazing food I tasted in months! The hejpapa-crew didn't pay me for saying this  they just surprised me with quality food, best coffee (as good as kopiba coffee) and very good service. People, you should come here.Last not least, they have free WLAN."
2,"Everytime i get non-german visitors we go to schweinske.it's an institution!! they have a wide choice of food, for very reasonable prices. Their salads are good, their hambrugers are good, their steaks and wurst are good! worth a try! Guten appetit ;)"
3,"I wouldn't normally go to a restaurant this close to the Reeperbahn, but a colleague assured me that this place was worth it, and boy was he right! I can't remember the exact name of the dish, but it was pasta with meatballs or perhaps sausage meat and it was amazing. Probably the best pasta I've had in Hamburg. The location is a bit odd (you have to dodge the local prostitutes to get there), but once inside it's nicely decorated and they even have a small outdoor area out the back for those warm summertime evenings. The food is a bit more pricey than most Italian restaurants in Hamburg. A pasta dish will set you back about EUR10 and a meat or fish dish will be more like EUR20. Overall: great food, odd location."
4,"So good. This is my second trip to Hamburg and my second time here. Came originally because my gf had raved about their lentil soup, and she's right to do so - it's the best. The pide and lahmacun are delicious. And the main dishes are outstanding. Today I had the yogurt kabab and it was great. Chill vibe, friendly staff, good prices, fantastic food."
1,"Cool ambience place that was full, people were in a waiting list for tables.Thank goodness I just wanted to pick up some take away.I had to wait forever for a menu since the waitress that wanted to get me one just disappeared. After searching for another waitress I got one.I asked for a Bacon Burger with double patty and asked for it to be rare. They told me they only do medium. Since that always means it's dreadfully overcook I asked for it to be as rare as they can possibly do it. I also ordered chili cheese fries for over 6 euros and an Oreo shake for 5 euros and 2 dips.After a while I received my food and went home:A dip was missing. The very very expensive chili cheese fries were literally a small portion of normal fries with a tiny cheese dip on the side (over 6 euros!).And of course, the burgers were dreadfully overcooked. All grey & dry. Meat densely pressed together, not a single trace of anything even remotely pinkish. (While waiting for my food I have seen some burgers with pink Centers being medium, still not rare enough).The shake was VERY tasty. It was really really good. But the price of 5 euros for the small amount is not justified at all. The price of the ridiculous fries took the cake.Always looking for good burger places this place showed potential but disappointed with extreme prices for deceiving product and tough meat that was pressed too hard. Ground meat needs to be fluffier.My 25 Euro tab was just disappointing, considering I did not even get one of my tiny 2 Euro dips."
2,"The food here is simply excellent.HOWEVER, the service is arrogant and unfriendly to say the least. Be prepared to be treated dismissively and rudely."
4,A good quick overview of Indian food and taste in the center of Hamburg. Super cheap small 4.90 and large portion 6.90. Totally recommend this place if you are a tourist and would want a quick food. Very crowded
3,Fast takeout. A little pricey. Bf got a Bulgogi burger and he absolutely loved it. I got some edamame. Very delicious but could have been larger portions for the price. There seemed to be plenty of space outside for eating but the place was very popular and busy so all the tables were full. Vegan menu was fairly limited. Overall would recommend for adventurous eaters who aren't starving
3,"Went here with someone who had already been there once. I am impressed. Reminded me of the restaurant in the Alsterhaus where you can pick your own food (raw) and have it prepared in front of you. The selection at Copper House is much more extensive and the price is right if you are hungry. I truly enjoyed the food as you can have it made exactly as you wish with the specific sauces you choose yourself. Service is also super nice and I never felt like anything lacked. They didn't bother us when we didn't want to be bothered but were right there as soon as you needed them. Drinks were good as well. Finally, I didn't really miss a large dessert selection as I was already so full from the three plates I had prepared, mostly with fish and vegetables. One minus point is that I am getting somewhat tired of this design style. It looks like every other designer place. It's quite nice so don't get me wrong. It's just not different."
3,"Sit-down service only. I was early for an appointment and stopped in to get a latte macchiato to go. No paper cups = no coffee to go. :-( Too bad. I could imagine picking up a coffee and then strolling around in the park across the street afterwards. Regardless, the place looks extremely cute and was seemingly full for the time of day and time of week. I will come back and try out the food. UPDATE: Had some time this week to relax at a cozy table and enjoy a cup of coffee with the fluffiest milk foam I've seen in a while. It's the end of winter and from where I'm sitting, there's a perfect view of the Antebellum Gossler House up on the hill. This is such a cute place. Antiques carefully selected give this place real charm and character and warmth. While enjoying the dusk and eavesdropping to whispered conversations in the next room, I made my next happy discovery: the best cheesecake this side of the Atlantic - moist, like those in the US, without being too heavy."
2,"This is OK Thai food for people who are not overly fussy about Thai food.I usually have pretty specific ideas about what the food I order is supposed to taste like. Nothing we ordered here tasted the way I thought it should have, but it was nice enough all the same.My husband ordered the cashew chicken which was generously portioned with nuts, veggies and meat in a flavorful sauce.I ordered a Tom Kha Gai which was a bit bland, but I soon fixed that up with some chilis in fish sauce (what they bring you in lieu of hot sauce). Was pleased. But then came my fried noodles which, in all fairness, more or less the exact same thing one gets at whatever Hamburg's equivalent of China Box is. Sure, it had bok choy and lots of meat in it, but it was absolutely flavorless and uninspired.We couldn't find anything resembling Phad Thai on the menu; maybe it was there and we missed it, but I was pretty disappointed about that. None of the awesome rice noodle dishes, no Pad See-Ew either.For the price, I thought we could have done much better at the dim sum up the street or even at the China Wok imbiss at the train station.The service was competent and the food was not bad, but we work hard for the little money we have and will spend it elsewhere in the future. Nothing wrong with paying a decent price for good food but that was not really what we found herejust mediocre versions of potentially amazing dishes for people without a lot of experience with Thai cuisine."
0,"Walked in without a reservation expecting to have to wait a long time and instead got a death stare and a NO!  Hey, how about so sorry but please come back when you  have a reservation, but no we got the dirtiest look. How dare we try to eat there!"
4,I ordered flat white and I must say that I've never before had such a good coffee. Might consider moving my home office here :-)
0,"Watch out, they close at random times. After a long slog through the cold and rain, we walked through their front door and were told they're closing at 9:30, even though they normally close at 11. No explanation was given. It was only 9:20 when we got there, but they refused to seat us anyways. I was really looking forward to eating here, so their complete lack of consideration really pissed me off. In spite of their good reviews, they're not worth it."
4,"Cheap, cheerful, and even though it was ragingly busy late on a Friday night, the waitresses got us our food hot and all together after only a reasonable wait. Very popular, quite loud, pleasant décor, often packed.Guinness on draft, Duckstein available, and some of the best schnitzel I've had in Germany. My dining companions also felt very happy with the potato skins and the cheeseburger they ate. Absolutely recommended."
3,"Why has nobody ever reviewed Rosi's Bar in English? Could it be because whenever the English end up this far into a St. Pauli weekender they can no longer differentiate between any of the bars on Hamburgerberg?! I suspect so. Anyway, Rosi's trivia: the girl with the dreads from Zoe 2 DJ's here at the weekends sometimes. It's always packed Thursday till Sunday morning. It doesn't look anything like the photo, cause you have to imagine the mass of people sprawled on the pavement. All good fun, and probably better than the Reeperbahn"
3,"I chose this place based on the comments on qype!It's a small restaurant/café in the Hamburger Hof 'mall'.We got there on a tuesday at around 6pm. It was empty, so we got to choose the table we found most appealing.The menu has a wide variety of food including salads, soups, pasta and pizza. They also have the Menu of the day which is written on a blackboard. It includes dishes that arent listed on the 'normal' menu.They also have an extra coffee menu. I had a salad, the rucola/schafkäse salat, which was really really good. The portion is rather generous. It's not very expensive.Two persons, 2 drinks was at around 20EUR. Very fair for what they're offering. I'll definitely be back"
3,"It'sbeen ages since I was at Panter last time. To my satisfaction my visityesterday confirmed that: a) this place is as cool as it was before b) cosy, unpretentious, good quality c) friendly service d) unfortunately limitedchoice of drinks, i.e. wine This place will suite you if you are looking for a nice & cosy place to have a coffee and chat. It's not spectacular, just good."
3,"Another pizza success! Came to Al Volo for a lovely Saturday lunch. We arrived right at opening time so there was only one other table occupied. The interior looked nice and new. We sat at one of the tall tables with stools. I ordered the Margherita while the Mr. ordered pizza salame. The dough was thin and chewy, just how I like it. The toppings were also very tasty; the salame had quite a bit of a kick! The size of the pizza was just enough--not too much, not to little. We washed it down with some wine. The location of the restaurant is in a nice area, so great way to have some good pizza and go for a stroll afterwards."
4,Very nice place to look at from both the inside & the outside. The building is clean and well maintained! Don't forget to sign the guest book!!
4,"One of my favourite restaurants of the area. They got a lot of nice Portuguese and Spanish food on offer as well as the usual San Miguel and Sagres beer. Loads of yummy seafood things (meat, too, for all you carnivores) and great tapas. All very delicious. Aioli and bread will get served before the main meal so you can feast on that first. And it's worth it. Even though your partner / colleagues will hate you later on / the next day.The waiters are really pleasant - and always happy to deliver a wisecrack on top of it all.Prices are moderate especially compared to the other Portuguese restaurants in the middle of the street.It's strongly recommended."
3,"Very delicious sushi & tepanijaki place. Great price for the value, recommend! But come with an empty stomach - u eat a lot"
4,"You probably won't find any better burgers here in Hamburg! Top 5 burger I've ever had, and I tried two! The 'BBQ burger' and the 'Mushroom burger'.Great beers as well and great service!If you like burgers, this is the place in Hamburg!"
4,"If I was ever to make a lunch- and coffee spot, this would be the perfect model for it. You can tell a lot of passion has gone into this place.It's simply brilliant. The decor is so trendy, in my mind it could be a magazine cover. And there's full insight into the kitchen, so there's no doubt that the food is   the real deal. As if there ever would be any once you've tried it. The food isn't fancy, but the the quality in all of it's simpleness is incredible. It's like something your grandma would cook.The location, if you don't know it, is a really friendly, hipster-y part of town with various stores selling all kinds of pretty things you don't really need... So there's things to see here, and this is the perfect place to take a break.To address previous reviewers: I ordered in english without any problems; cashier was both patient and helpful."
4,"I am so happy finding this place through windy day of Hamburg. Despite of its small space and no chair, their food is super satisfying. That day, they only sold two choices of dishes: spaghetti (€7) and lasagna (€12). I ordered spaghetti topped with sorta white fish and tomato sauce. It came with big portion for my late lunch. The fish topping was generous and its sauce is pretty good, not too sour. You can choose some of beverages served. I ordered ingwer-minze-tee because I need hot beverage to reduce the windy effect to my body. I think I chose the right drink because it really boosted my mood. Thanks!!"
2,"I was curious because I saw these places all over Hamburg and I love Asian fusion! I have to wait 30 minutes to get my food. Also, I probably have a different working definition of what Asian fusion is...I ordered a vegetarian curry.... It said it came with tofu, but I couldnt really find any on the plate. Plus for an ""imbiss"" this place took forever. But I have to admit, the vegetables were fresh and I liked how they had sauces out on the table. I ordered spicy and although it wasn't spicy enough, I could pile on as much Siracha and chilis as I wanted. (People started to stare.) Everything here is gluten free so I guess that is great if you have food allergies. But really, the majority of asian food just tends to be gluten free in general. No surprise there. This place seemed pretty popular. It was hard to find a seat and I don't really know why. They have locations all over the city and are open late, so it is pretty convenient. Foodwise, it is just like any other semi-palatable Asian place."
4,bestice creamevertry snickers!! It was incredible and I would go there any time. Little expensive but totally worth it
4,"Das Restaurant is einfach genial! Sehr schön, wirklich leckeres Essen mit einer super Präsentation, und vor allem echt nette Bedinung!! Wir waren zur viert, zwie hatten nur ein Hauptgericht bestellt und die zwei andere Hauptgericht+Vorspeisen. Die Kellner sind einfach mit zwei extra Mini-Vorspeisen angekommen, damit die zwei mit Vorspeisen nicht allein essen. Das war einfach Klasse. Die Preise sind ein bisschen höher als normal. Wobei ist es nicht übertrieben für die Qualität vom Essen und vom Service! (ca. 18-25eur für ein Hauptgericht). Dieses Lokal ist wirklich zu emfehlen!"
2,"Sorry fellas, but it's NOT like being on the real beach: so damn packed you can't even strech your legs and the view is non-existent due to the monstrous Blohm&Voss shipyard with all the noise from welding and construction (is it another yacht of Abramovich?) Well, actually it's not that bad, better than infierno of the cement and glass in the city on a hot summer day. They have cocktails, they have beer, they have sand - but that's about it."
4,"I am always a little nervous about engaging with vegetarian food, but this has definitely altered my perspective. Delicious falafel dishes and good beer options make this the perfect place to settle into for an early evening meal. The food came really quickly, was well priced and the atmosphere in here is very relaxed. Although I haven't yet sampled the pleasures of the takeaway, I was glad to see they do this. Living locally, I will definitely be taking advantage of the takeaway dishes on offer."
3,We've been there for the third time. Cute place for breakfast and coffee. Average friendly service. Unfortunatelly rather slow if its crowded which happens pretty much every weekend. The food is good and not too pricey. The decoration really catches the swedish atmosphere. We'll probably come back!
2,"Had a moderately-sized schnitzel here for lunch today. It really hit the spot without being amazing. I ordered a Jägerschnitzel (comes with Mushrooms), but those who ordered just a plain schnitzel got monstrously big ones! The service was unintrusive and reasonably prompt. The prices are great. Schnitzel and fries for 5eu :) --- Further to the above review, I've since been back twice. The first time was much the same, but the second time they were incredibly inattentive and slow. It took them literally 15 minutes to notice that our group of 15 had walked through the door. They then took forever to bring a few of the meals, and my schnitzel had a large fraction of inedible gristle in it. I'd still go again, but they're losing a star off the rating."
2,"The new Jim Block is really shiny looking, probably due to it's position next to the Alster where everything seems shiny and expensive. Thankfully the burgers are the same price as everywhere else. I should mention for those unfamiliar with the Jim Block franchise that they're a sort of classier fast-food burger joint. You get a real plate and cutlery and you can choose a beer as part of the meal-deal. The burgers are better than standard fast food burgers, and the fries are pretty decent too. If you want a quick burger I'd recommend this place. However, in the context of Jim Block restaurants, this one is super-busy. They don't seem to have any more staff though, and do the service really suffers. Last night there were 5 staff and only 2 people ahead of me in the line, but it still took me 10 minutes to get served. I shudder to think how long it'd take with a line out of the door (I have seen this)."
4,"Nice informal atmosphere, simple but cracking menu, country potatoes are the absolute best in Hamburg."
4,"Best pizza in Hamburg, and not exorbitantly priced. Their salsiccia pizza is amazing."
3,"This place blows the Miniature World in Victoria, BC.  Respect to the people who created this place.  I noticed the awesome replicas of Las Vegas, New York, and Hamburg.  The model of the Hamburg Airport was pretty cool with planes departing and landing with day and night scenes.  A must stop for anyone visiting Hamburg."
1,"I really tried to like it because of good comments I heard from friends. However, I can't say that my experience was great. I ordered the Avocado Burger, and so did two other colleagues. When the burgers arrived, they all looked very different (I know we ordered different buns) but overall, the patties and the presentation was way too off. Mine looked flat and uninspiring. The flavor was not that bad, but maybe not worth the high price."
3,"Came here early yesterday night between two apartment visits. The restaurant was approximately empty with only a single table occupied. It took about 3 minutes for the hostess to seat us which felt like an eternity. How many reservations can you possibly have on a Monday night to not be able to seat 2 people at 6 pm??Afterwards, the service quirks continued. For the first time since we arrived in Germany (~2 weeks), we dared to do the unthinkable: Order 2 glasses of tap water. We were not disappointed. At first the waitress made me repeat what I said, although I'm pretty sure that she perfectly understood the first time. Then she wrinkled her nose and went away. A little while later, the other waitress came back with 2 glasses of water on a tray and asked us: ""Is this what you ordered? Really?"" Haha, what a laugh! It is well known that German restaurants do not like to serve tap water and that they would rather sell you bottled water, however I was not expecting such an intense reaction. Anyway I thought it was quite funny and I can't wait to try this again in other restaurants.I had the grilled octopus which was amazing and my wife had the lamb souvlaki which she said was the best lamb she's ever had. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service: 4 stars overall. We'll be back if we're in the area, and we'll order tap water again."
4,"Finaly we decided to drop by this tiny restaurant which we are passing almost every day while we cycle to our work. I must say all the time I had bad opinion about this restaurant, judging by outside look, but once we entered in I immediately recognized that I was wrong. It had pleasant atmosphere with nice smells and welcoming staff (I guess owners). From first view on menu I could feel that here they have good food. I ordered pasta pesto while my wife had some type of fruit soup. It was really delicious and my pasta was even better than in Vapiano, for which I was thinking is far Nr. 1 in Hamburg. I can only say that Sagners is coming on our short list of local restaurant where we are going for lunch breaks."
4,We were staying nearby so decided to try it out. We liked it so much that we ended up coming here consistently our entire short stay in Hamburg. Staff is incredibly friendly and the space is minimally but very nicely designed. I tried both the cappuccino and flat white and preferred the cappuccino. The carrot cake is the best I've ever had. Ever. The cake itself is rich and not sweet with a wonderful texture and the frosting is buttery and delicious. Perfect! Will return the next time I find myself in Hamburg.
3,"I like to eat lunch here on Mondays and Fridays. Mondays, they usually have noodles, on Fridays, they have fish for today's lunch menu."
2,"Wow, I am glad I didn't pay 25.50 EUROS for this. Online prices are much cheaper. It's fun and has some local Hamburg history tied in which is cool and cruel. The fear and frightening factor is not as severe as I had expected but it's definitely well advised that kids under 10 aren't allowed (allusions to castration as a means of torture) and those 10-14 only with an adult. I saw the German show and much of its wording seemed to be directly translated from English - just didn't sound that natural in German. The acting was pretty good but I didn't like that you had to go through the entire thing with a rather large group of people. It's tight in some of the rooms and you don't have a chance to see everything because it's so crowded. Although it would be a lot more fun if you were allowed to take pictures or they would at least include the initial photo that they take in the entry price. Didn't feel like paying another 10 Euros for it."
3,"been here several times, usually pretty early in the afternoon. it's a small place, & there are only ever 1 or 2 people working at a time. thus the service can be pretty slow; however, i find that the croques are worth it. i always get the antipasti croque, it's amazing, and also big enough that i take half home & get a second meal out of it (your mileage may vary). try dining in the quiet little garden out back if the weather's nice."
4,Great place to it with a very affordable price. I think they recently change their chef which now is not as good as it used to be but is still okay
4,"The perfect place to have an original Indian meal. It takes you to the middle of India!Der beste Ort, an dem man ein kleines Stück Indiens erleben kann! Wirklich indisch!"
4,"Wonderful cafe for breakfast, desserts or fancy coffee drinks. The warm crumble with ice cream was a special favorite. It has a very warm and cozy atmosphere."
3,This is a nice plate for a quick bite to eat. You can feel a bit rushed when it's crowded with several people waiting in line. The food is pretty good and healthy . I usually get a salad or sandwich which is prepared for everyday consumption. Most of the items in the fridge have dates on it so you'll know when it was lasted prepared for eating.
1,The food was great but really poor service and a very rude waiter. My first time there was great but the second time i had to wait for long until i was offered to seat and the waiter was very unfriendly. He threw my Atm card at me instead of just handing back politely. I will always go back and i look forward to better service.
0,"The food was delicious but the service was absolutely terrible. We came in at 5pm and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant, so understaffing was definitely not an issue as we saw many other customers (including the table next to us who came in after us) catered to in a timely matter. First off, they took an incredibly long time to get back to us (~15 mins) so we had to ask the waiter for the menu, to take our order and for the desert menu. The only thing we didn't have to wait 15 minutes then ask for was the water that they initially served us. The final straw for us was dessert. Not only did we have to ask for the desert menu after waiting around 15 minutes for someone to take our plates away, we also had waited around 20 minutes for someone to come take our order for dessert, at which point we both gave up on this horrendous service and decided to just pay and leave. We waited around 5 more minutes to see if anyone would acknowledge us, and to no surprise, no one had came over. We had to walk to the cashier to pay. The whole meal took almost one and a half hours and we only ordered one main course each since we gave up on dessert. I honestly think the Currywurst Kiosk on the Reeperbahn has better service.‍"
4,"We (Dave) has been looking for his ""holy grail"" of Restaurants in every country! This was it for Hamburg! The service, food and ambience was all 5 stars! They don't have an English menu, so the very patient server walked us through the whole thing then recommended an amazing French wine that complimented the meal perfectly! If in Hamburg, this is a must try! The menu has something for everyone! Vegetarian and carnivore! It's considered modern European and it does not disappoint!"
3,"There's only one problem with this bar - it's slightly odd location. Otherwise it's cool, has loads of nice sofas and it's pretty damn cheap with hefe at 2.70eu."
4,"After trying few different flammkuchen in Hamburg, I would say this is the best in town. It's a cosy place, located in a hidden corner near Schlump station. The staff is very friendly, they gave me explanations and some good recommendations . We tried flammkuchens with dates and with salmon. Both tastes awesome. The crust is thin and crispy. Topping combinations are good. A warm Jimmy herbal tea is healthy and tasty. For dessert, we tried Creme Brûlée which is only available in winter. It was not bad but there is still some rooms for improvement."
2,"Finally managed to come here a couple of times. It's the after-work place for drinks if you are in town. We showed up once and it was empty. By the time we left, an hour later, it was packed, both inside and outside. The bartendars are pretty cool and seem to remember you if you've come in more than once. The guy I was having drinks with knew them pretty well and service was promt with good mixing. I simply don't like the location as it's pretty poorly placed and hence also small. Also a bit of a weird crowd tends to show up hence it's a bit hit or miss on whom you meet here. The two times I was there it definitely tended also towards a sausage fest hence ladies, perfect for you. Not necessarily a singles bar as it was originally described to me. I thought this would be an interesting aspect but it never really panned out this way. Drink prices are good though during happy hour so I'd recommend trying it out."
0,"OrderedAManhattan-Saturday night, trendy spot, was not very full. Service was quick and nice, but the Manhattan didn't taste like a Manhattan. Tasted more like cough syrup. My boyfriend a Cuba Libre. Also didn't taste like a Cuba Libre. We finished the drinks and quickly set off to find a better bar."
3,I don't know much about Vietnamese food and how it is supposed to taste. But I can tell you that this restaurant offers tasty food in a relaxed atmosphere. The staff is friendly even though sometimes a bit odd (not in a rude way).
4,"There are a lot of reviews, they all praise it. So do we. Enjoyed it, must go if you go to Hamburg. I would say it should be the reason for you to go to Hamburg, and you can also see other stuff in town.Service is top, WIFI is top, if you can arrange it go in November, January and February (as they guide told us), and during the week.Sunday it is always full and then you can have three rows in front of you. So if you can arrange it, come off-peak.Additionally book online upfront, so you don't have to wait."
0,"Sub-par food at high prices, snobby owners more interested in joking around than dealing with the customers queuing. To me, this is another one of the many operations riding the vegan trend for maximum cash and giving the vegan movement a bad rep."
4,"Gaaaanz lecker und preiswert!!!! Ich stimme zu was die anderen geschrieben haben. Wer Kartoffeln essen will, geh einfach ein da man viel drauf auswahlen kann :-)"
4,"This place is the shiznet! It's loungy and bar-like, yet good enough to bring your kids along. We did indeed bring our boys here. The waitress/bartender was awesome and spoke very English very well.  Th food - Turkish style middle eastern was great. Kids had a burger and falafel. Wife and I had Doner(Gyro basically). All that and drinks for the kids and 5 drinks for us(yeah kids drove ya crazy today - don't judge) - $55 Euros. I overtipped the waitress because the kids were being little twerps, over tired from a long day. She really did a fantastic job though."
4,A very friendly and welcoming place with a good menu that can always be adapted. Neo and the team will always look after you.
0,"DON'T GO TO SCHWEINSKE, DON'T GO TO ANY OF SCHWEINSKE'S RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!WHY?It's not that I've experienced bad service or had a fight with some waiter, it's just bad because the food is horrible.Why would someone pay 20 times more then you could buy the same food in supermarkets and heat it up in the microwave? Well that's is actually what Schwinske does.NOTHING IS FRESH. N O T H I N G.And I think someone who ownes such a chain and serve such bad food for that price, that person must be evil haha. I'm serious.IT'S A RIP OFF.I saw many times how they prepare the food. They just take it out form cans and/or defrost something.And the breakfast offer is just  H O R R I B L E. Haha Do yourself a favor, be a little classy and spend a little more time, but the same money for some better restaurants to eat. Heeeyyyy that's why we have YELP :D"
4,This was such an eye opening experience. I would recommend everyone to give this museum a chance and let it show you a different world.
4,another treasure in the industrial West side on the way to the football stadium. great north German fare. try the rotbarsch filet. the bratkartoffeln is a bit too oily for my taste. also the fish soup! lots of chunky fish pieces and shrimps. wholesome food for the soul. lecker!
4,"This Miniatur-Wunderland is the biggest model museum in the world (in the Guinness Book of Records). They have various model constructions from Germany to USA.  There is so many houses, automobiles etc that make up the areas with most of the model villages/areas with moving elements from people to automobiles. Throughout time at the museum the lights will dim to give you a glance of how the model village looks like at night as well as during the day.  The night scenes are as spectacular as of the lights that come on in the houses, etc.  I highly recommend to anyone and don't forget to press the buttons to make some of the moving elements move.  Highly recommend to anyone that loves trains and models that move and light up."
0,"Sorry to have to give this restaurant one star.  Ate there for lunch twice, one week apart, in July 2017.  First lunch visit I ordered the vegetarian lunch menu.  The taste of the food was fine but an hour later I was running to the toilet.  i thought, things happen, something I ate didn't agree with me.I went back exactly a week later and this time I ordered the Chicken lunch menu.  Same thing happened.I will not be going back.  Sorry."
3,"Delicious burritos! Oh my goodness so good!As a Californian it is extremely difficult to find decent (let alone authentic) Mexican food in Germany but this place did it. I mean, who knew you could find nopales in Germany? Extra nice touch with the small religious shrine behind the counter and Mexican wrestler wall paper, it was like stepping into a burrito shop in San Diego.The beans, the rice, the pico de gallo, perfect.Not giving the full 5 stars because it is a small space where people tend to linger long past the end of their meal making finding a seat (or waiting for one) a hassle. Much, much better than Dolores in Berlin. Still, I'd come back here ASAP!"
4,"Probably my favourite cafe in Hamburg. Outstanding coffee, roasted in-house and prepared with skill and love. The food is super tasty and creative. Out back there's a great view over one of the canals and the interior is very stylish. Top recommendation for specialty coffee lovers."
2,"Once upon a time their burgers and sweet potato fries were amazing. Now they serve you ketchup in a tiny paper cup, you drink your lemonade from an IKEA glass (used to be jars) and their sweet potato fries don't taste as good anymore. Burgers itself are good for the price offered on the lunch menu. Staff seems to change frequently, though they are always friendly."
2,"""Otto's'"" seem to be the only place in Hamburg currently serving ""Beyond Meat"" (The Impossible Burger, a competitor, isn't being served anywhere), vegetarian patties supposedly closely resembling meat texture and flavor.This is why I came here.Didn't enjoy Otto's ambiance too much: flickering neon lights, cold tiles, carefully run-down walls, bathrooms in a dark cellar ... all horror flick style. Most seats are hard and don't have backrests. Not cheap either (although, Germany take note, water ... is free and proactively offered.)- Drum roll -  my verdict on the Beyond Meat burger.The pessimist's take:This is, clearly, not beef. Too soft, and I can tell that this is not meat. If Beyond Meat is at version 1, wait for version 5.Mind you, I knew I was not having meat.So the optimist's take:I think that 95% of people would *not* have complained had they thought they'd be served a super-tender special-seasoning beef burger. Given that the burger's sauces and other flavors overlay much else, it would work. And it was not bad, better than any vegetarian burger I ever had.I am a carnivore, but hope that one day food like this can replace much of the cruelty of today's food chain. What a sad irony that this plant burger alternative currently costs 50% more than conventional beef.(Note: the 3*** rating isn't for this rather peculiar burger, but for place, ambiance, and its price-experience ratio in general.)"
1,"I definitely see the appeal here. I feel like it's more for the masses...think McDonald's, German style. And actually the burgers and fries do very much taste similar to that of McDonald's, in my opinion anyway. Even the advertising is in line with that of McDonald's as they advertise huge massive burgers, but in reality you get a thin, perfectly cylindrical and over-seasoned hamburger patty, flat mass-produced buns and misc. toppings...but at least it tastes pretty good. Again...think McDonald's but at twice or three times the price wherever you come from.If you are a visitor of Hamburg, please do not believe those that say it's the best in our city! There are many more better offerings in Hamburg.  Overall, 2.5 stars. Will you ever see me there again? Not if it's my choice. I won't deny that I thought it was pretty good, but I was disappointed overall. If anything really, it has seriously deterred me from wanting to try Block House."
4,"I seriously can't believe that I forgot to review Gloria. Busy busy I guess. Anyway I've been a few times for their Sunday brunch buffet. It's not cheap at EUR13, but boy is it good! Check out the photos..."
2,"The 20 UP is located in a Hotel in the St Pauli district. It is of course known for its breathtaking views of the city. However that is about it. The service is horrible, the drinks are watered down, and it is rather small. And because it has become even more popular with tourist so it is filled to the brim with them.In my opinion, go there once, keep your coat on, walk over to the window, take a few pictures and enjoy the view and then get the hell out of there. You'll thank me later."
4,"Some weeks ago, we noticed that this Vietnamese restaurants is full of people and tried it ourselves  result: best in town! Since my last trip to Vietnam, I haven't had such good soup noodles (Pho) which becomes even more tasty the colder it gets outside. The summer role and dry noodles (Bun) are also very authentic. Besides, they offer a few different dishes every week as well as some interest drinks. Price-wise: EUR 6,50 for a full bowl of noodles  very reasonable! The team is friendly and in very good control of the full house (people often cue outside but the food doesn't take long at all). We are now a frequent visitor at this place and look forward for next quick fix between shopping or after work."
4,"A 5-star Flat White was what I was after...And a 5-star Flat White is what I got. An esteemed colleague of mine suggest Public Coffee Roasters as a (much needed) departure from chains Starbucks, Balzac, etc. She was undeniably correct, Public Coffee Roasters was a nice walk for us (fresh air!) and ended up being lovely (fresh coffee!). The guy behind the counter was very courteous and made that flat white with an expert touch. Upon delivering it to our table he even apologized for the (nonexistent!) delay. It's a chill spot with a few tables, comfortable vibe, nice music, friendly staff and great coffee. Hits all the notes for me."
2,"My UK colleague and I were seeking a late night seafood dinner around 10pm.  A woman in her late 20s recommended this Portuguese seafood restaurant, Gaststätte La Sepia in Sternschanze.  As we were in the city center, we took the S-Bahn to the Sternschanze and walked 5 mins to the restaurant.  The restaurant was relatively emply, so we were seated immediately.  I ordered a mixed grill fish platter, which included five types of fish, served with tartar sauce.  It was delicious and tasted fresh.  Some other reviews reported cockroaches in the fridge containing the fresh fish and being served moldy lemons with their fish. I wouldn't have visited the restaurant if I had read these reviews beforehand, but having been there, I can report the food was delicious, although I can't vouch for the hygiene!"
2,"Ciu bar has a lovely location next to the Alster, and it's nicely decorated and serves good drinks, but it's not my kind of bar. It's relatively expensive. It's a bit too shiny. All the customers there look like they earn much more than me and are happy to flaunt it. Yeah, it's just not my kind of place on first impressions. Maybe I'll give it a second chance sometime though."
2,"Simple beach joint. Relatively young crowd. The prices are ok, considering they really fill your white wine glass. A bit too uptight with the timing of the orders. We wanted to order fries but had to wait 8 minutes because they don't accept the order earlier than 12:30... nice and relaxing atmosphere. Just too bad the waitresses ignored us when we tried ordering drinks. The wines are ok-ish... waited too long for fries... overall we give it 3*..."
3,"If you have ever been to a Sausalitos Bar before this one will not really be any different, excpet it is much bigger than any other I have been to before. It has a huge first floor and a smaller second floor. The cocktails happy hour is every day. You get a Jumbe cocktail for the price of a regular. The food is great especially if you are a mexican food lover. It is located in the Chille house which is in the back of the Moenkenbergstrasse. Every thursday they organize afterwork parties very very nice.cheers"
4,So good... one of the best Mexican restaurants in Hamburg! Delicious food and welcoming service.
3,"Surprisingly good food. Don't expect any kind of fine dining and the area is horrible outside the door.....it's gentrifying but still a good ways away from being hip. Nevertheless, the food is solid and tasty. Service is quite fast as well and by the amount of people coming in here, you can tell that you are not the first to find this restaurant. Also, the tin serving trays will remind you of prison food. We got a kick out of this but I am sure some people will be put off. Cleanliness is also not necessarily their forte. Note, I don't mean to say the place is dirty or unsanitary. It's simply not polished but in my opinion, that's fine. As long as the food is good, you don't worry about it being unfresh and the prices are fair, a great lunch spot. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to get here and there are other good Indian places in the area as well. If you live or work nearby as I do, definitely hit this place up. It's worth it."
4,"My husband and I had such an amazing meal here a few nights ago. We are big fans of Lebanese food and this place took the cuisine to a totally new place for us. The staff was friendly and nice as could be...so very welcoming! And the food!!!! Best falafel ever! Delicous assortment of mezze, each one looked and tasted so yummy. My eggplant main was the dish of my dreams and my husband had the duck with fig carpaccio and loved all of the different flavors, especially the cinnamon rice with roasted cashews on the side. Were the shotglasses filled with chilled anise flavoured liquor terrific? Yes indeed! Was the mint sorbet and the panna cotta the best way to end a fantastic meal? Absolutely!"
4,Fantastic fantastic fantastic place to see for kids of all ages. We have been 3 times now and every time we discover something new. Italy is still under construction and I can't wait to come back next year to see it completed!!! It's a don't miss when you are in Hamburg!!!
4,"Always wanted to meet Audrey Tautou? Me too, that's why I spend all of my free time loitering around this particular photo booth. It's of the type that uses intensely bright flash, bubbling chemicals, and only prints in black and white - yielding a hilarious result which means you'll be laughing by the third shot, and therefore get something you like! Compare this to the lifeless, soulless, trashy photo-me monopoly in the UK, with an annoying computer woman patronising you into looking stupid, and you'll be glad you came to Germany. I never did meet Amelie, but I will."
4,"This is by far the best lamb/chicken/kebab I had. Authentic place with shisha space, live music and delicious food. I recommend the grilled meat for 2/3 to share."
2,"Cute small coffee shop in EimsbuettelThe Speisekammer is a cute place to enjoy breakfast in the morning or a slice of cake in the afternoon.During nice weather you can watch pedestrians from their small patio or if it is too cold or rainy relax behind their large window front or upstairs where they also have a small kids corner.The cake is fantastic, the service a little slow. However, if you are not in a rush it is a good coffee shop to spend some time.+ delicious cake+ good coffee - slow service (bring some time and patience)Credit cards accepted."
4,Simply stated- the best service in Hamburg. Always a friendly and accommodating staff and the food is consistently very good.

3,"Nice museum with art from the 16th century and onwards. Logically displayed so it was easy to follow how art forms has developed through different eras. Nice to look at paintings from Degas, Monet, Renoir, Picasso  to modern artists. Close to Hauptbahnhof so easy to get to."
4,"The food is very good and the price cannot be beaten! The plates are huge, so don't order a big starter. If you do, I wouldn't choose the nachos, they literally just put them on a plate and fill three different package-sauces in bowls... meh.I ordered a tiramisu after my big ""Schnitzel-Burger"" with fries and even that was huuuge! And delicious as well! ;)Crowded literally everyday at everytime! No matter if you wanna have breakfast, lunch or diner! So the sound level is really high and you have to speak loudly to your counterpart.But it's definitely worth to wait a short time to get a free seat. Reservations aren't possible, it's a typical ""Kneipe"", but a really good one!"
3,"The Parlament is located underneath the Rathaus. It is very beautiful with a nice mix of new and old. The menu offers German specialties: fish and meat. Our waitress was nice, but the drinks took long to be served. Enjoy"
4,"Startlingly good French food, right in the center of Hamburg.  Stopped in here a few weeks back with some coworkers, and quickly settled on the Menu (prix fix).  The appetizer was an easy choice --- the house-made pâtés (""Duo von hausgemachter Pastete"") included both a rough-ground one and a chunkier country-style version.I was thrilled with my chicken special --- rich, savory, and completely unlike your average American chicken dish.  Excellent potatoes rounded out the skillet of deliciousness.  One of my companions was underwhelmed by the rockfish (""Steinbeißer"") catch of the day.Dessert was again an easy choice; the ""Crêpe ""normande"" mit Calvados"" (apple crêpe with apple brandy) was delicious, if twice the size I needed.Wine choice was as extensive as you'd expect from a good French place, with a reasonable by-the-glass selection.Definitely a must-try for a nice meal out in Hamburg.  The waiter was comfortable in German and French, but less so in English."
1,"Limited menu (5 main course besides burgers) but at least they had an English version! Ordered the burrata, which at 18.5€ was pricey but that's because it is about three times normal size. Sadly, it lacked flavor and didn't have the soft, buttery consistency I was hoping for. Also ordered a burger with melted onions. Came so full of creamy sauce it was dripping. Had to scrape a ton of extra mayo sauce off to be edible. Tasted ok, but not worth the trouble. Also, don't say yes when they all you if you want one dish before another... They won't put in the order for your second until your first is gone (even if it's a huge barrata big enough for 4 people). Sat awkwardly waiting for my burger for over half an hour before she asked if I finally wanted it... Uhgg. This place was meh, and I wouldn't return."
4,"Excellent food, service, and ambiance. The price went up to 6.50 EUR, but the generous portions and quality of food is still the same. I hope the restaurant realizes that students and tourists on a tight budget rely on this place to continue offering great service and delicious meals for a reasonable price."
4,great food. something a bit different. nice staff too.
2,i guess i should try it again.. first time wasn't really that good. not like something was bad  that borshch is just not for my taste
4,"What an awesome spot to sit and have a meal or just a drink or coffee/water on a nice day! An especially great spot to stop if you're cycling around the lake. Good prices, decent food, friendly service, but most of all the vibe can't be beat. Totally cool to be out there on the water. Like hanging out on a boat without the rocking. Clean bathrooms, too!"
3,"This place is crazy. So many details and special effects. If you like trains, building stuff, or if you have a kid this is the place. It was a little to crowded for me. Many kids and parents. They have minimiced citys over the world and they make it possible for you to see theese in daylight but also at night. This place is big so make sure you have time to go trough all rooms. They serve food and theres toilets. Costs 16 euro per person in entrence fee for adults. There are parkingspots near and a parking house."
3,"Good and cheap restaurant  in Altona, near the beach. They serve sausages with bread and potatoes salad, and other traditional German fast-food. We were sitting at a table which was just in the way between the stairs and the beach, so there was a lot of passing."
2,"ahhh roschinskys. I have ended many a night in here, and always wondered, well, why? Its exactly the same as every other bar long the street. It has the same people (are they cardboard cut-outs?) it even has the same drinks and the same bar staff. Not really original in my eyes and nothing special to write home about. The people are friendly enough, the crowd is youngish and the music is ok. nothing out of the ordinary, and too crowded late at night for my tastes."
4,"Oh my god ! First you walk in and you see this cute guy with amazing eyes and a big warm smile behnd the counter. He makes you the best coffee ever and gives you a slice of cheesecake. You are in heaven.Then comes the dilema. what do you do ?Try and pick up the cute guy ?Take home the cheesecake ? Well, I'm sorry to say cute guy, but I think it's going to have to be the cheesecake. I'm sure you taste good too, but the cheesecake definately tastes better."
4,"Great food! Great service! Modern and stylish interiorising, and good quality restrooms. (Large portions)"
3,"The place is quite neat and spacious, for such times the seating is very well spread out. Food is mostly good. Got a bunch of dimsums with jasmine tea. Had a few types of shrimp dumplings and rice-rolls, totally recommend. The xiao long bao is a let down though, no broth just the minced pork. And the egg tarts were also okay-ish. We got there at 20:15 and their kitchen closes at 21:00. The waitress was constantly on our back to order and kept reaching for our order sheet (you write your order on a notepad they give you). We had to rush eventually amd write a bunch of numbers for our order."
3,"Great buffet, can't wait to go again. Plan to workout after binge-eating on the delicious but oily biryani!"
4,"I was lucky to get to visit the Exhibition 'Mahjong;' in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. This was an extensive exhibition that was curated with the highest calibre. The exhaustative exhibition told truths about China from approximately 1979 to 2005 through the work of many chinese artists. On entering this exhibition the first piece reduced me to tears and of course frightened my pal who ran off to hide in the toilets. The piece featured a giant sized wallet that framed video footage of the production of wallets in sweatshops, slaughter houses and high street designer stores. The video footage was also complimented by very sad violin music. The rest of the exhibition was a weeks worth of viewing, and expressive pieces that told us truths about China. We were educated with hard hitting expressive modern peices. The final pieces I viewed were some Mao propoganda graphics. I think this exhibition at the Hamburger Kunsthalle was one of the most outstanding of exhibitions I ever visited and i would of course always be interested to know what goes on in the Kunsthalle."
3,"I'm from Italy, Rome and I can say that you can find good real italian food here. It might be the only or one of the few place in Hamburg.Good prices and italian speaking staff. Good if you want to have a real italian restaurant experience :)"
3,"Mmmm, burritos! Big, filling, yummy, vegan and vegetarian burritos (they have beef/poultry too but I've never had one of those).It might not be the best burritos in the world, but they get the job done. :)The wait is always long, but the beers are always cold so who cares? We return every time we're in Hamburg, sometimes twice in a day..."
4,"Bleeuggh. I was clearly here, since my phone checked me in and I have photos to prove it. However having followed the crowds down at 5.30 am following all night Chelsea-beating-Bayern revelry I don't remember much about it!What I DO remember though was Queen Mary 2 gliding by at 6am plus being saved by about a pint of hot cappuccino poured into me an hour later. So many people there for the Fischmarket  thousands were there even at sunrise on Sunday!"
4,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here during our stay in Hamburg and I can safely say it was the best meal of my life. Armando was incredibly friendly and accommodating (since I'm a vegetarian.) Each of the four courses was better than the last, and the wine pairing was excellent. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys food. Wonderful, wonderful experience!"
2,"A nice atmosphere, with running sushi, was kinda full, but still good sushi."
2,"We ordered number 25 and 32. The sauce of number 25 was good and the nuggets were ok, but for 11 € it's overpriced and not worth it. The 32 dish was ok. When to skip this place: 1) If you are asian and used to asian food, skip this place. It's a classy germanized asian food 2) This might sound like the loving hut chain you think you know from the US. It's not! None of the dishes are the same. Just the name and logo looks the same 3) the service is not about making you feel welcomed or comfortable. It's about making sure you get your food lol. Feels very chaotic and rushed. Would I come again. Nope. Do I regret coming here. Nope, it's good to know that loving hut doesn't equal loving hut. It's not like McDonald's where you can expect to be able to order a Big Mac."
3,"Update: So after now having been here a bunch of times, I remembered to come back and update this review. i almost forgot to do so but steak places have a special place in my heart. Long-story short, the place has come into its own. It's still a bit generic, hence only four instead of five stars. There is a bunch of new waitstaff so I guess they dumped people who were not up to par and have finally found people who'll stick around for a bit. We had great service again so happy on that front. I've basically only been here with guy friends (my g/f is just not into it) and everyone is always pleasantly surprised. Best bet is to come here when you want good food, are with a group and know everyone is going to drink. The outdoor area is as expected fun so definitely an option for outdoor seating. Food has remained consistent and really good. I know a bunch of people who've complained about things here but they must just hit my sense of taste. I always like the burgers, find the fries really good and the steaks with spinach are the best. This place remains an indulgence for every couple months and I'm glad they came to Hamburg. It seems like they'll stick around for a bit. With a heavy heart I am only going to give The Bird three stars at this point. I've often been to their location in Berlin and really am a big fan. The combination of great steaks and burgers, with a bit of a rockabilly atmosphere mixed in with attitude and grunginess familiar to Berlin excel at that location. I awaited patiently the opening of the Hamburg location which I received the scoop on pretty early (someone knew someone and so forth!) Anyway, the 30th of April opening night was in my calendar real early. So we went and unfortunately had too high an expectation. Don't get me wrong. The food is just as it is in Berlin. You either like it or you don't. I like it and the burgers in my opinion are awesome and the steaks are always exemplary and consistent (although I only had a burger last night......steak next time!)So why only the three stars? Well it could be because it was opening night and we will be back, so take these three stars as only preliminary for me. Anyway, some things were just off. The restaurant itself isn't ""done"". There's no real deco on the walls and it's too ""clean"". Actually with the funny painting/light ceiling thing in the middle of the restaurant area it looks like a Turkish bath renovated into a cheap Italian restaurant. Did they not get some kind of interior designer involved in this process? The lighting is off too. Granted, some lights were obviously broken but the lighting is crap. Screw the modern stuff.....throw some candles on the tables and make it a bit more intimate/moody/whatever. With the fluorescent ceiling fixtures, it's just wrong. The tables are too new and modern. Why didn't they just go out and buy up a bunch of old, beaten up benches or tables from an insolvency sale. There is so much more character in something like that and more so than this Ikea style suburban dining set set-up they have. Somehow this all has to ""age"" and get a bit beaten up before I'll truly accept it. We'll see how time changes this place and I hope they ""finish"" decorating because right now it seems clearly unfinished.Staff were super nice. We had the Brazilian guy and two girls (everyone speaks better English than German.....as in the Berlin location) and the girls all have tats. Anyway, super nice but not yet up to speed. You have to get them informed of how things were in Berlin. Your regulars are going to come expecting what they know from Berlin. Brazilian guy was almost too nice if you know what I mean. But, to counteract that, the one tattooed girl was super nice but smelled of sweat. I guess that balances things out. :-) At least someone was a bit ""grungy.On a positive note, after we finished eating we were offered shots with our bill. The crowd was a bit edgy (wonder if it stays like this). The dog from Berlin was wandering around the place which adds charm. The outdoor benches will be awesome in the summer months, just like sitting out front in Berlin is. There is a ton of potential here. I may be over critical and it was their first night but I'm willing to wait it out. I'll definitely be back and also with a group of guys instead of the missus. This is more of a place to go with a group of friends, throw back some meat and empty a couple pitchers. Not a date-night place so do keep that in mind.Long story short, I hope this isn't the American owners getting older and settled and reflecting that in their new Hamburg place. Stay true to who you were, grunge up the place a bit and make it the relaxed, rocker-edge hang-out with great food and drink that it wants to be."
1,"If you speak English or not that much German and have any needs that you want to communicate, this might not be the place. The staff did not understand what we asked for when saying ""keine Milch"", which should be pretty self explanatory.. They also forgot to give us our drinks. Food (when we finally managed to make an order) was good, though."
2,"My colleagues in our Hamburg office wanted Asian food delivered during our working lunch.  Being from San Francisco, again, I was hesitant with Asian food in Germany.  Also, Bok is an eclectic Asian restaurant, serving sushi, Thai food, and some hints of Chinese food.  I played it safe and went with the fried tofu with veggies.  Honestly, the fried tofu and veggies weren't bad at all.  Delicate pieces of fried tofu with fresh assorted veggies and a light gravy.  I had a bite of my colleague's fried chicken and it was enjoyable as well.  It came with a side of a sweet sauce, but I didn't use any of the sweet sauce.  If you're craving for Asian food in Hamburg, Bok isn't a bad choice."
1,"It is what it is. It's an easy spot, but the food isn't stellar. It's affordable but tastes like so so delivery food."
4,"This is not my first time to visit them, but a first on a weekend. The service is still very good & it all arrive on a timely manner inspite being full house. They have a nice selection of drinks for both alcoholic & non-alcoholic drinker. Definitely will go back !!"
4,"Super! It is my Wednesday tradition now. I always order No 25, Klein gemuseteller mit Dönner . Sorry about the spelling. I tried my best. Sometimes I tried No 38 and something on the special. The food is good and worth its price."
2,"Maybe I just dreamt that I already reviewed here. Decent location in a nice square by the canal, and popular. The downside is the sometimes painfully slow service, and I've never been overwhelmed by the pasta. I would recommend Rialto, which is just next door. It is stylish though."
2,An OK version of an Aussie bar where you can drink VB and Fosters. The food is quite good: wings are the house speciality in many many sauces  not typically Australian but good. A bit out of town but walkable from Dammtor station.
3,"A nice place for a decent dinner that does not kill off your retirement account. The pizza's are thin crust and huge (definitely large enough for two hearty eaters. The salads are also nice, and on a nice summer evening their outdoor seating is very nice. Enjoy!"
3,"I tried the palak paneer combo that was available at lunch. Overall, I was satisfied with the meal and had a nice siesta. The combo comes with yoghurt, black lentils, spinach paneer, zeera rice, salad and naan. What I did not like was that the portions for yoghurt and lentils were pathetic. So I find it funny that the black lentils was either too bland or too small a portion to even get a proper taste. Restaurant itself is, obviously, too small and may not appear too hygienic to certain folks. Based on my conversations with the locals including Indians, the place offers authentic Indian food and sweets are also a specialty here."
3,"This place is absolutely delish!! Im very picky w buffet restaurants.. this place has ""superb"" quality meats, fish, and veggies. They have to roll us out of here eventually  btw the restaurant is huge and interior design is modern and white. Very nice!"
1,Delicious food!!!Funky atmosphere!!!The entire experience was ruined by the waiter attempting to flirt with my boyfriend the whole time!!!
1,"Zoo OK, Service Katastrophe Bei dem Eintrittspreis und den vielen Extrakosten könnte man wenigstens für einigermaßen freundliches Personal sorgen. Wird aber leider nicht gemacht. Ob Crepe, Ponyreiten, besonders in der Flamingo Lounge: Wir wurden sehr unfreundlich behandelt. Das Foto zeigt einen Wurm im Bierglas, es gab ein Neues, aber keine Entschuldigung. Am Besten also selbst versorgen und sich nur auf die vielen Tiere konzentrieren."
3,Went there for dinner. Pretty good sushi. Probably one of the best places in town to get sushi. Nice atmosphere.
3,"My colleague and I were both craving some schnitzel and a good beer. As luck would have it, this place was a short walk from our hotel and it did not disappoint.The Location - Directly along one of the canals, the side of the dining room with large windows serves as a great spot to take in the sights. Get there early if you want a window seat, however, as the room fills up quickly as the night goes on.The Beer - Solid micro brews, most of which are made in the German style. The Pilsner was light and refreshing, and the Hefeweizen was fruity and tasty. It was fun to see onsite brewing urns and various ingredients and equipment as you walk through the place.The Food - The schnitzel did not disappoint. Served in various styles and accompanied by various preparations of potatoes and other veggies, I'd easily go back if my next schnitzel craving hits while in Hamburg.The Service - Not spectacular, but they did their job. Not much personality to speak of. The food came, the beer came, and the empties disappeared. Worked for us."
0,Food is bland and service was worst. Very rude servers (young and old)!!! They all seemed pissed off that there's people in the restaurant! Never-ever again even if I'm starving and it's next to the hotel!
3,"Gotta have a hamburger in Hamburg! We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar without a reservation and the place was absolutely packed the whole time. Heed the warning in the menu: this burger truly takes its damn time. We waited almost AN HOUR to receive food after ordering. Strangely, other people sitting at the bar got their food at the same time even though they arrived 30 minutes after us. That's the only reason the Bird doesn't get 5 stars. However, the servers were nice and the beers are big and they serve decent cider as well, so that took up our time. When we actually got the burger, I was ravenous. I'm happy to say that it was delicious and juicy and the HUGE medium rare patty was more like rare; very pink inside! I was in meaty bliss for the next 20 minutes. I opted for the Ghetto Deluxe with an egg and was about to order fries as well but our server kindly stopped me, bringing my attention to the fact that each burger comes with fries. And it is a lot of fries! They are crispy outside and creamy inside. And I was skeptical about using an english muffin for a bun but it worked out very well; keeping the burger structurally intact while soaking up all the yolk and meatjuice in the nooks and crannies. Also appreciated is the fact that they put the condiments right in front of you, and they have Tapatio! I don't like it when restaurants give me a tiny container of ketchup with my food.. I know it is a stereotype that Americans love ketchup but I'm afraid I have to propagate it; give me my damn ketchup. This is an excellent burger; one of the better ones that I've had the pleasure of eating in my lifetime. However, be prepared for a LONG wait and don't forget to bring cash."
4,This restaurant is amazing! The ambience is lovely. The food was so delicious!! We were there on a Saturday evening. I chose the vegi menu and it was simply superb! The cook was so kind.  He guaranteed us a gluten free menu for our little son who is a Celiac(Zöliakie). My son loved the food! He didnt have any stomachache afterwards.  The service was good even though we were in a large group and things got a bit confusing. We will definitely go there again.
3,"Great Coffee, Muffins and Soup! I have not tried their other offerings, but this small cafe is full every day at lunch and throughout the day with people picking up coffee to go. Wonderful location right at the Hallerstrasse U1 entrance, Make sure to get a frequent buyer card!"
3,"If you are looking for upperscale German dining, you'll probably like this. The food was a bit funky for us Americans, but the quality seemed very good. I had the pork steak. The flavors were delicious, but a bit rich and salty. However, I think it just may be cultural difference. The view is of course amazing. The staff was super friendly and spoke English well. That's a big plus in Hamburg. We were going to a concert and wanted to eat close by. Well worth it!"
4,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a couple months back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have the like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Now that it's getting warmer out, I'm glad they have the tables outside. It's usually packed at noon so the outdoor seating allows things to overflow to the outdoors a bit. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Today for example had the coconut mild and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
4,Nice Italian restaurant in cute neighborhood. Good service freshly made pasta and bread. Very tasty
3,"This is a Korean restaurant. Why there also happens to be sushi on the menu too is completely baffling. This is pretty obvious from how much more Korean food is on the menu than sushiI chose to go with a classic. It's hard to ever go wrong with bibimbap. Good food portion, really good sauce and an authentic bibimbap. I was pleased. I shall return to try the rest of the menu, mostly likely their bulgogi"
2,"After burgers me and my family took a vote: from 1-5, how many stars. So... 2 votes for 3 stars, 1 for 4, and since I was counting votes I got to be indecisive and go for 3,5 stars. Result is 3 stars. Best things first : meat quality seemed fine. Bun is symbolic, has to be there to give you an illusion of something else than meat overload. I got the classic burger and to me it was a bit heavy on the mustard. But otherwise real greasy like expected. And a s***load of fries. Never seen that many fries on one plate before. Actually kind of scary. A bit too much even.And then the bad: what is up with the acoustics in this place? It fills up pretty quickly after 6pm, and with the people comes the noise. And OMG we had to yell to have a conversation. It was almost impossible to hear what the others at the table said. Its ok with noise, but this was ridiculous. I would go there again if asked, but preferably with more beer and less conversation involved."
4,"The Rathaus is their city hall, but you wouldn't think so with how grand and big it is!  The architecture is truly breathtaking.  I was surprised to see that it was open on a Sunday.  My boss and I went in before closing to look around and just awe.  Apparently you can take a tour, but we didn't know this and opted for a quick ""free"" self-tour.  Loved the back area as well.It's in the heart of the city center and is worth a visit!"
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining as Ernst wrote. The food is mediocre at best. There is nothing sensational on the menu. Nor is there anything in any way memorable. All fairly standard fare. Sometimes things are good. Sometimes they are off. The place is not consistent. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow. I couldn't even tell what it was. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table."
4,"Chocolate Museum Tour is normally in German but the entire group spoke English so thank goodness the guide was able to do it in English. Made our own chocolate bars, learned about the fascinating history and process of how cocoa is produced and eventually made into the sweet sweet chocolate we know today. Worth the money! Loved learning about all of the history and procedures/stages of making chocolate."
4,"I had bad home sickness, so a friend of mine and me decided to go to this Lithuanian restaurant yesterday. Not Russian but some pretty similar meals. We've been in the ""Teigtasche"" for the first time. But I definitely want to come back again. When you enter the restaurant it already looks and feels quite snug and welcoming. The filled pastries tasted almost like the Pelmeni and Vareniki my mum and grandma's used to make in my childhood. Very delicious. They offer a huge variety of dishes and self-made liquors. I highly recommend this restaurant for all fans of East European cuisine and for those who miss the cuisine of Mam. :-D"
4,"An amazingly beautiful building from inside and out. Make sure to do the tour of the inside, it is well worth it and only cost 4 Euros! You get a bit of history and get to see the amazing rooms. Everything is original which makes the building special in Hamburg. It survived both world wars almost completely (besides for the windows) intact."
3,"We stumbled upon Thämers during a frigid, windy Sunday, and it served as an excellent port during the storm. Though we didn't try the food, the Latte Machiatto and Pharisäer were just what the doctor ordered. Looking forward to trying out the terrace when the weather improves and upgrading to 5 stars! Kann es fast empfehlen!"
3,"We found the restaurant on Yelp, of course.     We are 3 Germans, 1 Ecuadorian and 1 from the US. (Yes, it's Election Day but I voted early.).  Three of the pastas were excellent; 2 were good.  (The pumpkin ravioli was amazing.). The wine was very good-- we had red and white. The Tiramisu was excellent and the créame caramel was nice."
3,"Always busy, order and take a buzzer back to your table and wait 5 minutes. Collect your own utensils. No table service. The food is pretty good and for 6 Euros, a good deal. You could do a lot worse in the area.."
3,"Kumpir is a little gem of a place on Schanzenstr. Basically they only sell baked potatoes, and the most expensive thing on the menu is EUR3.90, and that's what I went for. A mexican-themed baked potato. It came with cheese, chicken, salsa, nachos tomatoes and jalapenos. It really hit the spot. I'll definitely be back."
4,"Really nice small café in a kind of backyard atmosphere.The staff is very friendly and seems to know something about coffee. I chose a mug of the fresh brewed filter coffee and got it served lukewarm, so the the smell had time to unfold itself. It really tasted great! The cheesecake is awesome! A dream!!!!!The interior looks nice. Simple, chic and modern. You can also buy coffee beans and brewing tools here.Definitely to recommend!"
2,"This HB location in Hamburg is not as good as the Haufbrauhaus in Munich, Berlin or Las Vegas. The food is all the same great quality however the atmosphere is not as festive as the others. We came in on a Thursday evening at about 6:45pm. We were met at the front door by two muscle bound ape security guards that seemed to intimidate customers by their presence. We, however were seated right away even though we did not have reservations. The service was good and prompt, however there was no live Bavarian music after 7pm like the others, just the football game on tv. The food and beer was good as expected, but not much fun after that."
4,"Excellent food and great service. It's in an odd location, but we came in 30 minutes prior to closing and they happily served us."
0,"The building and the menu led us to Wasserschloss.  Made a reservation.  They didn't have the reservation but they made room for us.  That's when it all went badly.  Our server forgot to bring us bread, forgot to bring us wine, forgot to check on us once, and was surprised that we wanted the check so soon.  Terrible service ruined what could have been a great night to remember.  Stay away unless you want ok food with bland memories."
4,"I came here for breakfast and it was very good. I got sunny side up eggs with toast. The egg yolks were way over done, but besides that it was very good (and the chives in the eggs were good - although they are .50 euros more). The fruit in yogurt was okay - nothing special, but the fruit itself was very good and a generous amount. The ginger tea was also interesting."
4,THE BEST SAUSAGES IN TOWN !! A MUST for visitors and locals. Ideally located for shopping and a quick snack
4,"Great place for lunch, but get here early. It gets very busy by 12pm, but it turns over very fast, so you probably won't have to wait too long.The options seem to change daily and are very fresh. There will always usually be a chicken, ground beef or vegetarian option. I've had some great chicken pho here, but I would eat anything they serve. The staff is really friendly and service is pretty fast; it's really easy to pay and leave."
4,"On my recent visit to Hamburg, I had a need for a good lunch.  Something other than a brat or a schnitzel and boy was that need fulfilled when I ventured into Luigis.   Oh boy, I had no idea that such good Italian food could be found in Germany.My first venture was simply a pizza lunch with a glass of wine.   Well that salami and mushroom pizza was one of the best I had ever experienced.   I have always held Pasquales in San Francisco to the number one pizza but now I think I have found a close competitor.  Awesome flavor and my wine glass was really like a fishbowl filled 2/3 full.   Thank you...My second venture was two days later wherein I experienced their spaghetti frutti-deMar.   OMG....OMG...done to perfection!   Very very good.   If ever I am in Hamburg again, I am going there for sure.Oh and the atmosphere is sort of eclectic and the tables are almost like shared in some areas with outdoor seating to be had as well.   Nice place!"
4,"Some weeks ago we finally went to the Deli section of the Tim Mälzers Bullerei. We ordered the Burger and some potato wedges. The staff was efficient, attentive and very pleasant (most of them good looking blond girls) and the wedges were tasty. After a long time in Australia I have to admit the burger was average, but it surely was the most healthy burger Ive eaten in a German restaurant. Tastewise I thought the sauce didnt fit the whole comipilation. Moreover we had cakes, which were massive. Apart from the burger the whole evening was great. Summing up the cost-benefit is high for Hamburgs standards."
2,it was OK. not perfect and also not bad. Decent food for a normal/high pricevolume was not good. could be better. quality was OK. Juje and Kubide both were at normal quality.
4,"Great atmosphere! Food and drinks were very good as well. 4 of us sat in the front bar area. Thumbs up for the shrimp ceaser salad, focaccia bread and potato soup. Food, 2 beers, a Moscow Mule, and wine coat around 60€. A little pricey but nothing we wouldn't pay for the cool, modern atmosphere and quality of food."
0,"Expensive for what it is: our dishes were not well cooked, the quantity served was too little and the recipies were not really ""elaborate"". My advice: do not stop by this restaurant, you'll find many more interesting ones in the same neighbourhood."
4,"Mix with the locals and treat yourself to a phenomenal casual weekday lunch or early dinner at Fischfeinkost Delikatessen des Meeres (which roughly translates to: Fischfeinkost delicacies of the sea). This place is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a foodie, you have to check it out. If you're not a foodie, you should still check it out. The reviews are super impressive and very well deserved, and popular with the locals it is. Always a great sign, right?Ok, so here's the deal: you enter the space down a few stairs from the street level. You order your dish and a drink at the counter. The place is made up of a pretty cramped connection of tiny rooms with only a few tall tables around. Some with stools. Most without. But in pleasant weather, the great majority of folks are outside on the open sidewalk umbrella-covered tables that are pretty much full of people either enjoying their food or waiting for their food. When they have a bunch of dishes ready, they put them out on the counter and ring a bell. What? No, I'm not kidding. Then a bunch of customers just swoop right in and grab their dishes. Apparently everyone is a regular and already knows the drill, but I still have no idea how people know who gets what or when that bell ring is for them or not. Just bizarre, but it certainly seems to work. These are very happy diners, for sure. Luckily for me, the counter-lady was really sweet and clued in this rather clueless American when my dish was included in which bell ringing round.I had ordered the seafood lasagna w/carpaccio. Sounded amazing, and it certainly was. OMG. Happy me! Delic!! Lovely fresh pasta and veggies in a somewhat deconstructed lasagna style with a lot of yummy broth. Somewhat soupy. Just fantastic. The other dish available that day was a swordfish with potatoes on a bed of greens. Looked amazing and appeared to be the most popular. The Chef creates the menu each day of only 1 or 2 dishes, based on the freshest ingredients available in the markets that day. Brilliant! Simple concept. Simple food. Nothing fancy. Just fantastically prepared super fresh big plates of homey food. Everyone brings out their own flatware/napkin/drink to their tables, picks up their own dish from the counter when ready, and self-busses and drops off their dirty plates when they're done. Highly highly recommended!"
2,"Touristy, of course at this location. The menus were just kind of thrown on the table and the waiter walked away. He was very busy. Music playing so softly I couldn't even make out what kind of music was playing. Quite without atmosphere, this restaurant.Food was served quickly and tasted good. The waiter didn't come to check on us at any time though.Toilets not very clean, not dirty.. Something in the kitchen he middle. Free WiFi. I think that it's a good place to have a quick bite for a fair price close to the docks. Defiantly not a romantic place for a date!"
3,"sehr lecker, leider lassen die Toiletten zu wünschenaber das essen ist super. nicht dieses Standard glutamat China essen von um der Ecke"
3,Great place for an evening stroll or a nice day in the sun. Flowers are abundant in spring and summer with well maintained grounds with plenty of places to sit. A huge playground for the kiddies is a must do if you have a little one along for the ride. Date night has an interesting opportunity with evening fountain and light shows during the summer. This city hideaway feels like its miles from everything while being minutes from most.
4,"I always thought that burgers are something you get at McDonald's or Hesburger, but that changed when I came to Hamburg. Oma's Apotheke was the place i've tried my first real burger and I still can't find a place to top that. The staff is very welcome, interior is good, the food is great! What else do you need? :)"
4,"I went there for dinner and my expectations were not only met, but highly exceeded. Locally bought food, cooked by an extremely friendly staff. I had homemade pasta, with lentils and sausage, and some salad. Everything was fresh. I highly recommend this place!"
4,"Amazing. Menu is short  - like in very good restaurants. I tried Lamb and Sea bass, both were delicious. Note: they accept only chip cards."
4,"Really great food - excellent selection, friendly service, if a little slow. Really big portions. The grill for two people was especially nice."
4,"These type of traditional places are disappearing quickly...don't miss this one. Close to the Hauptbahnhof, great for a quick meal and a beer!"
4,"An absolutely wonderful experience. I hadn't expected much and was really overwhelmed by the amount of detail in the tableaus. There really is something for all ages in the Mini Wunderland, and my whole family spent a lot of time marveling over the beautiful landscapes. I recommend booking an early time-slot; it only gets more crowded during the day. Take the guided tour and get behind the scenes. It's worth the €15!If you're head is filled up after a few hours, you can get a stamp on your hand and return later in the day. There's always more to explore!"
1,"This was an absolute disappointment. Dishes were small and mainly consisted of the cheaper ingredients.I had the grilled duck in sweet & sour. I got a dish with literally 5 small pieces of duck and a lot of tomato, pineapple, onion, bell pepper and carrot in sweet & sour sauce. My wife had green salad with peanut sauce. That was hardly enough as a starter.Value for money is definitely out of balance here.Shame"
4,"Best. Schnitzel. Ever. This was my birthday dinner, and it was perfect. The restaurant is a bar and a room for roughly 24 people. No reservations. Waiting is standing room only. But it was worth it. Very much worth it. We both ordered the Schnitzel - since we did not want to share. Their wine selection is small but very good as well. I tried a few of their whites by the glass. Portions were perfect and the room was cheery and warm.Next time I will save room for dessert."
4,Fantastic food and atmosphere. Leave enough time to get through all the yummy dishes. Probably a good idea to make a reservation!
2,"I had a nice solo lunch at this Bok! I read about it on Yelp as being a fairly decent and relaxed place for Asian food. The menu is in German and English. I had a chicken dish with yellow curry and various veggies, it came with a side of white rice. They claim it's one of the spicy dishes - I'd argue that, but, I'm from Oakland, California, where there are 10 spicy Asian restaurants within a block radius of my house - and we're spoiled. So when I come to Northern Europe and get ""spicy"" food it's often not spicy. But, it was warm and tasty and the restaurant had great music playing. I enjoyed it - I just needed something quick and warming in between work. Thanks Bok for delivering it! (And yes, too many locations in one area..very confusing :) )"
2,"I came here the other day with my man to grab dinner in the area near his office as we were running errands. This place had good reviews on yelp so we decided to check it out. The offerings on the menu were limited and were kind of pricey so we decided to try the All you can eat (AYCE) option which was 17 euros per person from 6 to 9pm. The AYCE option came with its own menu so we wrote down the # of all the sushi pieces we wanted to try. The fish selection was limited and really only the salmon tasted fresh. We tried various nigiri (only 1 pc), hand rolls, big rolls (theres only 2 roll options (one veg and one not)) and maki rolls.The tuna did not seem fresh at all and seemed like it was sitting out for awhile as it had a dark discoloration to it that I was not used to seeing and it didn't taste fresh too. The place is pretty small and fits a handful of people. The place was about half full and I think the table behind us also did the AYCE option but ordered everything off the menu so the service for our food took a lot longer then we expected. After we finally got our first round we did place and order for a couple more rolls and it seemed like it took longer then expected again as there were only 2 people making the rolls behind the counter and I believe they were making for the rolls for the larger table behind us as well as a bunch of take out orders that came in all of a sudden.All in all, the price is a good deal for AYCE sushi but the service was extremely slow and the menu options were too limited for me to be coming back here anytime soon."
4,"No doubt, the best burgers in town.After a walk around the Alster lake I decided to have a quick meal.It was about the third time I've been here. For a change I preferred the outside seating. It was a nice day...I asked for the JB Hamburger menu. It was very good, except for the potato chips that where too salty for my taste.I think this restaurant has fair prices.The WC facilities where very clean and the staff where friendly."
4,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's actually really big and cute on the inside and also has a nice patio right on the canal. If you like crepes, you really can't go wrong ordering any crepe here. We tried 2 savory crepes, both the basic one with ham, cheese, and an egg and one which also includes tomato sauce and creamy mushrooms. Seriously so good. Also the people working there are all French, so you know that it must be pretty legit"
3,"Don't get rid of the October Spacial Salad!!! It is amazing, made me come for the first time when I was in Zurich and back several times in Hamburg for it!!!"
2,"A quick and easy walk from the Miniature Wonderland, this side street cafe has a nice outdoor seating area and the service was very good. The pizza was tasty as was the spaghetti bolognese.  Not a long wait at all to get the food but the beer was kept cold and full while we did wait!"
4,"Asian vegan food. They are as good as the vegan food i used to eat in Malaysia. Service is sometimes slow but acceptable. Price is very reasonable 7.5€ for a main dish and a small bowl of soup or vegan spring rolls. We always choose soup. They change the soups quite often: mushroom soup, porridge, etc. My favorite choice is number 16."
4,"SOOOOOO good! Cheap, amazing food and friendly service!"
4,"If you're looking for good Italian food in Hamburg and you happen to be in the Speicherstadt area don't look too far. I really really like how they cook pasta, so far I've eaten here quite a few times and never been disappointed. My tips: spaghetti alla carbonara and gnocchi sardi. I should try their pizza or even salads but this is one of those restaurants where I'm just not able to try too many things because the few I've already tried are amazing. It may seem a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is high so if you keep that in mind I think prices are reasonable. Highly recommended!"
2,"Main dishes are tasty and authentic in Ni Hao restaurant! The same applies for the start but due to the small size, there are heavily overprice. Hence, better go with some friends and order a few main courses. The day we visited the restaurant, the service was not particularly attentive even though it was not much business going on. When we ordered Oolong Tea, we got served something else and after complaining they top-up another Oolong tea bag For such a good Chinese restaurant, I would expect the same for the tea: having big pots with tea leaves, reasonably priced and refills of hot water free of charge."
3,"YES, get a Hamburger in Hamburg!!Fun place, good vibe, youthful crowd. St.Pauli area of Hamburg. English widen spoken. Good music from the 70's & 80's.  HUGE 1/2 lb thick burgers, order them MEDIUM RARE 4 juicy. Tiny ""Hamburger Buns?""( more similar to English muffins....DUDE?! WTF? Soggy fries :-((( even begging first to make them well cooked, they haven't a clue how to cook FF!"
4,This was probably the best meal I ate during my two weeks in Germany! Everything was home made and there was so much attention to detail! I had spätzle with sauce and cheese and tried a dumpling with minced meat- both were outstanding! The staff were so kind and the English translated menu was perfect! I would absolutely recommend this place for an authentic German food experience!
4,"I picked out Nasch because of their phenomenal reviews on Yelp, and because my wife is vegetarian. We met up there earlier this week for lunch.The restaurant is quite small, with maybe 20 seats in the front, and another small room in the back (never actually went back there). We grabbed a couple of seats at a communal table, and although it was really tight in there, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. You order at the counter, and they bring your food to the table.I had the masamun curry with red rice, which was a huge portion (see photo) and very satisfying. It had big chunks of pumpkin, sweet potato, and eggplant, and came in a pretty spicy (in a good way) red coconut milk curry sprinkled with green onions, parsley, and peanuts. It's one of the best plates of food I've eaten in Hamburg; I was really blown away.My wife had the quiche, which, because it was vegan, she said was mostly potatoes and sweet potatoes. It was a large slice, and came with a side salad. She was also very satisfied.We split a peanut butter cookie for dessert, which I'm guessing was also vegan, but was soft and delicious like a normal (butter-laden) peanut butter cookie.I would absolutely recommend this place for a casual and hearty lunch, whether you're vegan or not. I hope to be back many times."
4,"Whenever in Germany, I always make an effort to visit the Hofbräu house.I've been to the other location here in Hamburg, but this location on Esplanade has a more authentic vibe based on the original Hofbräu Haus in Munich.Came here this time with a large group from work (in Germany for an Expo), and everyone was pleased and enjoyed the evening.Most of us ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which is my favorite.You simply must make an effort to dine here."
3,"The french name and ""Cuisine Fine"" claim makes it sound like it's a fine-dining restaurant, which it actually isn't. But it doesn't matter, because the food is actually delicious and the service is friendly.We had a little bump at the beginning where it took them almost 30min to get us the drinks, but they were apologetic enough for it, even got us a drink on the house which is very rare in German restaurants where the service is usually terrible.A 3-course menu (goat cheese salad, burger with fries and creme brulée) costs 27€ which is very fair. The drinks are also good."
4,"We had a family lunch. The place is nice and food is good and tasty. A lot of German dishes, a bit heavy on condiments but this is my personal taste as I am not originally from Germany. We had a salmon burger, two regular burgers and a fish on a potatoes bed. Nice and fast service"
3,"This is a pretty small restaurant with a bar and is only open for dinner. They serve northern german food and have day tickets posted same day, as well as a traditional menu of the same dishes offered everyday.I ordered labskaus, which is corned beef with two fried eggs, beetroot, herring, and pickles. The dish was pretty simply without complex tastes, although I really enjoyed it (this was my first time having labskaus). My family ordered veal schnitzel (served with yummy sliced potatoes and side salad) which was decent, although nothing to rave about, and pancakes, with gorgonzola cheese and tomatoes, which were thin and crepe-like. My mom was really happy with this meal as she didn't want to eat anything ""german"" or meat heavy.I enjoyed my experience and would come back here to try another simple german meal, although the meal didn't leave me ""wow'd"" and of the nature that this place deserves the extremely high 5/5 rating."
4,"Good food good service good prices. I would definitely come back when in town. Not the best of areas, but if you're close to the station, it's worth a visit."
3,"When in Sternchanze, Herr Max is one of the must-do's.Because you will want to.It's a little shop/café with homemade pastry offering a selection of freshly self-made cookies, tarts, cupcakes and cakes, each day slightly different ones. You can take it away (and buy one of their delicious marmalades of quite extravagant tastes, too)or please sit in, if you find a nice corner.Within its white and pastel tiled wall you'll find yourself in vintage furniture with grandma-style dishes and cutlery (but it's your stily granny)The girls behind the counter are lovely and make 1st class coffeewalk in hide from the rain and enjoy some cake and watch the world walk by its windows!"
4,"This delicious Turkish lunch spot has to be one of my favorite, if not my favorite lunches in Hamburg. During the lunch hour (12:30 ownward) the line goes far out the door, so I recommend going early. From there, get your favorite kebab fillings. Other notables are the hot food bar and unlimited bread you can get while waiting in line.The all-German, very lengthy menu is a little tricky, but the good news is everything is delicious so you really can't go wrong.Cash only, so definitely don't show up waving your Visa around."
3,"First of all: No, Steffen Henssler was not there during our visit :( He is the most famous (and best) TV chef and cooking entertainer. Location: The location is very close to an U-Bahn-Station. It is rather small, but got a very high-quality and cozy atmosphere. We just loved it. Everything looked so nice, clean and had a recognizable ono-branding. What always makes a good impression: open kitchen, where you can watch the sushi-chefs make your sushi.But it is always overbooked and hard to get a reservation. So plan your visit a lot in advance.Service: The staff was very friendly. Got everything we wantedFood: Very good food. I've never had such a good fish in my life. I was a little bit sceptic, because I don't like tuna, but the yellowfin tuna was awesome and did not taste like the ordenary tuna (you find on pizza). If you order something, you should have fish/sushi. Pricing: Prices are a little bit higher than in a standard sushi restaurant. We paid around 80 Euros for 2 persons (main dish, desert, drinks). But it is totally worth it for special occasions or just have a nice unique evening, you will remember."
3,"Qrito: Original Californian Cuisine. They have burritos, quesadilla and tacos which you can fill with a wide choice of meat.Either with minced meat, finely chopped meat, orange/lime chicken, chocolate/nuts beef, and of course pork meet. Rice is also added, either lime or spanish, and a variety of vegetables and a sauce of your choice. It's a nice place, with an original idea.The Burrito and Quesadilla are HUGE. you need to be really hungry to eat it up!"
3,"In this area there are a lot of restaurants and Imbiss and it's really difficult to make a choice. From my experience, this is a good one. I've been here thrice and I always trieddifferent dishes and always left completely satisfied. It's not the cheapest place you can find, but probably one of the best in terms of quality. They've got a fixed menu for dinner and for lunch, one can order something from the latter at any time but in the evening it's slightly more expensive. I would recommend to try meat dishes, I still have to try fish but if you are into that there are probably a few better options in this area. Definitely try it, I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself wanting to come back after the first visit."
3,"Very nice, however if you are British and used to hot curries make sure you opt for the hot chilli when they ask you, otherwise the Madras is pretty bland.Also for most people a small box is perfectly enough for lunch."
4,"Great place to enjoy the view. They have good burger and their diabolo pizza is also not bad. If you came late, make sure you can find a good place. Because the beach outside is windy and cold at night, while if you stay too close to the stage inside will make the music too loud to enjoy."
3,"Visit this Starbucks just to look up and out.  Beautiful location, ceiling and views.  That explains my four stars.  The service, prices and most everything else related to this, and most foreign Starbucks, are overrated.  Unless of course you are missing a taste and feeling from home (if you are US American).  Recommendation for Tourists: Go in, look, if you are willing buy a drink and go sit on the Binnenalster to enjoy people and boat watching.  If it is too cold, might as well stay inside and enjoy the ceiling.  If you have a taste for coffee, find a local place far away from Jungfernsteig. Far, far away."
2,The food was normal ... my sister and husband didn't finish the beef ... we have tried much better Persian food in Germany ... the staff were nice though .. price was good too ..
4,"My husband and I bought combo tickets to the zoo and the aquarium (60 euros altogether), and after three hours enjoying the zoo, I wasn't sure that I had the stamina to tour the aquarium. I'm so glad that I powered through, because it was even better than the zoo! My husband does not speak or read any German, and my competency is slightly above elementary, but we found that more of the signage at the aquarium is in both English and German than the signage in the zoo. Even though the name clearly reads ""tropics/aquarium,"" I was expecting to see only water creatures. Wrong: this is where the lemurs and lizards and snakes live, too! I was expecting to see the lemurs in the zoo portion, but no, they are the first exhibit one encounters in the ""tropics/aquarium"" part. I loved the design of the space: the maze-like way one moves from exhibit to exhibit, the seemingly hand-written and hand-drawn signs, and the neat way that the environs of the smaller animals are presented in wooden cabinets as in the Renaissance cabinet of curiosities. Imagine an aquarium and zoo presented in a venue like Sir John Sloane's Museum in London, and that's very close to what one encounters here. If we had been pressed for time and could have only done one venue, I would choose here over the actual zoo, it's so good."
1,Boring drinks and very young crowd. We are getting old and our visit here did not help. The lamp were nice though. A thought: is is just the Germans that put all the booze bottles on the shelves behind the bar? Not helping the decor...
3,Pretty good gelato. I particularly recommend their sugarfree/glutenfree hazelnut flavor.
3,Best lunch place in the area. The Pizza is delicious and the price is unbeatable... For just 4€ you get the classics like Salami etc.At night time the place is usually packed and you have to expect some waiting time. Even with a reservation which gets you wondering why they bother to take them in the first place. With the check comes a complementary bottle (!) of Sambuca... which not too bad (except for the morning afterwards).The focus on the menu really are the pizzas. Just once tried some pasta and it was average at best. So don't even think about anything else.
4,"Spell binding and stunning, Hamburg's Art Museum (Kunsthalle) has all the golden greats, plus plenty of modern allsorts.Placed between the lake, the old town and the Station, it's easy to reach and suitably priced and really is a must see during any visit to Hamburg."
4,Awesome German fish restaurant (try Hamburger Krebssuppe) in old town Hamburg
3,"Considering it was a miserable, rainy day with high windgusts -- This was still a gorgeous area to dine. It would have been nicer on the terrace, but the interior is very modern and nice.I couldn't forget the Sweet Curry Coconut Chicken Wok (Chicken, Mango/Coconut Curry, Tomatoes, Grapes)  if I wanted to. It was decently priced and extremely tasty. I was suprised and very pleased."
4,"Good coffee, good bagel. Supposedly one of the best coffees in town.. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but thought it was delicious. Attentive wait staff, comfortable seating. Recommend!"
4,"If you have ever wondered what it is like to be in India then Jaipur Indian Restaurant is the place to go! Once you walk in you are transported by the smells, the decor and they friendly staff. The carved wood chairs and the music set the mood as you sit down and are presented with a list of mouth watering delicacies. You will want to try them all and you should. I found the best way to experience Jaipur is to come with a group of friends and order a range of different dishes and share it family style. This way you get a little taste of everything so when you decide to come back again you know exactly what you want. The spices, the textures, the flavors, it all combines in your mouth and it leaves you wanting more. Even if your mouth has a 4 alarm fire going on you can wash it down with a cool, creamy, mango lassi! The cold yogurt drink put the fire out while still being able to enjoy the flavors you love. The staff is just the icing on the cake. One of the most friendliest, helpful, and quick staff I have come across in a long time. The prices are average and if you want to make a night of it I would suggest heading over to the English Theatre for a show or walk down the street and party the night away with some cosmic bowling! Jaipur Indian Restaurant is a must! I expect all of you to be lining up at the door the next time I visit."
2,This is a great spot of veggie options. We only got a falafel takeaway sandwich so I can't comment on the rest of the food. The falafel was fresh but the sandwich lacked a bit of something and tasted a bit bland. I think onions would have made a massive difference. My partner's sandwich also had gritty lettuce which wasn't cleaned properly which didn't really add to the experience.
3,After fasting for a week i was searching for a place to eat some potatoes. Ordered backed potatoes less oil and some salad with out salad dressing. But it came with oily potatoes and salad dressing. Apart from it lovely place and staff was friendly. I found my basic backed potato dish was reasonable.
4,"Absolutely excellent! We sat on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant for an excellent meal. They brought us an English menu as soon as they could tell we were not German-speaking. If you're looking for the traditional German meal or something new, you'll find both. I had the traditional veal cutlet (weinerschnitzel) while my brother had a fish salad that was also fantastic. The fried potatoes with bacon were to die for. The bread and spread that they brought to start was also very good. A tad pricey, but worth it for a great meal, service, and people-watching location."
4,enchiladas de mole are amazing !
0,"They really didn't want to serve us, so we left.  They simply would not acknowledge our presence and when we asked they said they don't speak English well and they were too busy and did not have much food left.  Americans before us must have left them with a bad taste.  So, if you do not speak German well, maybe avoid this one."
4,"Excellent customer service, great wine selection. Altogether pleasurable dining experience"
4,"Paralment has a Fantastic Hall for 200 people. Great place. Love the bar area, good Lighting inside, grand entrance, perfect for -The great Gatsby theme :)"
2,"i like to go there sonetimes to eat a very fatty Schnitzel...but the place is not so clean,the service is average and not very friendly and most of the times they get my drink order wrong.The food is average but good enough to go there with some friends for not soending too much money"
1,"Maybe I came to this place with really high hopes because I was really let down with the food. I ordered a burrito with guacamole and asked for it to be inside the burrito and instead I got it on the side which is fine (maybe slight language barrier). When I got my food I was excited to see how massive the burrito was! One thing I notices is that they seem to toast them so it looked more like a Panini than a burrito. Then came the other big mistake, the burrito was extremely soggy! You couldn't pick it up and had to use a knife and a fork. Never have I been served a burrito that needs to be eaten that way. Anyway, it tasted pretty ok but the watery part in the middle kind of ruined the flavors. The guacamole was ok!"
3,"A very nice place in a fast changing Barmbek, Hamburg.  We had Flammkuchen (German/French pizza without tomato base) and it was very nice.  Nice beer from draft and service very friendly (we were served by Korean-German waitress and she was very helpful).  TRUDE is located near the Osterbekkanal right next to a very interesting museeum (museum of work: where else outside of Germany could you find such a museum ...?). There are other typical German, but also international and vegetarian options on the menu.  At night a nice place to sit outside."
4,"A real gem near the cruise ship docks on the Elbe. A restaurant as part of a fish market, the food is excellent and not pricey. The platter of mussels Provencal I had was enormous! only 10 euros! Perfectly cooked and served with baguette and aioli."
4,"The food here is unique. It is austrian with some traditional German plates. They were very friendly, even finding us a table without a reservation. A recommendation : make a reservation at first, just to be safe. They are also happy to have dogs there. To get there by public transport, ones can take the S1 to poppenbüttel or bus 8 to poppenbüttel Bahnhof and walk from there."
1,"A bit pricey but nice burgers, although you have to wait at least 30 minutes to get your order. My last visit I ordered fries with a burger, and I waited 30 minutes for a burger after that had to wait ten more minutes to get fries.Good food, slow service. Overall you can find better places in Hamburg, for less price."
4,"Yet another review to chime in, go if you can. Just remember to be patient. I am not a miniature person but the details really draw you in! Especially the little jokes and punch lines by pressing a button and hunting for the displays. There really was a lot of work and passion put into this wonderland, and that alone impressed me. Those people are truly the geek gods of Hamburg, if little else. Respect!"
4,"We fully enjoyed delicious, creamy pistachio ice cream in home made waffle. A ball of ice cream was surprisingly large, which makes this place very affordable. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. Last, but not least, a special feature for kids - there is a swing outside!"
3,"Wanted to come here for some time and finally had a chance to stop in. First off, and most importantly, the coffee is damn good. We had large cappuccinos and both us had some cake. One was a brownie type thing with white cream somehow on top and the other was a double-chocolate mousse type thing. Basically, we were complimenting the coffee the whole time and really enjoyed it. Strong flavored with just the right amount of whipped milk and really well balanced. I'm super anal about coffee and have a top-of-the-line machine at home and buy good coffee which I grind myself. This is the first place in Hamburg where I would say the coffee is comparable or better to what I can make for myself at home. The cake on the other hand was pretty good but not amazing. My brownie thing was a bit too sweet. The chocolate mousse thing was kind of bland. Unfortunately, I found the sizing also on the small side. I don't like when you get a piece of cake that is half a kilo but when it's tiny I feel scammed a bit. The sizing needs to be increased a bit. I also found the crowd a bit odd in terms of it basically being Schanzen yuppies but they're easily zoned out and I liked the room and atmosphere in general. Plus it was sunny and you can sit nicely outside in front of the door. Anyway, do come and try this place out if coffee is your thing."
2,"My table ordered a wide variety of things - tapas to full meals - and waited nearly two hours for our food. Before ordering we asked the waitresses opinion on a dish and she said something along the lines of ""yeah sure it's good."" When our food finally came out none of us were very happy with the wait, or the food. We mentioned this fact and while the kitchen staff was beyond nice and accommodating, trying to explain the situation, our waitress was annoyed and speaking quite rudely about us in German (which we understood)."
4,What a lovely find. Great fish and daily specials all reasonably priced. Also very good mussels when they're in season. It's nice to sit outside in summer but the Glühwein stand in winter is pretty good too.
4,"A great little cosy cafe auf dem Kiez to hang out on Saturday or Sunday afternoons in St. Pauli. Located in between the Reeperbahn and Millentorn-Stadion, in whats slowly becoming one of my favorite parts of town, this cafe is off the beaten path enough that there are few tourists and mostly locals hanging out in a relaxed atmosphere. Staff is friendly and after a while you feel like a regular. Prices at Mimosa are very fair, you can easily get a drink and a piece of cake for less than 5 Euros. When you consider that all the cakes are made and baked in the back (it smells quite good on days they are making jam), this is a steal- and they are delicious to boot (Im a fan of the chocolate-poppy-cherry cake). The sandwiches are also great and are a good option for a light lunch."
4,"I love this place! This is one of those good friends that just never let you down. The creativity is always inspiring mixing tastes that are truly delightful with beautiful presentation that makes me pause a moment and just take it in. The atmosphere is sophistocated while keeping it very down to Earth. I think anyone would feel comfortable here. I really can't call this place expensive - considering the quality and when you go hereyou know you're getting something good! Check the menu on their website, that way you won't be surprised. :-)"
3,It was pretty amazing but you need to put hours aside to truly appreciate all the fine details.  We were only there a couple of hours and I found it interesting but did not have enough time to check out all the details.  I was pretty disappointed with their USA display but the European countries were absolutely beautiful!
3,"What a cool spot! Located right in the middle of bustling Schanze in Hamburg, this Currywurst and fries joint has a legit vibe going on. The food is really nice, so are the fries.Hip clientele and friendly staff. Really a no fuss no frills place, not fancy but so good. Apparently some guests did not have the best experience but I do not understand why. When it comes to this food, many place are bad, but this one had a high quality.Prices are also good, would recommend."
4,Wow! Words can't describe how amazing this food is. Fish as fresh as can be and prepared on the spot. It's a cute but very small restaurant near the Alster. Everything is 100% German. :)
3,I love Campus Suite franchise. after the Balzac this is my favorite place to hangout in the morning. Campus have really low prices and quite good snacks which are even better than Balzac's. Lots of stuff for Bio & Eco lovers.
3,"My friends constantly referred to this place as the best Turkish restaurant in Hamburg, so we finally went there on Saturday at 2 AM. I was not disappointed! I only tried the Doner Teller, which was of decent size, and good taste. It was a bit cold, but nothing too serious.The service was great, even though the restaurant was full at 2 AM! Will definitely come by next time I am around the area"
4,"What a lovely restaurant. The server/owner was delightful, warm, charming, witty, and welcoming. Phenomenal service. Fantastic chef/owner. Food was outstanding. Perfectly executed. Delicious. Would return in a heartbeat and with great pleasure. Highly recommended!"
2,"I had been craving Mexican food since moving to Hamburg and this seemed to be one of the better local places from Yelp reviews, so I decided to give it a try this evening.I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender was friendly. I decided to order a beef burrito based on ""burrito"" being in the title of this place; although, people sitting next to me ordered quesadillas which looked great, and there are also enchiladas. There are very above average vegetarian options, including spinach, mushrooms, nopal, tofu, and seitan for burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.The burrito wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great. I liked the texture of the tortilla (pressed on the grill), but the fillings weren't particularly good tasting. I also thought the burrito was lacking flavor and could have used more ingredients (some salsa, sour cream, and guacamole like the quesadillas included certainly would've been nice). The steak, rice, and beans weren't bad but didn't taste particularly good. There were also diced tomatoes and onions that were fine.Overall, I would go here if you're in the mood for Mexican food and in the area because it's not bad, but I can't recommend this place for having a particularly good burrito."
4,"Such an amazing place. We had the tuna steak with green peppercorn sauce and the assorted fish assortment in white wine & tomato sauce off of the specialty menu. Everything was absolutely sublime, and they helpfully brought more bread to help soak up the left over sauces. The potatoes that came with the tuna were also unusually good, as though rosemary went into them before they were fried. A fairly unforgettable experience for these weary travelers."
3,"Swedish restaurants are pretty rare, so I guess this one goes all in on being Swedish. First of all its logo is some kind of a Dala horse, a symbol of Sweden. And inside you have Lilla Åland chairs (well, fake replicas most likely), probably the most popular chair design from Sweden. So the atmosphere and interior makes me feel like I'm at home.I have only tried the meatballs here, and I like them. If you want a heavy meal and like potatoes, I think you'll like this place and its food too."
3,"A favorite Döner spot!  But you must know my history with Döner.  First, I cannot pronounce it.  Try as I might, now over a few years and many different coaches, I cannot say the word without sounding like a Northeastern American, which I am not.  Second, I tried Döner in Berlin, some say the capitol of Döner, first in 2006.  Despite all of my American friends enthusiastic and sometimes overkill approach to this food object, I did not like it.  Therefore, I did not try it again until about 2 years ago.  Still, I could not adjust to the taste, especially with such yucky tastes springing up in my tastebud memories.  But finally, I was convinced to try the skewers, and loved them.  I must admit the portions are too big, but now at least I try my best to get through them.Now I live with Döner experts.  They can tell you all the best places here in Hamburg AND Berlin.  They will tell you waiting in line for that one super crazy popular spot in Berlin is, well, not really worth it with all the selection available for Döner.  And I was eating with them at this restaurant.  Öz Review: It is fresh.  The restaurant is clean.  The food is great.  The selection of dishes is traditional, and everyone I have tried is great.  Suggestions: Order dessert, you will be more than pleasantly surprised. Lesson:  Even if you do not like something after a few tries, if friends of yours INSIST that you will love it THIS time, give it a try."
0,"Is it even possible to provide slower service? I would't recommend stopping by there but there is not many places in the area for a coffee, so..."
4,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, definitely one of my favourite bars in Hamburg. The sofas look as if time traveled from last century, and you'd probably not want to look at them during daylight, but they're so comfy and worn down, they practically engulf you when sitting on them. Drinks here are decent, but not great, but you'd probably come here for the atmosphere and the people anyways."
4,"I have definitely reviewed the Hafenbahnhof before. But since Qype doesn't remember, here I go again! It feels like miles away although certain people may argue it's not, it is. But don't let that put you off. Great views of the docks out of the windows whilst you sip a cold astra and watch Hamburg's very own Ricky Kings play. It's all good."
4,"This was a truly fantastic meal, possibly the best we have had on our trip in Germany.I got the filets of 3 fish in dijon sauce, and my partner ordered the schnitzel.  The fish was out of this world, some of the best I have ever had, and the sides it came with were amazing as well.  To drink I had the peppermint and ginger tea which they make themselves, and the waitress/owner offered refills of hot water for the tea, and brought tap water to drink (a rare pleasure for Canadians who are used to always having free tap water at restaurants).  The tea was really an unexpected bonus to the meal, as I was expecting dried tea, instead of fresh leaves and ginger.  Even the sugar to add to the tea was crystal rock sugar instead of plain ground white sugar.I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the fish or the local fare, however you should make a reservation or be prepared to sit outside / wait, as it is very popular!"
4,"3 Zimmer Wohnung is a hybrid between house-party and laid back pub, with a dose of early 70's flair, a shot of late 90's tune mix and a bunch of people you don't know. Yet. The pub is divided into 4 sections; the kitchen (also the bartop), the living room, the bedroom and a small kicker area. All of these are dimly lit, and have shelves of random books and tidbits scattered around. In the living room, we found a half-dressed Barbie doll and a 1988 Guinness book of Word Records. While I wouldn't actually consider hitting the sack at ""3 Zimmer Wohnung"", it seems to be a great place for a laid-back evening excursion, especially as the music is low enough allow you to have conversations with your buds, but loud enough to sing and jiggle along. Very recommended, can't wait to go back!"
4,"This is a Part of Hamburg anyone should have seen. Besides Dungeon, Miniatur Wunderland and a Coffee Shop there is a lot to see. Use the possibility of a Barkassenfahrt in order to complete the impression of this old part of the habour."
3,"An Argentinian Steakhouse is what they are going for here. It's a great spot with indoor and outdoor seating.For our appetizer, we went with the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp didn't seem the freshest and it was drowning in sauce so it was just ok.For our entrees, we naturally went with the steaks that came with a side of a baked potato with sour cream on it. We tried to order the steaks medium rare but the steaks were more on the rare side. That was fine by me, the flavors of the steak still came out very well. The ambiance is really nice, as its a bit darker inside and they have candles on all the tables. There seemed to be a birthday going on at a couple of tables away from us. It was really cute, they turned up the music and served the birthday boy dessert with a whole bunch of sparklers in it. Not sure if the family arranged that or if the restaurant does that usually for birthdays but it was cute.At the end of your meal, its nice that that they also offer you a little after dinner drink. We had the amaretto, which was a great end to our meal and nice to know that it was included and was not extra.I will be back whenever I have a craving for steaks soon!"
2,"Not a lot of mexican places in Hamburg.   We went here searching for a fix.Overall service was good.  There is English menu included.   The menu is very simple; 2 pages for food.  More pages for alcohol.   We started with guacamole and it was good.  Hubby thought it was a little too Limey but he was eating every bit of it.  And it seemed homemade.  We had a lime margarita and mango margarita.  For price, it was pretty small but it tasted pretty good, maybe too much tequila (not exactly a bad thing).  Kids had cold milk.   My hubby asked for true mexican beer (dos Equis Amber, negro modelo which were on menu) but they were out.  They did have corona and German beer.The kids has the burrito with queso.  Considering the price and 3 tortillas, we had them split.  The tortillas were small, corn, and ultimately not a very large serving.  It also was covered in salsa.I had burrito with chicken with green salsa.  Overall it was good but was made with corn tortillas and small.  Taste was good though.   Hubby had enchiladas with beef and mole.   Again corn (more expected) and he was happy with mole.We ended dinner with their only dessert which was plantains in honey and cream. It was ok....  Not my thing.Considering the choices, it was okay for our fix.  Guacamole and a margarita were my favorites.    Also there weren't a lot of people there on a Saturday night.  Btw, they open at 6pm and hard to park."
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining, albeit oftentimes too loud. Everyone wants to be ""most important"". Whatever, these are all trust-fund babies or advertising drones and they never change wherever you are.The food is mediocre at best but there are some highlights. The place is not consistent which is probably the biggest complaint about their food. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow.....I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that threw it off. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish and we both do regularly get the Caesar salad, which actually is more like a chicken-teriyaki salad. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this and you go here knowing what you're going to get. At least the crowd is consistent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table. Of course, if you want to show off your Porsche, Ferrari, or Lambo, you can park it right out front and there are a lot of windows so that everyone WILL see that it's you. If you feel ignored, rev the engine a couple times......it's usually loud inside."
0,"It was our last day in our vacation in Germany. We went here today past 4pm and hoping to have an early dinner. There was only 2 guests when we entered and the restaurant was not busy at all. When we came in, we checked the menu and asked if they have an english version. The caucasian guy who approached us kept talking in German. My bf asked for the buffet price and the waiter got more irritated. Then suddenly he just walked away from us!!! This is so far the most arrogant and most rude customer service we've ever encountered! Worst is when we are leaving the restaurant, the other employee gave us the middle finger!!! We were like, 'what is wrong with these people'?!!!I used to be a waitress and we treat people with respect. We were completely appalled with this experience!!!"
0,"The W O R S T fish I've had in Hamburg so far!I'll keep it simple stupid:1. The place reeks. 2. The quality of the fish is horrendous as it is frozen and flavourless. 3. Even the sides are not fresh and every bit of nutrition cooked out of them. They only got one star because the staff was friendly. However, I don't go to restaurants because the staff is friendly."
4,"A nice place with friendly stuff , and the food is AMAZING !! Highly recommend this place !"
4,"This place is absolutely amazing and one of the coolest things I've seen in Hamburg. The detail work and the depth in all of the models is stunning. It's also brilliant how they've done the set up so that children see one thing, and adults see something more. In many ways it's two museums layered in and intermixed with each other all at the same time. The attention to detail and creativity that defines this museum makes it a very memorable experience. It is hands-down one of Hamburg's absolutely must not miss experiences no matter what your age or interests are."
3,"nice burrito place in the Grindelviertel. I've been to the one at Osterstrasse before, but here it was a little more complicated to order your burrito with your choice of all the different toppings. Kinda like ordering a subway sandwich. But my burrito was pretty tasty. The should have some sauces on the table, however, and I didn't like my friends' Guacamole too much."
4,Nice restaurant!!! The food is delicious and cheap.
3,"It's ""Australian"", but to be honest I've never noticed any antipodeans here. You can get average Australian beer if you like, but I recommend sticking with the German stuff. I've always wondered whether they'd show Australian sport on tv, somehow I doubt it (I've never really noticed any TVs), but maybe they do. Actually, randomly, the best thing about down under are their chicken wings. Plentiful, relatively cheap and with a myriad of sauces. They also do some decent burgers, but weirdly they come on toasted baguettes rather than buns."
3,"I like Café Brooks. It is a nicely decorated coffee shop, with very nice staff. I enjoy the variety of cakes and the different tea flavors. On the weekend there is breakfast offer. You can choose your breakfast by ticking boxes on the breakfast menu. The breakfast was very tasty and the staff was very nice. As the coffee shop was very crowded we had to wait for a while to be served."
2,"This place was mobbed when we ventured in on a cold Tuesday night in March. We had been looking for somewhere to a have quick drink with a decent atmosphere and it fitted the bill. Named after a gangster from America during the 1920's the place had photos of him everywhere. It was was also dark and moody looking, set up to be like a cocktail bar that a mobster might frequent.In terms of a place to have a drink this could well have been a 4 star as it was busy, had some atmosphere, attentive service and a good array of drink options. For two main reasons for me it is only a three star. Firstly they allow smoking inside. For me it is now a very much out dated practise that no way should be allowed inside bars. Secondly the drinks were a bit on the pricey side working out at 27 euros for three. So works out about £7 a drink, which is pricey compared to other places in the city. If these two things don't bother you I reckon you will love it here. Decent cocktail bar, certainly busy on a Tuesday night."
3,"This is a pretty local place with good for for a very fair price. The small soup was pretty big and delicious. Everything was fresh. Only thing is that the meat seemed a hit dry, but overall great food."
3,"Awesome old-school hip-hop! I came here last night (a Monday). Though it was a bit empty, the Dj was awesome and the drinks, tasty.  Their drink menu is, impressively, extensive. Was not a fan of the cigarette smoke, but it Is Germany, so I guess it comes w/ the territory.  Very friendly bartender and ladies bathroom! If you want a chill, relaxed environment w/ great 90s music, this is your place!"
4,"Easily one of the best authentic Korean restaurants outside of Seoul. A pure, honest delivery of everything I adore about Korean cuisine.I ate here every lunch for a week, and sampled a broad range of items and found it all good.The Kimchi Jjigae is punchy, spicy and enriched with belly pork and pork broth. Loaded with flavorful kimchi and presented with a bowl of rice and 3 banchan, this was a must have staple for me at every meal.The pork bulgolgi was tasty, spicy, and fatty--perfect for stirring into rice and more banchan.The djajiangmein was a surprisingly pleasing bowl of spring udon like noodles, earthy slightly sweet black bean paste, and little morsels of pork to give depth and rounded mouth feel.Bibimbap was accompanied by fiery Gochujang sauce and loads of banchan vegetables.Service is friendly and quick--walk all the way in to the end of the bar to place your orders for lunch. Reservations necessary at night--especially on the weekends! They are fully booked for good reason."
0,"I have been to this place today after reading so many positive reviews about it. I had to drive all the way around 40 minutes on a rainy day. To make it short: the location at Steindamm 58 isn't the best or worst either, at least it didn't bother me at all. Even though my first impression was negative right after i entered this place, I queued up like others for the pos register. I ordered a so called jumbo durum for 5.00 euros even, and a beverage for 1.75 euros. I hat to stay in the queue to receive my order. While waiting I had the chance to observe that previously prepared various meat products were unsavorily displayed to customers despite being partially spoiled. But I stayed in the line, because the durums were allegedly prepared fresh. Finally it was my turn to get my order. The meal was a huge portion of a freshly baked  thin flatbread some cut of grilled ground meat with mixture of a salads. The meat wasn't hot enough, some parts  were not evenly cooked, some other still raw. I really was hungry, but couldn't swallow the first bite and had to immediately leave that horrible fast food place! Honestly I was extremely disappointed and wouldn't waste my time again, so to speak not even under any given circumstances..."
4,"When the sun is shining, this is the place to be! The associates are fun and relaxed but still focus on service and remain spontaneous.It is a little bit high prices... though sometimes life is to enjoy it!!!"
4,"Came here for a very relaxing Sunday brunch with my man! Their menu changes daily as they use the freshest ingredients so don't be surprised if you can't find a menu!When you first enter, it may look a bit small but head on back past the kitchen where there's more seating and outdoor seating as well. We sat in the back in some comfy chairs. The decor of the place is so charming! Our waitress quickly greeted us and told us the daily specials and her recommendations. She was really nice and attentive! We ended up ordering the breakfast meal for one and added an order of their house made pancakes. I ordered a tea and was pleasantly surprised when the waitress popped out into the garden to pick fresh mint leaves for my tea!We started with a refreshing bowl of yogurt with fresh fruits and musli. Then our breakfast meal came which had everything you'd want for a brunch. There were various cold cuts of meats to choose from, cheese, caprese salad bites, some cucumber slices, olives, grapes, and jams and spreads for everything! We also got a basket of bread and a fresh hard boiled egg. Shortly after, our pancakes arrived and they looked fantastic! There was a bit of fruit jam drizzled on it with fresh mint and a chocolate spread and a maple sauce as accompaniments. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and tasted divine! Super fluffy and not eggy at all. Adding the mounds of the chocolate spread to it also helps with the deliciousness :)All in all, This was probably one of the better brunch experiences we have had this far being here. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are reasonable and the staff is also super friendly. Our brunch only cost us about 20€ so we'll be coming back soon to try more daily specials for sure!"
3,"Good! Maybe feels a little too casual, caféteria-like for the price level, but food quality was really delicious."
2,I had expected a little more after reading about this place. The cookie was tiny and the cappuccino a little weak and not really hot (I am a little bit picky though when it comes to coffee) still a better place to have a coffee in hamburg ;)
4,"It's bigger inside than it seems, many white tables, and fully booked at dinnertime. Don't come without a reservation.Food and service are superb here; a confidently limited set of dishes, creative food without going overboard, generous portions, and not too expensive for what you get either. Everything feels pleasantly un-rushed, making this a nice place to dine out with a little time.Same goes for the wines: a very tasteful selection, and all sized and priced so you'll be happy to order more.Nailed it, don't change the concept! :)"
3,"Just went to Kardelen with a bunch of people from the office. I was told that no-one had reviewed it because no-one could ever remember it's name. Well it wasn't even listed in Qype! As it happens I also forgot the name, but clever me took a photo ;) Anyway I had a chicken doner plate (it came with rice and salad and sauce). It cost EUR5.50 and also came with free bread and tea! It was pretty huge (see photos) but I was pretty hungry and so polished it off... I'd definitely go back again."
4,"The best baked potato I have eaten. Ever. In my life. And it was cheap too. If i remember correctly it cost something like 3.90 EUR. I highly recommend it to everyone, including people who like me, normally do not like baked potatoes. Me and my friends liked it so much that we went there 3 times in two days!"
4,"This cute little restaurant serves an amazing breakfast! You can choose between elk salami, boiled eggs with caviar cream, semolina pudding with fruit and various other delicious things! The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. Reservation recommended!"
2,A regular Starbucks place with nice and interesting interior and a truly nice views of the lake
3,"Great place, friendly (and cheeky!) waiters, tasteful food served in decent portions. Has all the Chinese classics that Europeans like without taking too much of the authenticity away."
1,"Would love to give them a higher rating but the carrot quiche that we had was TERRIBLE. I have no doubt that because we were the Americans we were subjected to what we were told was ""the last of the quiche"" and ""the only quiche available"" was the carrot quiche. The gentleman ahead of us had ham and the 4 people that came in after us also were given the option of ham, of course they took ham. Awful, awful, awful"
3,Great atmosphere. Fresh food. Good service. Bustling. Reservations recommended but helpful to get seated if not. Smaller menu selection. Menu changed weekly.
3,"This is a pretty big and nice Irish pub. You've got your typical Guinness and Magners but also surprisingly a large selection of craft beer. I had the 'Zweitel' and that was pretty damn good. This is a great place to hang out with others but as I came to watch the footie; they have 2 TVs on which they show games, it was a little disappointing with the music playing and no game sounds being heard hence the loss of a star. Great bar to hang but not super great to watch football in my opinion."
4,"No printed menu that I ever saw. A blackboard that looks to be updated daily on the wall. I took the waiters recommendation for what to have. Antipasti to share, secondi of pasta with truffles and entree of fresh grilled sea bass that he promised he would bone out. Really good. Never would have ordered that without his recommendation. My dining companion had homemade ravioli topped with white truffles. He was very happy. Good service that moved along but didn't feel rushed. Very reasonable prices for what we had. Under 100€ for two with three courses and drinks. This is a very small but popular dining place. It might be hard to sit and talk and just drink.  But there are other choices near by for that. Just dine here first!"
3,"The service was not great...we got there and just stood waiting to be acknowledged for about 15 minutes. They were super busy and finally someone came to take our names down. The seating is uncomfortably close to your neighbor, hardly any personal space. The only good thing was the food."
3,"Very cheap and delicious fresh tasting food. The falafel isn't anything special but tastes among the best I've had in Hamburg. I ordered the ""falafel box"" which was pretty much a small sampler of all their vegetarian items on a small plate for 4€ (includes three falafel balls). Everything tasted fresh and very good - I was very happy with the meal for the cheap price.There's actually like 5+ falafel places right next to each other in this area. I've only tried Falafelstern and Kimo (the restaurant literally next door also serving falafel). I would definitely recommend Falafelstern over Kimo for better tasting falafel and sides."
4,"Roth is a great little cosy pub/restaurant. However, if I'm honest I've never eaten here, so I'm just reviewing it as a pub. They have Rothaus Tannenzäpfle on tap, along with quite a few Irish beers, including Guiness and Murphys, so they have the beer pretty much nailed. The staff are friendly enough, and because of the restaurant side of things you get table service for your beer, which is nice. I'll have to try the food sometime"
4,"Beside its small room, the coffee here is good, the staff is nice and there is wifi. I can comfortably seat on a sofa with my computer, take the WiFi (probably not from there but it works nicely), and spend hours. Their cappuccinos are big!"
1,"Why does this have such great reviews?- great location (across the street of Hauptbahnhof)- people talk about this positively- hyped-----------------------------------------------------------------However I ate here I think 3 times. But always picked by my friends.Most positiv reviews came from non-asians I guess (of course I didn't check all reviews but I'm sure haha). It's like you are crazy about chinese beer, because you've never tried german beer hahahahahaha.People love Quan do because they've never tried the real good vietnamese pho.For 6,90€ or something the pho (vietnamese noodle soup) is way to small and you don't get side dishes here. And the soup is way to flavorless, not intense enought tho.YOU WANNA TRY REAL GOOD PHO? . . . GO TO VIETNAM!!! hahaha I'm joking.No there are better places in Hamburg then here. Don't waste your money.-----------------------------------------------------------------GOLDEN RULE:Always go to a pho place where you only see asians, because they know what's good.i.e. Always go to Spanish restaurants, where you only see spanish people.Always go to Indian restaurants, where you only see indians. You get the point.It's the same. You don't wanna get fake food, you wanna get the real deal. So you better start asking asians haha."
4,"First time visiting Hamburg and happened upon this gem! This is the most fantastic pizza...I love it...seriously. #likeseriouslybestpizzaeverPros:*As I said, it's one of the best pizzas I've had. Worth every penny.*Quick; ordered when I got there and it was ready in about 10 minutes (no line when I arrived)*Friendly; every employee was kind and had a smile; they were very patient with the ""unsure American"", lol*English-speaking; much to my benefit, the employees spoke English -- I would not have been able to order otherwise.Cons:*small place; not appropriate for a sit-down meal if that's what you want*can be pricy; I got a ""large"" (medium by U.S. standards) with ""all the meats"" (which actually surprised the employees, lol) and paid about 13EUR -- but also like I said, worth every penny!*maybe not the best place/location/area of town for small children*CASH ONLY (I've found this is rather typical around the area in general, but this place only takes cash...be prepared)"
3,Always busy at lunch time and sometimes a bit to crowded. Although the food really tastes good... Love the pickled garlic chilis for seasoning. Unfortunately it sometimes takes a bit to get served and some of the serving staff is grumpy.
4,"AMAZING! Kittles has done everyone in the Qype community a great service by finding out what the hell this bar is actually called. We don't have the concept of nameless bars in the UK, but in works well here. This place is always busy, in a good way. Sofas that would look hideous in your own living room really fit in well with the downbeat decor, think, faded grandeur with a bit of damp. Great place to meet people as you have to sit next to them. Check it out."
4,"A wonderful French place. Relaxed and mellow, yet with great cooking. We had a enjoyable Sunday lunch. Not updated English menu. Not all positions on the menu were there. But really worth our time and the price for three corse is a bargain."
4,"We went during a weekday during lunch time & avail the lunch menu. It was not full, thus, we enjoyed a good service from them. They have a variety of dimsums to choose from. Choices for the main course is also very good. The menu have english translation/description in it and the waitress can speak mandarin. The prices are affordable. Each of the menu comes with a complimentary appetizer: soup -or- springroll. We enjoyed all the dishes (see submitted photos) and giving them all two thumbs up! The restaurant size is kinda small, but they do have two big round tables available for people coming in groups. Will definitely come back & will definitely recommend to others."
2,"Your typical Irish bar. Probably the most authentic in Hamburg. Very traditional interior. Dark lighting so a good place to come and hide. Very friendly service. The beer's good. Location is easy to reach right on Grossneumarkt. There's outdoor seating during the warmer months. I've only tested some of their food and it was always good. Nothing spectacular but definitely enjoyable. The only thing I really dislike about this place is that at times it can be really full and there isn't that much seating available inside. Further, service can be a bit slow at times and is often pre-occupied with chatting at the bar as opposed to keeping glasses full. If you're into the Irish thing though a perfect jaunt for you in Hamburg."
4,"Although I cannot make myself endorse anything related to tobacco I must admit the charm, kind staff and excellent espresso drinks at D&D saved my morning for a week while visiting Hamburg. Never start smoking!  Just drink coffee and enjoy the atmosphere outside away from second hand smoking :)"
0,"Did this Place shut down ? I can not reach anyone by Phone ( the Number you have dialed is unavailable ""040 43183050"" and the Website ist down and Domain for Sale !Does anyone know more about this ?"
4,"I found this roastery yesterday, led by my nose when I was in the vicinity. The roaster gave me a personal tour of the facilities and I had a very good (and amazingly inexpensive; all drinks are 1,- EUR) Capuccino in the café in the upper floor."
3,"Shikara is a good Indian food place. I have only tried their lunch buffet which for a flat fee you get a full meal (an entrée, main course and desert).  They have friendly staff and a nice outdoor garden area."
4,"Dank stinking grungy hole of a bar. Which I like. We saw a pretty intense gig on Saturday night (experi-mental rock), hooked up with some randoms and crashed a house party afterwards. If you don't like overheated, overcrowed hellholes... stay away!"
4,"Beautiful venue both inside and outside - has both indoor and outdoor seating, chilled out lounge area, the type of place you'd make your second home if it was your local :-) Great thin crust pizza, excellent beer selection, very reasonably priced. Seemed like a popular place to take your date on Thursday night as we were surrounded by couples. definitely will be back!"
2,"There certainly is a new wave of ice cream in Germany ... but I wondered why people keep lining up at Eisliebe? Is it that it's 20-30 cents cheaper than at Schmidt's up the road?Eisliebe's few flavours from Amarena to Vanilla are as vanilla as they come, and so is the quality. I actually threw away some of it, it was so bland."
3,"The location is not suitable for finding this restaurant ""just by walking"". The interior is not something you want if you do fine dining. But the steaks and burgers are just awesome. They take the meat business very seriously. I mean VERY. Guaranteed you do not leave hungry from this place.For casual dinner with friends who like burgers and steaks, this is a must place to test. Keep in mind, that they accept cash only, no credit cards, so prepare yourself with cash when you arrive. The prices are not too high, but due to meat coming form USA, it is more expensive than normal restaurants serving meat."
4,"This is the equivalent of street food in Hamburg.  In the downtown area there are two right across the street from each other.  No place to sit, just stand and eat your sausages. I had the grilled krakauer sausage not the Curry Wurst.  They were awesome."
4,"Went to Das Dorf yesterday to have my BDay dinner. it was GREAT! I even got my Wunderkerze plus the obligatory service team cuddle (check out my pic). had Hamburg's traditional Labskaus (google it by yourself he..he..he..) and it turned out to be my BEST Labskaus so far. Highly recommended. as for the atmosphere: very cozy with dimmed lights, antique furniture and silver"
4,"I've known this place for years, since when it first opened, then with the expansion, and to me it represents something beyond great food, beyond incredible success.  It is simply a brilliant operation.  If you order a durum doener for take out, and stand by the kitchen counter, it is like watching the movements of a Swiss watch - - but no watch part ever handed you one of the best doeners anywhere (superb balance of toothy vegetables, onion, and meat) with such a warm smile, and such care.  The in-house meals are superb value - - such a great spread of wonderful substances and delicious flavors.   The semi-outrageous colors, the constant bustle, the thoughtfulness and graciousness of the extremely busy staff - - it's no wonder that even after the expansion, this place is packed no matter when you go (mostly with Turks in the know).   Incredibly handy location right next to Altona Bhf.  It is one of a kind, and it is a kind worth enjoying often."
4,This is a tiny private restaurant tucked away on a side street. We picked it because is was close and it had good Yelp ratings. Seating is very tight and people may need to move tables to let you get to your seat. The diners were a mix of locals and European tourists. We were the only Americans. I had the krautspatzle and the others in our group had maultasche gebraten. I thought my  krautspatzle dish was excellent. It was very different from the brats we had been having for lunch. I tried some of my wife's dish and it too was very tasty. Portions were quite large and I could not finish all of my lunch. We would definitely return to this restaurant.
2,"Firstly the most negative points I have about Balutschistan are not entirely their own fault. We took too many people, which rendered the sit-on-floor room very uncomfortable. This combined with the room being very dark led to me chipping my tooth (which I'm pretty pissed off about). Also with the room being so crowded (see photo) the waiters couldn't get in and the people in the middle of the room were only half tuned-in for passing things along. Yeah, it wasn't the greatest experience. Food-wise though the place was pretty good. I ordered a ""please make it more spicey"" lamb rogan josh and it came nicely spiced. The beers were decent and the service reasonably prompt, especially given that there were 20 odd of us. One downside is that the food is quite pricey by Hamburg standards. A curry and two beers came to EUR17"
3,They have very delicious truffle burger . That is outstanding. Whenever I am in hamburg I go for this delicious burger place. They have also nice drinks but more German brands( soft drinks). They are polite and quick. They take Covid policy very serious which Is amazing. To burger lovers this place is haven. I recommend Ottos burger  .
3,Nice selection of cocktails and Mexican dishes. 5 for 33EUR cocktail pack with a different set for guys and girls :) Also nice location to go around the town after dinner\ drinks. Wi-Fi didn't work on my Android phone - a simpler configuration could be better.
3,"Fabulous sushi! We could not sit outside as we arrived 5 people instead of the 4 we had booked for but there was no problem as during lunch hour there was plenty of space inside (apparently booking is a must for evenings). We were seated close to the kitchen/counter which was a little noisy. You can order a mixed platter to share or if you are picky and a vegetarian like me you can go for individual rolls. The 3 I ordered on recommendation were waaaay too much, go for two if you are real hungry and one for a snack! They have a veggie roll with tempura inside which adds a yummy crunch and extra taste, the other veggie roll I had was kind of bland in comparison. There are also other hot food options if you like neither sushi nor fish, and this is where they are losing one star for me as there's meat, there's fish, but there's nothing vegetarian (this, and the one ""boring"" roll I had). The restaurant has a nice atmosphere too and can seat larger groups so if you want to dine out with sushi lovers it's the perfect place."
4,"I an American from SD in the area for business.  I found this bar through Yelp.  I came on a Monday night and it was cozy and mostly empty.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The beer was great, the food was ok but I wasn't expect much for bar food. I returned on Thursday and the place was packed with locals.  The staff was different but still friendly.   It's a great place to hangout especially since there is not much else in the neighborhood."
0,We went there at 10:50pm yesterday to have a glass of wine. The waiter never cleaned the table nor did he ask us what we would like to have. The restaurant was about 70% full. This non-service is horrible. Never go there !
3,Great food.  The staff was friendly and the food was on point. Decent wifi which was extremely necessary during my vacation. Cocktails were perfect.
3,"I daresay I liked this little restaurant as much as any bistro I ate at while visiting Paris!Le Plat du Jour has a traditional fixed course French menu dinner setup - 30 euros to pick one from each of three courses. There is one ""plat du jour"" representing the nightly special you can elect for your entree.I started with a salad but my co-diners got the pate. I have to admit I was a little food envious looking at their plates! The mains were all very nice - our table had a fish, some sort of very rich looking liver dish, and the ""plat du jour"" involving chicken drumsticks. All with requisite amounts of butter and French sauce, right in the middle of Hamburg."
3,"Fine fast food place. The burger and bun were fine and so were the fries. Nothing extraordinary or  different, but a fine meal and good distance from the train station where we arrived."
3,"Who here shortly after the opening appears, actually always finds a place. That changes completely fast, at the latest if the conception is terminated in the nearby theatre, becomes it here very much full, then one has sometimes the impression the kitchen is something overtaxed (can last already times longer). But for a really good meal first you have tu find the place. No sign points the way to us. One must belong to the insider. The village is accommodated a wine tube, in a cellar, with a remarkably variedly bill of fare."
4,"Cafe Mimosa is a great little St. Pauli breakfast spot. There are two main options; cheese & meat or lots of cheese and both are great. The cheese breakfast comes with brie, goats cheese, mozzarella with tomato & balsamic vinegar, cream cheese, some other cheese, grapes, butter, jam, two slices of homemade bread, a bun and a coffee. Basically everything on the plate is of the highest quality, and they give you the perfect amount, so that you'll finish everything, but not want more. The cheese & meat option is the same except you swap the goats cheese & mozzarella for palma ham and some good quality salami. Great value at EUR6."
4,"Beautiful, spacious restaurant in the basement of Hamburg's historic city hall building. Unlike most city hall restaurants in Germany, this one is relatively fancy with excellent service and great food and drinks. Compared to other restaurants of its class in Hamburg it is downright cheap. The food is mostly modern interpretations of traditional Hamburg and North German dishes. Great place to take a date!"
2,"(M)eatery is a drop in the recent flood of upper class steak houses that has beleaguered the Hamburg food scene recently. That said, word-of-mouth had been rather positive, so I prepared my inner carnivore for a feast. Interior design is, of course, a matter of personal taste, but (M)eatery's rather cool interior rather didn't appeal to mine. Service was swift and friendly, so a (M)eatery Deluxe Burger was ordered quickly. The burger was explained at length in the menu as a very elaborate and distinguished piece of meaty cuisine, so my expectations were rather high. For a price of EUR 18 one gets a beef burger with shallots, home made chips and Wasabi mayonnaise. One even has the choice of different kinds of rolls. Regrettably, what came out of the kitchen didn't warrant the rather lengthy and somewhat pretentious explanation in the menu. First of all my burger had been cooked very medium instead of medium rare (as I'd ordered it); the Wasabi mayonnaise is plain silly, as its very dominant taste simply doesn't suit this kind of dish. But worst of all were the chips, which were very soggy and fatty indeed. Still feeling a bit hungry I, somewhat cynically, ordered soufflé for desert, wondering if the kitchen could actually handle such a delicate dish. Alas, I should have known better: the soufflé was served far to quickly to have been made properly, so what I got in the end was a decent, but uninspiring mixture of a cake and flan. Would I visit Meatery (already fed up with the spelling) again? If I was invited, probably yes, but not for my own money. I guess the search for Hamburg's No.1 steakhouse continues."
3,"A very cool concept for good food in a really great location but with a slightly fast food twist. Va piano promises a great social location with great pizza and pasta to choose from, made freshly in front of you. My friend had the tortollini pesto pasta which was really well presented and tasted excellent. I had the calzone pizza which by nature took longer to cook yet was well worth the wait. This was one of the nicest calzone pizzas I have had in my life. A great chain with a great idea, if you are I'm the area stop looking for other places right now."
3,"This is sort of place I would come to a lot if I wasn't married with two children and had a highly stressful job that took up all of my time. Or in my 40s. So, the format is like being in your coolest friends apartment, complete with sofas, pool table, cracking tunes, and an open basement with dancefloor and various industrial remnants of it's time as a DildoFabrik (yes it's an easy translation) . It's also one street from the main Reeperbahn, not hugely far from St Pauli / Millerntor / all the fun of the fair. So perfectly located for good times and a friendly bohemian crowd. Very popular with the Qype Kids, and the venue for our excellent 2011 Xmas (Q)iez party."
3,"Just in terms of the art of plating, this restaurant is easily in the top 10 of all time that I have ever dined at or experienced. Every dish was exceptionally photo-worthy, from multiple angles, and literally compelled you to take out your smartphone and photograph it. Simply put, our dinner was art on a plate. The food here also had many different flavor profiles and flavor combinations that would test the range of many people's palettes. The cuisine is French-Moroccan. Some could easily find it odd or mis-matched. I appreciated it because it was something new and often had me saying ""hmmm...interesting...good, but very different.""Seven courses per person were a bit on the pricey side -- moths flew out of my wallet after I paid the bill -- but it was a wonderful celebration dinner that night, all in all, for multiple reasons.If you really want to taste something a little bit different, bold, new or refreshing, where the food is beautifully plated, then this is the place."
3,"Came here with my wife on a Wednesday night, and we were surprised by the 20 minute queue.  From the smells going around, we can understand why.It's a small space that is stylishly designed reminding of Ramen houses we've been to in Vancouver, BC.  We ordered the katsu don which was a little greasy and on the large side, but it was still crispy.  My wife had the special shio ramen, and I had the special miso ramen.  The shio ramen stock was much lighter than we were used to, but it was good after cracking the tamago and mixing around the yolk.  The miso ramen was fantastic.  Great creamy broth and a little spicy. Is it the best ramen restaurant I've been to?  I would say no, since we've been to ones in London, Seattle, and Vancouver.  For having this place in Hamburg, it's the most authentic thing I've had in a long time.  Big plus that the servers speak Japanese.  We're adding this to our monthly rotation of restaurants for sure."
3,"A pretty cool place near the Schanze. Your typical bar/lounge concept with some interesting design concepts. Without going into details others have already written about, notable is that the crowd tends to be in their twenties (college kids), half the people stand out front so they can smoke and the bartenders tend to be quite nice (rare in Hamburg bars). The chick with half her breasts tattooed is totally cool and the Asian guy is always helpful. There's also a small room downstairs which I found a bit claustrophobic.this is totally skip-able. Definitely worth checking out though as it's one of the morein places when it comes to the Schanze."
4,Fantastic experience and customer service. We accidentaly bought tickets for the wrong day and they let us join the tour anyway. The chocolate is amazing and we had so so so much fun!
4,"Beautiful French restaurant serving fantastic seafood food. Amazing deserts, carefully selected wine and Bouillabaisse à la Marseille will make you come back! Not many dishes on the menu, but along with fish and seafood you'll see one regional (Northern Germany) speciality which brings an intersting twist. Simply but tastefully furnished. Very polite and attentive service.  And what I found pretty amazing, families with kids are welcome. So if you're put off by snobby French restaurants in Hamburg, try Marseille!"
0,"Too expensive, fried noodles tasted disgusting! Too much oil and my friend and I both got food poisoning from it ! Can't recommend at all  !"
3,"I have to admit, I was intrigued by the menu featuring a salad with carmel corn. Salad was great and Iberian pork fabulous. Service was also very good. Enjoyed the meal."
3,Always go here when in hamburg. It's god great schnitzel which is always good. Nice location overlooking the canal in central hamburg. Only issue with the place is the service is painfully slow. Been here 3 times now and every time had to ask a few times for a beer or a table or a menu. They seem to be always busy so service is not something they have dealt with. Great place otherwise though and always a good atmosphere.
4,Wonderful service! Worth the wait! Even the Caesar salad was great! Thanks for introducing me to some Hamburg Gins!
3,"Best Mai Tai in the city & panorama view on Alster lake!! Smoking area is good for talks and no load music, main venue has a long bar with friendly and sexy barkeepers."
4,"This place is fun as hell. It can get busy as hell too, but it's fun as hell. I really came for the airport, since I am an aviation nerd. The rest was just a bonus. And while I sort of had to rush through it, in the sake of a schedule, it was great to see and I will be back when I have more time. So, the airport part. You may have seen it on TV. It's pretty neat, seeing the planes take off, land, taxi around. Seeing the vehicles driving around. Seeing the airport go from day to night and back again (like the other exhibits). As an aviation nerd, I greatly appreciate the real airlines and real aircraft types being used. Now, on to the rest - really pretty neat to see Switzerland, Scandinavia, Germany, Hamburg, the USA and others all exemplified in miniature. Trains are what they are focused on, but that's hardly the only thing there. Just keep your eye out for fun little things - emergency vehicles rushing to a scene, dead bodies being fished out of the water with a coffin nearby (seriously), concerts, auto accidents, and various other random stuff. It's fun. U-Bahn and bus are nearby. Price is 12 euro per adult, which is worth it."
4,"Ok, I'm not usually a Starbucks fan, but this location and place is awesome. The building and location are super, super, super. So pretty. As an American, I sometimes miss flavors from home. Sometimes it is lovely to taste a soy Chai Tea latte. Or banana bread. Or something that is loaded with chocolate and an insane amount of calories and just tastes American. What better way to enjoy those flavors than in a beautiful Altbau building right on the Alster?The barristas were--gasp!--friendly, seemed to have been well-versed in American culture.The secret is out--this is a great place to go to for a get-away from the stress of German life."

Nachdem wir uns hingetzt hatten, wurden zwei Karten mit den Worten Auch was essen? auf den Tisch gelegt. Wir haben dann ewig gesessen und darauf gewartet, dass jemand die Bestellung entgegen nimmt. Vergebens! Nach 15 Minuten sind wir dann aufstanden und gegangen. In diese Kommerz - Tempel war ich das letzte Mal. Schließlich haben wir dann zwei Straßen weiter in der Behringstraße die Taverna Sotiris gefunden - Ein Traum!"
4,"Fantastic burgers!!! Hands down one of the best I've had. The burgers are cooked very well (I recommend medium) with lots of flavors from the portables mushrooms and spinach. Highly recommend the Truffel burger with 1 patty (about 8 euros) with the pale ale beer (about 3.8 euros). The Pommes are excellent as well, you can get 1 to share. Definitely try it out!"
3,"Tiny little fish place. I had a mixed plate that was quite tasty. It's very ""mom and pop"" with just one lady doing all the work. Beware you will smell like fried fish if you dine in. Great for a light meal (by German standards!) and quick too, they also have takeaway options too."
4,"Best Greek food in the city!Run by the real Greeks who put their hearts not only to the food but also to welcoming the guests and giving the best experience possible! I have visited a few Greek restaurants in HH and this is far the best one. The meat is fresh, well seasoned and never dry. Gyros and calamaris are my personal favorites. The portions are large and the prices are low :)"
2,"Fun, airy, Moderate.  Told myself I didn't go to Germany to eat Italian, much less at a chain, but after several days of never seen anything remotely green on my plate (ubiquitous potato, one restaurant served me two side dishes of potatoes prepared differently), i needed the vegetables.  DH got roasted vegetables on his pizza, I decided on a spinach pesto pizza.  Slices of heaven.  Salty, though.  Did you know heaven was high in sodium?  Drank a gallon of water, but water is good for you.You go station to station.  Pay at the end, it's added to this card you are given upon entering.Very brightly lit.  Communal tables, but no one talks to each other.  Often crowded.  Potted basil and rosemary plants on the tables."
1,The bar is situated in the heart of eimsbüttel. The interior is nice and cosy with lovely vintage sofas. Unfortunately we were disappointed by the cocktails. We had a Gin Fizz which quite frankly had no fizz and a Mojito which was nothing more than ok. I do hope that the coffees served are nicer as it's a lovely little place.
3,Tasty and fair prices. One of my favourite places for sushi in hamburg!
2,Went there for lunch with some colleagues and had the Tiki Burger with baked potatoes and a coke light.The meal arrived quickly in under 10 minutes.The Burger was good but not in my top 10 and the baked potatoes could be a little bit more crispy.The price for the  meal and one drink was 12 Euro and they allow to split the bill.
1,"A real dissapointment!We had the 400 gr Western Steak today. Inspite of the fact that I had asked the waiter, and he had asked the cook, to make me a steak brown and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, what I got was a rubbery piece of meat, that was cooked a low heat, had no brown crust on the outside, nor was it juicy on the inside, and just not good at all. No way they will get me back here. Friendly service does not help when the food is lousy! What a shame"
4,"Love this place ~ reminds me of street food in Asia. Great food, friendly staff, quick service, must try if you are looking for great Vietnamese food :0)"
2,Not sure how this place got such high ratings. We made reservations since we heard it was highly recommended to reserve a table. My husband is a vegetarian and his co-workers told him about the restaurant. Just about everything on the menu had either mushrooms (which I dislike) or eggplant (not a big fan). We ordered a Tassajara Ice Tea which was bitter and not to our liking but we forced it down. I wished I had gotten juice or the Mango Lassi. My husband ordered the mix salad and I ordered the soup. The soup arrive hot and in a rather big bowl for German standards. I was hopeful the Eggplant Curry would be spicy and flavoured but it left a lot to be desired. It was bland and the only bright spot was that it arrived hot. The side salad and rice was tasty but nothing to get excited about. We decided to pass on desserts although they did look rather tasty.
4,"It is delicious,,,not so expensive and absolutely clean...Best Asia Imbiss in Hamburg..."
4,"I have a fairly high bar for a food establishment to get a 5-star rating. I don't eat out a ton but, when I do, it's with the expectation of having an experience that I couldn't easily replicate at home (for half the cost and no travel time).We went to TrüffelSchwein to celebrate Valentine's Day. Even though it fell on a Sunday (when they're normally closed), they opened up for the special day and had a custom menu going. The dishes were mostly pulled from their regular menus with some customizations here and there. Still, points for opening on Sunday and printing a themed menu.Ambience: perfect. The dining room is intimate but gives each table enough room to have its own conversation. They have an outdoor space, but it was (1) February in Hamburg and (2) pouring rain. I'm sure it's amazing in the summer, though. The decor is relaxed upscale, not that I'm-rich-look-at-me feel that you'll find in most other Michelin-rated restaurants in Hamburg. It's classy yet comfortable, a nice-jeans-and-blazer vibe. For the occasion, they had rose petals on the tables, a perfectly elegant touch.Service: nailed it. That alone earns them their Michelin star for me. Their timing and delivery are impeccable. They're there to top off your water or wine seconds before you realize you need a refill. The courses are perfectly spaced out and presented. They give you space to enjoy your dining experience but magically show up moments before you even notice you need something. When our waitress heard us speaking English (and clearly butchering any German we spoke with her), she smoothly switched over to English without any hesitation. When we continued in German ('cause we're stubborn fools), she switched back again without missing a beat. Top notch professionalism, folks.Food: everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and superbly plated. We went for the 4-course menu paired with gin martinis and a white wine, which was just the perfect amount. That menu includes a bread basket with truffle butter and tapenade and two amuse-bouches.When it comes to higher-end restaurants, TrüffelSchwein is absolutely worth the splurge, more so than the 185€ you'd have to shell out at Haerlin just for food in my book. I look forward to returning to TrüffelSchwein in the future."
3,"i went there for the first time on the Tanz in den Mai night!Entrance fee was just 2EURdrinks were rather cheaphowever it was so full with sweaty smelly dancing-elbow-to-elbow drunk people. They played 80s music... although im not a fan of that genre, it was ok. A lot of michael jackson for my taste, but i enjoyed itbut there was no place for us to standhowever turns up there is a second floorwe went up there and it was very pleasant.Different style of music, mostly commercial music and house (not very actual songs, but very danceable) there is also a bar - and a bathroom - in the 2nd floor. If you're ever there, keep in mind: there is a less crowded second floor :)"
4,"Original koreanisches essen, wirklich sehr gut! Auch das sushi ist zu empfehlen. Also nicht von der betagten Einrichtung abschrecken lassen, das essen ist klasse."
4,"Absinthe is certainly something different. Run by a couple who had been ""talking about setting up an Absinthe bar for 6 years"", they got around the legal issues of selling such poison a year ago, and are now living the dream. There's something very odd about this place. The ambiance is almost out of a vampire film, and quaffing copious quantities of the green stuff only amplifies it. The selection of spirits is extremely comprehensive. I would guess they basically have everything, and serve it in style. You could also take a beer here, but why would you? If I had to pick holes (apart from the ones in the walls!), I'd be that the seating is not conducive to curling up and going to sleep. I'd imagine this is deliberate! 5/5."
4,"This place definetly is kind of unusual.You have to order at the counter get buzzer and have to pick it up once it is ready. The neighborhood is a bit rough but safer than it appears at first glance so dont't worry to much.The ""restaurant"" itself is also rather simple and focuses on providing good food without any bling bling. The food itself is super awesome if you order a Thali dish you get a metal plate with lentil soup, salad, bread, rice and sauces and everything tastes very good. I mostly get the Palak Paneer and it just tastes greate.This certenly is a hidden gem that is getting popular so it sometimes it is hard to get a seat."
2,"This review is for the Tattoo Exhibit only. Went to the museum today excited to see what would be portrayed about Tattoo history etc. Basically, it was a lot of photographs of modern day tattoo wearers talking about their tattoos. A few old machines in a display box, a ton of tattoo books on a table, and displayed pigments.  The exhibit seemed super touristy in a sense that it was very basic, and maybe curated by someone fascinated by the culture, and not actually a part of it.I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the historic Skin Samples on display. That saved the exhibit. Everything else you can see in the same fashion on the internet. Pictures of pictures etc."
3,A pretty good Indian restaurant considering it's in Hamburg. Handy location right by Mundsberg station on the U3 line.
2,"This is just another bar on the Reeperbahn that you'll never remember the name of after you stumble out in a drunken haze. The only reason I can remember is that I took a photo! On the weekends it's really busy, loads of mental dancing and drunkenness. On the weekdays they have EUR5 cocktails until midnight - not a bad deal."
4,"Really excellent food.  Very nice atmosphere and friendly attentive staff.  Has two menus - Italian and English, both on huge chalkboard.  These are their daily specials.I'd come back!"
4,"Proper Irish  to the point that as an Englishman who grew up in the 70s and 80s I always feel a bit unwelcome. But that is definitely me, not them, so we come here often and if you want guinness, irish stew or great soup it's really good here. They also run a briliant Quiz night and often have irish music going on."
4,"I already passed this bar many times on my way to the schanze. Never went in because of the tight packed crowd.Until last friday, I arrived early, lucky to find seats on the bar! Perfect setting, when you feel like drinking!Around 10oclock it was getting more crowded, which only improved the chill, social atmosphere.A goodlooking dj played funky background sounds, although, unfortunately, this is not the place to dance your night away...Perfect for starting off though!The caiprinhias were amazing, so was the service (only woman...?!), and after some tequilla gold shots I was feeling like I wasnt able to leave this place ever again! Or else...come back for sure! Prices are reasonable, luckily! Another reason I should go back...There was supposed to be an aquarium in the middle of the room (cool!!), I did had some thoughts..but yeah, to be sure, definitely have to come back to have a closer look!"
4,Owner was super friendly and gave us tons of tips about the best way of cooking the meat. The amount of food was really satisfying and as taste as it goes. We will definitely come back.
4,"Sehr stylischer Laden und die Pizza ist auch lecker.Die Pizza ist zum selberkonfigurieren und dann am besten draußen essen und ein bischen Menschen schaun, das ist auf St. Pauli ja immer eher unterhaltsam."
2,The food is good.. but it takes too long to get the food .  Don't go there too hungry! You might start pulling your hair
4,"This is an amazing dining experience, on a ship, water all around, good food. I was told in the summer they have live music on deck which should be even better. There was however jazz music downstairs in the pub, great band, great singing. I'll definitely be going back for the jazz!Awesome fact: My friend I was with is a naval engineer and he commented that this ship must be atleast 60 years old"
3,"Busy little Mexican bistro but inviting to step inside! Menu options are basic but have all the necessary ingredients to get your Mexican taste buds watering. The only thing missing at a glance was fish tacos or a shrimp option. Otherwise it seemed that the more simple the better!They offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. You can order veggie, vegan, tofu, chicken, steak, beef, or even chorizo fillers/toppings along with a variety of typical sides such as rice, beans, cheeses & several sauces. There is a sign that states: If we do not serve you within 10min, you'll be served in 15-20min, we are doing the BEST we can!!! Fair enough, but even with such a warning, the smells and your hunger wear down your patience as you sit feeling famished and eager to eat! The service is so friendly one does not complain, but when your food finally comes to the table, you dig right in!!! The portions are huge and the burritos are fresh & tasty :-) It reminds me of a German version of the U.S chain, Chipotle but without seeming sooo franchisey (I made up that word just now) Order a side of sour cream & salsa then enjoy!!!"
3,"Video link: de.youtube.com/watch?v=P…Sorry! This Scooter piece of rotten fish is definitely one of the worst songs ever. And the video is... what's the comparative degree of worst? Worster? Okay, the video is horrible. And scooter is from Hamburg... Please accept my apologies. But the question How much is the fish? is quite suitable for this place: Fischgroßhandel Karsten Hagenah. Because they sell fish at a rather good price. Fresh fish. And you won't find Unhygienix there (we call him Verleihnix)..."
4,"At monday late lunchtime interesting beverages  price okay. Don't forget to look at the blackboard. Chicken and summer rolls good quality and tasty. Very nice service , created special meal for our little one. If you want to sit outside space is limited and during lunchtime expect to wait."
4,A fabulous way to spend a few hours chilling in Hamburg with amazing views of the river. The deck chairs are perfect for relaxing and switching off with a drink. A highlight of our trip.
2,"I came here with a group of 12 last weekend for my friend's going away dinner and drinks celebration. The location, weather and atmosphere were all lovely. After living in Hamburg for seven months, it was a revelation the city had such a lovely spot. It was very crowded, so there was a long wait to get my Falafel burger. Unfortunately, it was expensive (10 Euro), was accompanied by literally 5 potato wedges and it costs about 10 Euro. Similarly the cocktails were expensive and very watery. The group I was with had similar experiences. So skip the food and get a beer instead"
3,"I found this by chance when coming from the station. Nice little place inside the Hamburger Hof. Food was OK, nothing special but I certainly ate it all with no problems. I found the service to be a little slow, but then they were rather busy, and it still was nothing to cry about. Prices are also very reasonable considering the location."
4,"Fabulous food menu changes daily. Today, soup, pasta and chicken and rice with curry tomatoe sauce.  Not a big curry fan but this was fabulous!!!  She sells all kinds of cookbooks too."
2,Everything was decent here- quite good non-dolsot bi bim bap (ie the less expensive option not served in a hot stone bowl) with ample namul sides. Problem is really the pricing- 15 euros for the dolsot option is more like $21 Canadian and that's just not worth it. If I lived in Hamburg and were desperate for Korean I'd make a beeline but I can't see coming back when there are better and cheaper options back home. Service was fast and very friendly.
4,Boys and girls if you like rock music and if you are looking for one of the best rocking pubs in hamburg this is the place to go!
3,"A nice spot for lunch or dinner and will be even better once the new Elbe Philharmonic Hall opens up,.  Carl is actually several restaurants sharing the same building - casual bistro, a more formal brasserie, and a private room and bar downstairs.  Went here for a group dinner at the Brasserie, and ordered a special 3 course dinner for 39 euros.  Each of the courses was well-prepared -  a salad, followed by steak, and then creme burlee, but perhaps not the most exciting preparations.  But the service and atmosphere made for a very enjoyable evening."
3,"This place is always packed with young people. Very nice atmosphere and extremely cheap coffee. You can buy there soft drinks, snacks and cakes too."
4,Great little place! Could easily compete with high end burger places in the US. The owner was super nice as well. The doctor had a Banksy style to it. Go here if you are craving a quality modern burger.
4,"We have a 1 year old that's constantly moving, so lately we've been getting a lot of meals to go. We went in on Sunday, a little after 9 am. Oma's staff was super nice when we asked for the food to go and also got us coffee while we waited. I've not been impressed with some of the  coffee I've tried so far in the neighborhood, but this was wonderful. I really liked the restaurant itself. Just laid back and cozy. Would've loved to actually stay and eat there if not for the toddler. I'm sure it would've been fine if we had stayed, but it's just not fun for us to eat and chase him at the same time. The food itself was great. Pancakes/maple syrup and Breakfast 1. Exactly what we wanted on a Sunday morning."
3,Been here twice and the fish was great. Very fresh. Great view of the River Elbe. Service was good and prices reasonable.
4,Really good vegan breakfast foods! I had the scrambled tofu and my girlfriend had the blueberry pancakes and it was both delicious! We had to wait a little bit to get a seat and to get our food but the tasty food makes up for it. Definitely bring some time and hunger!
4,"Not often does one feels ""OMG! This is so much food (also tasty ;)) for such less money!"" It happened to me and my friend last night. The food was only more than sufficient for the two of us (we eat a lot, trust me!). It was spicy enough, tasty and appetizing. The service was okay and the ambience was decent. The place might not be romantic but you'd definitely want to romance the food they serve ;) I would definitely go there again and recommend it to any food lover, who loves spicy food :)"
2,Discent burger restaurant whom also serve a salads - the Cesar salad comes without any chicken so you have to order that on the side (well most of the salads is without protein :-))Would have loved to taste there dessert unfortunately there where no hot chocolate left when we finished our main course. They have home made drinks (non alcoholic) which is very good.
1,"Very disappointed having made this a ""must do"" evert time I'm in town. The service was good. The lobster bisque Ok, and the penne beef pasta boring flat and not worth eating. My colleague ordered a gin and tonic and couldn't finish it. We ordered the tiramisu and there wasn't the hint of liquor in it - ""safe for all ages"". Not what I want from one of my favorite desserts."
3,"It's cheap, but not like the bird.  What can i say except, i don't know what to say. Have you ever noticed that the English language reviews in Hamburg don't give you any useful information?"
2,"Update: I have to take this place down a notch. They are now vegetarian and everything which used to include meat now has some kind of tofu replacement or isn't on the menu anymore. This definitely takes them down a notch when it comes to many breakfast options.....bacon.....you can't take away bacon folks! It's a god-given right!Had breakfast here this morning with a friend and business partner and came away pleasantly surprised. There have been a lot of comments all over the place both on Yelp and Qype about this place. I had been at ""Don't Tell Mama"" in their previous location and really liked the cheesecake but service sucked and the location was a hassle for me. Had meant to come here forever but finally had the chance. I am finnicky about breakfast and very few places in Hamburg do it right. Mamalicious did a pretty good job. The eggs benedict were quite good as was a 3-egg scramble (with dried tomatoes and feta cheese). Coffee was tasty too. I had a fruit smoothie which was so so but I think it was more the mix of fruit verses anything else that didn't let it shine. All in all a nice location with outdoor seating as well (does get loud due to busy street right there). Service was really nice but we were first ones in the door in the morning and it wasn't that busy. Unfortunately, hash browns were out. No idea how something is already out right at opening and found this a bit odd but so be it. All in all we were happy with breakfast and enjoyed the place. I plan on coming back and hope not to find all the gripes which have been mentioned: too loud music, slow service nor missing food items, etc. This place is good but could very easily tip over to mediocre. As long as you get good service and they have everything available you should be happy with this place. Prices are a bit steep too but hopefully you're getting quality for that and they do use organic products (or so they say) and mention having a local, quality butcher for their meat. Let's hope that the second visit is just as good if not better."
1,"We were walking around looking for somewhere for a quick snack and popped in to this cool looking restaurant. After ordering food and drinks we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. There where 5 other occupied tables and three waitresses but nothing seemed to happen. I started timing. Ten minutes after we ordered, we were told the drinks they would be with us shortly. They arrived five mins later with the food. (Quick tip: ALWAYS bring the drinks ASAP and ALWAYS before the food- that way it's more likely that a second drink will be ordered; thus making more money and maybe more tips.)The food however was good and the portions large but nothing out of this world. Cute inside. Quite highly priced but OK if you're not expecting much. Large terrace and a good place to ""be seen"" if thats what you're into.Wouldn't  recommend too highly."
4,"By reputation it's the best Italian restaurant in Hamburg. I have to agree. Great food, good service, feels authentic and costs an arm and a leg. Looks a bit ropey, and is nestled between all the working girls of Davidstrasse. Apparently it's been here for many decades, long may it continue.Book early if you want to go on the weekend."
3,"IMHO so far the best Portugese Restaurants in Hamburg I have tried! The only drawback is that it is way too crowded and therefore the waiters tend to be stressed out. Make a reservation! The food is definitely worth it! Nice ambiance too! Don't spread the word, its toocrowded already ;-) Ok others are obviously not on the same page with me here, but try the Cataplanas (copper bowlswith simmered seafood) You didn' t like it here? Good. More space for the rest of us."
3,"Young, fresh, cozy as well as dynamic place.Very good and friendly service.We had poached eggs with avo, pesto, spinach on bread. Delicious!Waffle, other bread and dishes look perfect as well.Coffee (espresso and cappuccino) were excellent.The home made maracuja lemonade was just refreshing WOW!One star reduction, as we wait for 30 minutes (ok, I didn't know before). Reservation online only and no table free the next two weeks.In general perfect for the business. However not for spontaneous brunch people."
2,"This big, bustling restaurant is a good place for a comfortable, casual meal with friends. Food is good--nothing memorable, but something for everyone.  Service can be a little challenged at times, but when that happened to us once, before we could even consider complaining, they were right up front with an apology and offer of free after dinner coffees/drinks.  Any restaurant can have an off night, few will acknowledge it, and that gets points from me."
4,"Believe it or not, this is the best place for university students and everyone else alike.  I bring up university because you remember how tough it was back in school to eat healthy, a good size portion, and for a good price, right?!  I rate this levels above Campus Suite for quality, because most people from school do not know about this lunch spot and end up eating at Campus Suite if they go off campus away from the Mensa (cafeteria food at school).Well this place solves all that and does it in good timing to boot! This spot is totally worthy of a five star rating!  Every type of person comes here and enjoys returning because they have a great lunch special.  Usually it is some fish or pasta of the day and it tastes so good and costs 6€ was what I paid for a tagliatelle fresh pasta with creamy tomato sauce, grilled wild salmon with herbs, and freshly grated parmesan cheese with cracked pepper to add the final touches.   If you do not have to be at work or at school within the hour, once can also stop in here and have a glass of wine.  Most of the space is standing limited, but if you can get a window seat at the bar, its nice to watch everyone walk by on the Colonnaden above. since the restaurant is located below ground level. Specialty meals can change depending on what fish or pasta they have on hand during different times, which is a nice reason to return here regularly."
4,"Wild experience.  I got to the museum an hour before it closed, which was not enough time.  I would recommend 2.5 hours to look around the extensive exhibits - especially considering they are open very late.  It seems a little pricey, but is well worth it.  There are different rooms dedicated to towns around Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.  You can also see offices where people are building the models.  I would recommend the place even if you do not have a special interest in trains!"
2,"I had such high hopes for Cafe Mexico but alas it was a bit of a let down. The service is ok, very nice, even though our server was slow with the drinks and spilled a whole plate of creamy enchiladas all over our coats. That was something I'll never forget, I don't think my coat will either. The menu seemed to have a lot of choices but in actuality it did not. It just a lot of repetition and white space. Mexican food is one of my favorites so I knew what to expect and I was not expecting what was put down in front of me. Once I got my food, it was extremely cold, as if they had the kitchen in another building and walked it over in the dead of winter. Even though they told me mine would take a few minutes longer because it had to cook longer it was actually one of the first dishes to come out. I might give this place another chance but I am not rushing back there anytime soon. I will just have to hang my sombrero and wait until I come across a real, authentic Mexican experience."
0,"Went here as it was the closest to the hotel. Very disappointed. Got a steak that had the texture of being boiled, and wuite chewy. No effort from staff to correct or even take it of the bill although I hardöy had a bite from it. Will not be coming back. Ever."
4,"An intimate wine bar with a lovely menuA short convenient walk from an M2 bus stop, I had a very pleasant evening in this wine bar which seems to have a very dedicated local clientele.  I had a salad and soup--both were extremely tasty and the recommended wine to accompany was superb.  The staff was friendly and kind and welcoming to an American on a business trip."
4,Comfortable and minimalistic place with a cozy atmosphere. Friendly waitress and nice coffee and chai latte. Definitely recommendable for a quick pitstop during shopping!
0,"DIRTY place! Both me and my friend found medium length human hair in our dishes, and we even had different dishes. When we told the staff, they were really cold and didn't apologize to both of us, just my friend. Also, when we were leaving, they sort of ignored us and didn't even say goodbye. Basically, they made us feel guilty for their own mistake and it felt like they just wanted us to leave asap. The little food we ate was average, and even if we hadn't found the hairs, I doubt we would have ever gone  back there. Avoid !"
4,"What a unique and fascinating experience we had at Miniatur Wunderland! It is simply incredible to see the excitement and enthusiasm in the eyes of the children and their parents, while wondering through the Mini-World. So many little details to see and discover, all kinds of dramas and events have been carefully put into life in America, in Hambourg, at Frankfurt-Airport, in Berlin, in Switzerland, Austria or Italy ...! hours are not enough to really take in all one can contemplate in Miniatur Wunderland! We loved it, and will definitely go there again!"
4,"One of my favourite Döner places in town. Specifically, I find the service to be super nice. This seems to be family run or at least the folks there have been working together for a while. The food has always impressed us and we personally like the taste. We actually come a bit out of our way to eat here as we don't live in the area. When we are up for a Döner Teller, my wife and I jump in the car to come get one here. They have the standard selection like every other Döner Imbiss but the folks are always nice and there is plenty of traffic in here so that nothing in the store has time to go bad. Further, they make their bread fresh in the store and it's usually still warm from the oven and super tasty. I'm sure everyone has their favourite place when it comes to Döners but this one is ours because of the people. If in the area, stop in and try it out. They have outdoor seating as well for the warmer weather months."
3,Old pharmacy transformed into a student pub. Like the vibe and comparatively low prices. Main drink is beer.
3,"Went there for lunch with some colleagues and we had the daily special. It's 2 course meal and a drink.The 2 courses were crepes , one was savory and one was sweet. It was delicious and costed just 8.40 Euro.Only bad thing: I'm still a little bit hungry."
2,"pretty good food, decent service.we had a pizza - good, lasagna - not good, a few salads - good, and a pasta special of the day with chanterelle mushrooms - amazing.we were greeted warmly at the door by, seemingly, the owner.we did experience long wait times after that though, but maybe that's just the culture ?"
3,"If the lamb is on special and you are an eater of lamb, I implore you to take it. This is the reasoning I used and left highly sated in terms of red meat levels and happiness factor. The service was lovely, especially in regards to keeping wine glasses full, explaining the menu (going the extra kilometer to explain in english the specials), providing quick translations and overall just being very pleasant and excited about the experience. My lamb with veggies in a mint/thyme sauce was elegantly plated and the taste surely matched the looks. A medium portion, just enough to fill up but not be overly full. The cinnamon rice I snagged from across the table was also quite a treat...savory sweet. We had a range of appetizers, the standouts being the falafel and the red beet paste. The dipping sauces for the bread were a bit bland, and the other starters quite small (more like tapas, but smaller) so a bit hard to split amongst the group easily. A lovely dinner for our group of 7. Half German, half American. All happy. *reservations suggested. *cash or German EC only. Total: 200 euros with tip. Not bad at all for the quality and panache of the evening."
3,"Good steak house. They have large fresh salads, and the garlic bread is awesome. But the steaks are lean, well prepared, and the service is good for a German restaurant - which means efficient but not overly friendly, and certainly not casual. They have some nice beers on taps, and a rather good selection of wine as well. They serve deserts, but I prefer to go to some place else like a nice coffee shop to have a pot of tea and maybe some straddle. Or to one of the awesome chocolate shops around. I eat here every time I am in Hamburg."
3,"If you want yummy pierogis, vodka and a great location in north St. Pauli, this is the place to go."
3,"Carrywurst, beer result in philosophical reflections), matchless Ceazar salat!"
3,"I met a friend for dinner the other night and we had a great time. We decided to share a pizza (because they are enormous) and salad and decided of half Hawaiian / half spicy sausage. When the pizza came, it was already cut in two with half of each kind on a plate for both of us. Man, Germans think of everything!The restaurant was quite busy on a Thursday evening but we managed to get a table in just a minute or two. You can grab a hefeweizen at the bar while you wait.Overall, I think the Yelpers are spot on about this place: a solid 3.5+ stars for pizza, salad, and beer. I'm rounding up to 4 because the waitress brought me an English menu without me having to bear the embarrassment of asking. Danke schoen!"
4,"Amazing coffee and extremely friendly baristas. Pour over coffees are superb and the cafe has amazing views of the canal. What is not to love about this place? On my second visit, I got wild and tried the food. No surprise, it was also incredible! I had the poached egg with spinach and avocado served on a huge loaf of fresh bread, all topped with coriander-basil pesto. Be still my heart! If you are close - come here, if not still come here."
4,"I can't say enough about this place! We had lunch there yesterday and had to go back again today!  The waiters were super friendly and spoke multiple languages. Our waiter spoke German, Italian, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The food is seriously better than a lot of the food I had in Italy!  The bruschetta, burrata, and the pizza with prosciutto and parmigiano was amazing!  They do have some funky dishes that were equally delicious if you like that sort of thing. It is very small and a bit dark inside. Sitting outside is definitely the best, but it does get packed. I would recommend going at like 12 for lunch or 6 for dinner to beat the crowds.  If you want Italian in Hamburg, this is the place to go!!"
4,"Miniatur Wunderland is the entire reason I visited Hamburg.  There are not words that can adequately describe how amazing and enjoyable Miniiatur Wunderland is.  We spent almost the entire day there, and it wasn't long enough.If you don't know what it is, it is the world's biggest ""model railroad"", but it is SO much more!  There are full replicas of entire cities with a level of detail that is second to none.  All of the vehicles are fully automated, day changes to night every 15 minutes, vehicles respond to emergencies (vehicle fire in a tunnel, for example), airplanes take off and land, and there are TONS of hidden items all over the place.  NOTE TO PRUDES: Yes, there are naked figurines, some engaging in sexual activity.  This is not gratuitous or widespread, and where present, is very much tongue-in-cheek.  Germans are FAR more open and accepting of the human body and not treating it in a shameful fashion as is more common in America.When you go (which you MUST), be sure to purchase the ""behind-the-scenes"" tour.  It is money well-spent, and gives you lots of insider information and access to some interactive parts of the exhibit that are only accessible by those on the tour.  The tours are available in English, and go by VERY quickly.  If I go again, i may book two just to I can spend more time in the second part on the pieces about which I had more questions.Bring a camera, and lots of extra batteries and memory cards or tapes (if you're still using old technology), but be sure to enjoy and savor the experience in person.  Spend the whole day, too."
1,"Had dinner here with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. Tasted good, but messed up our plumbing. Won't be coming here anymore! Unless you're ok with a tummy ache after. Good luck!"
4,"So I have had some good Italian meals and last night we came here as a work group and some visitors from out of town. This experience was pretty special.We all went for the taster menu and the whole thing was just fantastic.15 year old super viscous Balsamic vinegar, extra first pressed Sicilian olive oil, angel hair spaghetti with truffles, carpaccio of smoked tunafish, melt in the mouth Tiramisu great wine, and really good service.A really good place to enjoy incredible Sicilian Italian food outside on a warm evening. Not the cheapest, but one of the best."
0,"This place is a no go.They might look like an Italian restaurant, they might act like an Italian restaurant, and they even actually be an Italian restaurant - just a really bad one. Maybe it's the lack of restaurants around or maybe it's just because they are just not good at what they do - they forgot the Italian hospitality and service.How come all the reviews are praising this place?!?!We came here in the afternoon, quite a big group and had a table reserved for us, the menu is a bit confusing as it's full of ads and weird articles.I really felt like having bolognese which is a must in Italian restaurants and they didn't have it, not in the menu and not in the specials. In addition - I had to ask twice for everything (took them 15 minutes to bring my very-not-tasty-from-cheap-syrup Apple juice.My pasta dish was very small, so small I left the place hungry, and not even offered me some Parmesan cheese.One positive thing - the garlic Aioli, which is great."
3,"It's not the most intimate or convivial décor - it's very ""hotel-y"".The staff are extremely attentive and helpful.Absolutely excellent gin and tonics, and their bar has an impressive selection.The burgers are some of the best I've had so far in Germany (...not as good as a *really good* burger in America, but very tasty) and the allumette (""matchstick"") fries are a little crispy, salty, delicious cone-full of heaven. Can't wait to try their selection of various proteins tartare (next time!). It's pricey - good for a treat.Edit:  I've had the steaks here once or twice now, too. The meat is high quality, but drastically suffers from typical German under-seasoning. I'd stick with the burgers."
4,"Olympisches Feuer doesn't look like much from the outside. The sign looks like a pretty bad relic from the 80s and the menu - superficially - looks even worse. However, don't judge a book by it's cover Olympisches Feuer does some of the best food in the Schanze and does it at a great price. I recommend the Gyros mit Metaxasousse. Yum. On Saturday afternoons they normally do the lunch menu until 3pm, and then you can stay and watch the German football on the flatscreens!"
4,"If you ever want to take friends out in Hamburg, make sure you visit this place first. The setting of within the gay area Talstraße with its drag-prostitutes might be a bit unusual at first but the 3-zimmer-wohnung totally makes up for it. The interior is amazing, the bar staff very friendly and the prices cheap! They have special evenings where a guy reads poems and short stories in German, which is quite entertaining and the foosball basement hosts various tounaments.Oh, and the ancient dildo collection is a must-see! Apparently they found this sealed room underneath the bar and when they broke it open, they found all these old dildos. They put them in display cabinets around the foosball tables. Go and check them out!"
4,"I might have found a new favorite coffee place in Hamburg! They seem to roast their own coffee and it actually tastes really good. We had an Americano and a Cappuccino. Both tasted aromatic. Their waffles are famous, so we had to try one with Nutella and were not disappointed! Their cheesecakes are very good as well! I almost liked it more than their waffles. It's a nice place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon with friends and family."
2,"Started out with the pork+prawn spring rolls, very tasty, although oily. Tried the beef and chicken pho. The broth was ok, but had to add some Sriracha for a bit more flavor. The lemonades (traditional and raspberry) were nice presented and refreshing! Small space inside with tables close to each other, a wall covered with pictures from Vietnam and music playing in the background. The staff was very friendly, the food came quick, even though it was crowded. Wouldn't come back for the pho, but would definitely try more items from the menu."
2,"Solid cheap buffet. Fairly fresh, nothing too spicy, nothing too inventive. Easy to fill up here on the cheap so you don't need to eat too heavily or expensively later (if you're trying to be a budget savvy tourist). The chicken tandoori and the chicken curry were prepared well; the meat was very tender. I thought their saag was interesting - when I took my first plate it had potatoes in it, and the second time it had broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and carrot. I will say those were unusual. I'm forgetting pretty much all the other dishes since there was nothing remarkable. There was a fried veggie thing, some slightly overcooked white rice, some other veggie dishes. The mango pudding turned out to be more like an orange colored liquid sugar as I couldn't taste any mango. Not my scene. But all in all it was worth the savings to go this route and I'm glad we did. The grated coconut and sliced almond topping bowls were a nice touch. It was a pity the fresh herb was parsley and not cilantro, but we can't all be perfect."
4,"This is the new branch of the well known Hamburg based burger chain, featuring the famous Blockhouse Burger.The place I often have been to on Jungfernstieg is just too hammered and busy to be fun anymore, so coming here was a real treat. So it's the usual Jim Block quality and service, but with added comfort, plus free gifts for the kids.Very nice."
4,"It's refreshing to see a kebab shop that is always packed full of people! This bustling little place is the closest I've seen to a kebab place merging with a bar. The staff are really funny, and always seem to make up a randomly lower price than the menu. When you ask for beers they fill up a carrier bag with load without enquiring as to how many you wanted! I love it. Food wise there's a massive selection of healthy stuff, including a lot of roasted veg, humous, rice, unleven bread etc. You won't get bored... ... and the killer factor? It's at the end of my road. Mr. Kebab  Dubara. Fact.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=D7Nx…"
3,"So good I went 2x in 5 days. The best falafel - light fresh and crispy, an amazing array of fresh salads, hummus and spreads. I couldn't read the menu so I just asked the guy behind the counter to make me something he liked -  I think it was the falafel doner with all the fixings & it was a good choice. :) Quality food for 5 Euro & a tasty meal that would be just as good late night as it would be for lunch."
3,"Ay Carumba! Casa Franco is so much fun. I came here last night with some friends and I had a great time. For 27 euros you get a four-course meal complete with a flaming scallop starter, fish, more fish, and a delicious dessert. Mmm. The owner of the restaurant is fantastic. He's so attentive to his customers and makes a huge effort to entertain the entire restaurant. We got several free shots of alcohol and the entire restaurant toasts together. The atmosphere is cozy, festive, and lively. There was even a traditional guitar singer that serenaded us twice in the night. My favorite part of my four course meal was the parrot fish and the crème brûlée-like dessert. I'm not sure what it was, but it was GOOD. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was 22 euros a bottle. I'd say the style of the food was Portuguese fusion. The fun part is that the chef decides what you will eat so you don't have to order your food. The fish that he served us was extremely fresh. I think this is a great place to go with some friends or to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday. At the end of the meal, the owner also gives the ladies a single rose. :) Four solid stars for the food, and 7 stars for the service. I'll most likely be back!"
4,"Due to the very good yelp reviews, we decided to have dinner at this restaurant. Believe me... this restaurant is excellent!!!! You should definitely try the fish dishes! The restaurant is very central and close to the Alster. Inside the restaurant decoration is cozy and very welcoming. The service was excellent. She was always checking if we have everything and if we need anything. Very friendly and communicative.My husband and I decided to order a fish dish.The plaice was served with little shrimps, roast potatoes and side salad. It was soooooo DELICIOUS!!! The portion was really good. We are excited to go there again pretty soon!"
3,"Barley & Malt is an Irish pub in the center of Hamburg at the Deichstraße close to the building where the great fire started in 1842. The street is very nice and it is possible to sit outside in the summer. The interior and the decoration are similar to most Irish pubs I have been to. The TV screens show football, rugby or cricket.  The pub offers several snacks and small dishes. I only tried the Nachos which tasted good.To access the pub you need to go up some stairs."
4,As a UNESCO World Heritage site the warehouse district shouldn't be missed. If you're anything like me and have a thing for bridges in architecture you'll be a happy camper. I love walking around and seen the locks on the bridges and the views down the canals. Read up on some of the history about the warehouse district and how it came to be a UNESCO heritage site. There's some great spots for pictures and just to get a nice walk in.
0,"Stopped in late for a beer and a burger.  Sat at the bar.  Placed our order with hip punk-rock waiter guy and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.  Enjoyed watching the staff eat their food further down the bar while we waited... and waited... and waited.  Finally, after a while we told our waiter that we couldn't wait any longer.  He told us to hold on and that he'd check our food's status in the kitchen.  He came back out and wouldn't make eye contact with  us. Douche.So, the food could have been good, but we never found out.  The service was ass."
4,"Have been coming here for many years - simple, excellent food.   My only complaint is that the price for the Normandy-Cider has become sort of crazy.     A small noise about a restaurant which remains high on my list.   Recommended for sure, especially for foreigners who think Flammkuchen is some variation of Pizza! (pfffffft!)"
2,"Food is okay, but everything is on the pricey side. Very interesting spot for a cosy italian restaurant. Always very busy amd very hard to get them on the phone in order to book a table. Best to just show up there and maybe wait 10mins for a table to open up. Despite it being hectic, the personnel do try their best and keep smiling."
3,"Cute place for a breakfast, lunch or dinner... Very friendly associates"
3,A great local bar - nice clientele and owner. Good select of beers. A great place for a night out. Smoky though - like most German bars
3,"Good place for a few drinks Nice Sofas (best for smaller groups of 3/4 on the one couch - bit difficult to talk across them) Or there's plenty of room to stand or take a stool at tables near the bar. Reasonable prices, enough room There's benches outside as well if you'd rather that in the summer"
4,"The seat of the ""Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg"", this building is on the Rathausmarkt square. Constructed between 1186 and 1897, this is also the seat of one of the 16 state parliaments of Germany. Government still operates from here.I did not have time for a proper tour of the building, but the next time I am in Hamburg, I absolutely will do so. The lobby is open to the public and you can get to a few other places if the parliament is not actually in session.[Review 12060 overall, 1843 of 2019.]"
3,Great place for German food close to everything in Hamburg.  We had two people get the pork shank for dinner and it was excellent (a little fatty). The beer was good and the prices were good. Great value for the money. I would definitely recommend if you are spending any time in Hamburg.
4,"My favourite Italian restaurant ever. Reasonable prices, great menu and great service. Some of the best service I've had in Germany - not that there's much competition."
2,"This place is basically OK if you're up for pizza. I can't complain about the taste and size-wise it's nice and big. I actually managed not to finish mine yesterday which is a rarity for me. I was eating my dinner date's dish along for her though so that's my excuse. I find even at night that place is priced well but everything is very basic. The house wine is not all that good so there goes a star. Further, sitting inside at the front or outside is good but the back room is pretty dreary in my opinion. Finally, while we were there, only one waiter was working and he was busy. Service was very slow although the guy was quite nice. If in the area and up for a pizza, a good place to stop in. I wouldn't hump over here though extra to check this place out. One final positive note: when you pay, you get a shot of either grappa or something sweet. We chose the grappa."
4,"Absolute professional and lovely, remembers most customers favourite orders, makes good jokes and even has some books for kids."
3,"Very good brunch with homemade marmalade, pesto and tiny pieces of delicious cheesecake! The staff is very friendly. I went there on a Sunday so it was very crowded in the small Coffee shop.I like to go there again."
3,"We went there for early dinner on our last night in Germany. The place was packed though the food came out at reasonable time. We ordered medium spicy chicken wings for starter. It was good but very spicy for us so we suggest if you want mild, choose the bbq variety instead. For the main course we had hickory bbq burgers served with fries on the side. The buns were brioche so it's softer than the usual burer buns. For dessert, we had hot fudge sundae which is my favorite. It taste better than it looks! My bf had a beer while I got a .75l of water. Our bill came at around €60. It costs more than our usual budget but we enjoyed the food anyway and it's our last day in our Germany vacation. It is not a quiet restaraunt. And don't expect so much if you want to be seated by the window with a nice view. I am not sure if they accept table booking because the feature on the website was not working when we tried."
3,"Near the Hbf in Hamburg and it's worth a short walk for a 4 euro meal, and 5 if you get an Ayran! Durum is like a giant burrito with chicken and beef, assorted veg and sauce. Ask for ""scharf"" or spicy and it has a nice little kick. Is it a 4 star meal? Not even close, but for a fast and filling meal before hopping on a train or after a stadtrundfahrt this is a deal. You could even split a durum and it would fill up two people and save even more money! I'm not on a budget, but I liked what I found here. Enjoy!"
0,"Coffee time should be a time to relax, reflect, chat or read (it helps if you're enjoying a good coffee too!)Balzundbalz doesn't seem to buy into. Common sense seems in short supply here! Today's visit was my worst experience in a cafe. Ever.I ordered from a nice gentleman and told him we were outside (regretfully I also left a 20% tip!) Then we ordered a water for our son. However, just as our drinks were being prepared we were told by a member of staff that we had to move the the pushchair (although our son was still in it, not wanting to be held!) onto a grass verge across from the footpath and the cycle path! The reason being...it was an obstruction. There was enough space on the footpath for a pedestrian or push chair to pass and also the cycle lane was not obstructed. As another customer that left shortly afterwards said: ""I don't see what the problem is! There's plenty of room!"" Furthermore, the design agency next door were sat outside on benches and tables having lunch - this was in a narrow part of the street and would cause more of an obstruction to pedestrians. A little common sense could go a long way - if we were politely seated elsewhere (we had taken up position well in advance to buying out drinks funnily enough!), dealt with in a courteous manner, or even apologized to over the rude brashness of the staff member I wouldn't take issue. If you would like your coffee served with a slice of over zealous officiousness then this is a perfect cafe! Fine, you don't want to lose your right to outdoor seating, it's easy to quote: ""we need to keep a distance of 1,5m from a cycle lane"", rather than deal with improving the customer experience. On the other hand, if you would like a coffee, peace, tranquility and good service - move along. There are many parents and babies in Eppendorf and this cafe is certainly not baby friendly (it's not friendly full-stop!) so I'd strongly advise heading to one of the other many cafes nearby. With regards the coffee...the cappuccino was all milk and no coffee and the long black was ""meh"" at best. It's a shame that the service and coffee aren't what you come to expect; the location is fantastic."
4,The best place to stay in Hamburg when the sun is shining. I love it
4,"Ah, vegetarian friends. Who'd have them? Not me for one! But on occasion I do have few visiting couchsurfers with an aversion to meat. For these moments, Azietona is a little gem, which is fortuitously located next to sofabar!"
4,It is a pretty friendly environment with lots of options of coffee and cake-desert mixtures. Even dough there are available place for sitting around 50-70 people you will be in need of waiting a bit(aprox.5-15 min). I tried their late- macchiato - delicious -made of some kind of Rwanda origin beans. Hint: If you sit in those bar chairs a bit later your back hurts so try to get a table sitting option. Pretty good location btw- if you couldnt find anywhere at schanze or before going there after Sternschanze subway station have a break here.Highly recommended.
4,"Very refined mom and pop shop with a limited but delicious menu that has all the Hamburg classics. I reserved a table via email three weeks before Mother's Day to get a spot for dinner with my family. A little old school but I can respect it. We came in and filled the last table-the place was already so lively at 6:30 on a Sunday (Mother's Day). They have English menus and were (of course) offering an asparagus specialty menu. We went with a couple beers, a shandy, a Schnitzel, mixed fish plate and the whole fish. Everything was so delicious and we could see the singular chef working and the singular woman wait all the tables. The only thing was that the shandy was actually made on site, with sprite and beer from tap. It was an interesting flavor. Would recommend this to anyone to get Hamburg classics!"
0,"I have been a regular customer for the last 2 years of this winebar somehow pleased by the cosy atmosphere of this place and the fact that is located close to where I leave. Friday 30th of July around 8:00 pm me and my gf have decided spontaneously to have a dinner again without booking a table.When we approached the queue a ""very kind"" girl at the entrance gently invited us to seat on a table in front of the entrance.Due to the fact that outside was very windy and cold and the front door was open to allow the people to enter we kindly denied to seat on that table (for the above reasons) asking to sit at the bar to have 1 or 2 drinks (as allowed to the couple in front of us in the queue) while waiting to have another table later on in the evening.Suddenly the girl clearly annoyed by our request has decided to show all the empathy skills acquired in this industry over the years and claimed that if we did not want to sit on that table we should have left the restaurant as they do not like to move people around tables...!!Coming from this business many years and having worked as a waiter during my studies in a multitude of restaurants in different countries it is shocking how you can people can even call this behaviour ""service"".My only request was to have 2 drinks at my expense while waiting for a table to be free later on in the same evening.I used to come to this place once a month with an average expense of 40 euro per person when in 2 and more when with other friends.This is the treatment you can get at the Vineyard in Hamburg even if you are a regular customer and horrifying it is actually a compliment.This is my first bad review I have ever left on Yelps but it is crucial that everybody have a clear picture of the venue you are visiting before deciding to spend the evening and your money.From my side they will never see me again!"
3,"After university my friend and I used to come here for cup of coffee and snack. We really loved sitting outside on their cute small table and chairs on the vibrant and artsy street in Sternschanze.Nice and welcoming decor, attentive staff and delicious food.Definitely come here if you want to have a nice ambiance with friends."
4,"If you're looking for traditional northern German food, Brodersen is definitely a good spot! The interior is also traditional and cozy with a nautical theme. The Pannfisch with the Dijon mustard sauce was quite good, and my partner also really enjoyed the Rumpsteak. I think the highlight was however the Bratkartoffeln... crispy yet soft and fried to perfection! Not the cheapest restaurant but for special occasions definitely a good option! Good for tourists visiting hamburg as well."
4,"Just yummy!Opening times are a bit unusual, and you have to get there early to get a table and/or a certain dish because they only prepare a certain amount of any given dish. They do deliver a few chosen dishes and these are really good!"
4,"A cosy place, next to u2 Hauptbahnhof. From ordering to getting food is just in a short while. Totally in  with their chicken avocado bowl. Absolutely recommend this place for everyday healthy lunch"
4,"If you don't mind that it's quite packed, you'll love the place. The food is excellent and there's a wide choice, the atmosphere is very cozy, and the prices are not too high."
3,Food was good not great! However the ambience was some what comfortable. Staff was kind and prompt.
4,"Für preiswerte 3,70EUR gibt es hier eine Mahlzeit in Form einer gefüllten Backkartoffel. Diese wird mit Kräuterbutter und Käse vermengt und nach Belieben gefüllt. Besonders toll für Vegetarier! Houmus, Couscous und etliche tolle Saucen lassen das Ganzezu einem sehr leckerem und abwechslungsreichem Essen werden. Weil wir eine Zeit lang jeden Tag hier waren, haben wir das ein oder andere Getränk auf's Haus bekommen. Sehr nette Bedienung, obwohl das von Person zu Person ziemlich schwankt Auf die Kartoffel kommt es an! :) auf der Schanze ein Muss!"
4,"I absolutely love and recommend the location for a 'half-decadent' Friday lunch. Food is modern Vietnamese cuisine, the serving process is optimized and even when you see a long queue you will still be seated and served within less than 10 minutes. The staff is extremely friendly. It can be noisy and crowded at times but that's part of the experience too."
4,"Top of the line as far the currywurst I've had in Germany! Really nice guys in here - great service, and all cooked to order. The seating area outside is cool and has a decent patio heater to keep you warm. It's the perfect place for a quick snack before visiting the cinema down the road. Good stuff."
3,"No, not like Duff Beer, it's Dulf's Burger! This joint serves up some amazing meat between buns utilizing a high tech ordering system that you will have to experience yourself. It'll be one of those times where you just wish every restaurant had this system that just makes things easier.I went big with my burger and ordered a special that had everything. I'm talking fried egg, avocado, etc. While it was damn delicious (see the cross section photo I posted), I sort of wish I just went with a straight up cheeseburger to bask in the glory of simple hamburger in Hamburg. The onion rings were good, but I think I would rather have went with the fries.I do think Burgerlich is better than Dulf's, but both are real good in their own ways. Check out both of them while you're in town!"
4,"全汉堡最好吃的pho！ Best beef pho in Hamburg. Came at dinner time, the place is crowded with hipsters. The food was really really great, especially the soup in the pho. It has the rich flavor of beef, or in Chinese ""鲜"". I tried ice green tea this time, it is just ok, but my friends ordered lime ginger soda, she said it was good. Maybe try some other drinks next time."
3,"Don't know why Oma decided to name this place Apotheke, when it is in fact a bar / restaurant, but however bad his marketing skills are there is no doubt he cook some banging food. I played it safe with a tasty French Onion soup inside a bowl made of bread (only ever seen this done previously in Austria), which was gorgeous and more than enough for a meal in its own right. Bargain for the 5EUR it cost me. My fellow dinner guests followed suit, except for one brave soul who plumped for the cheeseburger, which was so big it could have given Chunk (thebestsportsblog.com/im…) a run for his money."
4,"Luhmanns was a pleasant surprise. The tea house was very charming, it had an old world feel. They had a nice selection of teas and cakes. Top notch atmosphere and a very pleasant staff. This was a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
3,A bit over priced I thought but I think that is because of the location. They are right off of the water and across the street from the Westin and the Orchestra House. Outdoor and indoor seating. There are also two parts of this place. One is the brassiere and one was the bistro. I went to the brassiere part. French cuisine and the menu was a little limited. There was steak and pasta basically. I didn't want full meal so I went with the appetizer of Beef Tartar. Nice presentation and it was pretty good. Good for the one visit but not sure if I would be back.
3,"I like this place a lot. We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon not knowing quite what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised. It seems new, the staff is nice, and the food is good.The floor plan is a bit odd... the entrance is alongside the pizza kitchen, with a huge countertop and a giant red oven. Towards the back up a short flight of stairs is the dining room, which probably seats about 40 or 50 people, and is decorated in a minimalist, trendy way with plants growing in gutters along a side wall.The menu is mostly pizza, along with a few appetizers and a few salad options. They also have a pizza-based dessert which is chocolate raviolis made with pizza dough. We didn't try dessert on our first visit, but it will probably happen at some point. There is also a surprisingly long drink menu; everything from coffee and tea to beer and wine, and cocktails to boot.I ordered the special pizza, which was fennel sausage, roasted red pepper strips, and shaved parmesan. My wife had the portobello pizza, which has ricotta instead of tomato sauce, and is topped with mushrooms and truffle oil. Both were delicious and filling. There's a lot of advertising around to tell you this, but these are meant to be Neapolitan-style pizzas which are baked in a 400C oven for 90 seconds. As a result, the pizzas come out mostly cooked, but still a little watery, and the crust never gets terribly crisp. (I don't mind, but apparently this bothers other Yelpers.)In the ""How is it for kids?"" department, our daughter was greeted with a coloring book and a jar full of colored pencils, and when it came time to ordering, we were able to get her a smaller kinder-pizza withOUT (this is the most important part) any green seasoning (oregano) whatsoever. They are very accommodating of picky kids.I liked the vibe a lot, and the food was good. I'll definitely be back."
2,"I was recommended Gazi Antep by friends, but I can't say that I was impressed. Far from it in fact, it seemed like a pretty standard kebab shop with nothing to make it stand out as particularly good. I can't totally remember what I had, but I think it was some kind of doner plate."
3,"many pros: good but inexpensive food, casual but stylish setting, busy but friendly waiters I can just sit comfortably at the bar by myself, eat my dinner, observe the kitchen and people around and feel good. cons: parma ham should be served ONLY as a cold cuts, it is so damn salty when grilled in pannini! Can we make it some sort of rule in every cooking book? Thanx!"
3,"Okay. I have an unnaturally positive opinion of Kumpir. They make potatoes with different toppings. This isn't rocket science. It is akin to Subway for potatoes.That being said, I love it. I love that it is open late, it is just out of the U/S-bahn station, and it is cheap. Did I mention that it is also tasty and the staff is always friendly? Let me say it now.I have run through most of the menu and it is pretty tasty. It seems like the people working there are generally happy to be alive, which I appreciate.The one thing limiting my review is the quality of some of the ingredients.  I could see an upgrade in quality bringing this to the next level, and a 5 star rating, as long as the price doesn't take an exponential hike.An extra euro here or there would be fine with better quality, but I will keep coming back anyway:)"
4,"This place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Probably the best tourist attraction i have seen so far! I was really surprised at how much i enjoyed my time here. I went in thinking I would spend one hour at most in this place and three hours later i could not get enough of this miniature wonderland. They have really thought of everything when creating the little moniture wonderland. The amount of detail that was put into this world is absolutely astounashing! As soon as you walk in they have the exhibit of a town in germany and they take you through the history of the town through various years. As you walk through they have a display of Switzerland, Hamburg, The airport, USA, Scandanvia and Bavaria (there might be one or two that i am missing maybe?) Italy was under construction. My absolute favorite was Switzerland, it was huge and it extended a bit on the third floor. Make sure you spend enough time in each country for the day-night transition because that blew my mind. The way the lights flickered and the train lights came one at a time was very life-like. They even had little miniature people inside the trains and cars as they went by. You will experience everything in this place, from a miniature concert experience to even little disasters (I don't want to spoil anything). This place is a must-see attraction. If you are in hamburg you have to go! Best 12euros I have ever spend!"
4,"We ordered Nouko Ramen, Gyoza, fried chicken, they all taste good, but I can't really tell whether it's because the food or because I'm too hungry, we waited 40min to get the table.Anyway, I will come again. Now, time for ice cream \o/"
1,Service is good after a little waiting time you get seated! Burgers don't take long. Ordered a rare farmers burger but got a burger grilled well done. After asking if that's the rare burger they just said sorry this happens when it's busy. That's it...Beer is alright. Sides are good.
3,"Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot.Whenever we meet you're usually grumpy. People say you're lovely but to me, you're just grumpy.This crisp Winter morning though you smile. You manage to brighten up my day. And for the first time I can see why people speak so fondly of you.A narrow city beach. Blue skies. Large container ships passing by and merging with the dockyards' silhouettes for a moment. A beach bar, a hot drink. People chilling, sunbathing, walking their dogs. Or kids.Hamburg, you showed me your pretty side. I can stay here for a while."
4,"Super friendly staff that made you feel like you were in Italy until you stepped back out in the Hamburg rain. The pizza was amazing and I managed to finish one on my own, which is rare, but it was so good I simply couldn't stop."
1,"As I am just a Polish turist, my opinion on those wurst is... not so amazing.If you wish to eat one hot sausage without any fork or knife, this is a place for you. Just an usual sausage in the middle of city centre. There are some tables available in nearby, but it is still in a middle of a busy pavement. I wasn't amazed, still what can you expect from such a dish for 3 EURO."
4,"Germans are known around the world for their excellence in engineering and attention to detail, and nowhere is that more effectively on display than Miniature Wunderland. Every last bit of the models is breathtakingly designed, and each section is filled with hidden details and Easter eggs. Some highlights include:* The entire place has a day/night cycle, complete with sunsets, colored lights, and every last car, building, and street lamp lighting up in sync with the cycle.* There's a river in one of the areas that has a remote-controlled boat in it, complete with tides achieved by pumping water in and out of the river in sync with the day/night cycle.* The Hamburg airport has a perfect replica, complete with takeoffs, taxiing, landings, and a working departure/arrival board.* Each display is filled with buttons that cause rocket launches, open buildings, prompt volcanic eruptions, and more!* The roads are full of cars and trucks that actually move and obey traffic lights.You can easily spend hours here ogling over every detail. I lost count of the number of times I said ""wow"" out loud. If you're touring Hamburg, just go. You won't regret it, not even a little."
2,"I don't know too many vegan places and being vegetarian, I simply enjoyed having the full choice of the menu :-) The dishes are Asian and I was very satisfied with my veggies and cashews in a slightly coconutty sauce. Service is friendly too and even though we had booked for 8, our nine-plus-dog group was accommodated without problems. There is no alcohol but a number of juice and tea options instead. You can even get vegan cakes and icecream. The only drawback - the place could really have been cleaner with some stains on the tablecloth covered by the place mats. Otherwise it's a lovely place, brightly lit and with some quirky decorations making it very cheerful."
4,"Amazing Breton style buckwheat crepes. I had the Nordique, which comes with smoked salmon and sour cream. The atmosphere was pleasant and nautical and my table shared a bottle of the house white wine which went perfectly with the meal. Ask for an English menu, there is one available."
3,"I wasn't expecting to eat Portuguese in Germany, but when in Hamburg... Delicious Aioli. Chorizo had a wonderful smoked paprika bent to it. The gambas in garlic and olive oil was exactly how it sounds with the garlic having nice roasted notes. The good news is that it all goes down well with a local draft, or a glass of red. The atmosphere was charming and felt like a hectic, but warm family restaurant."
3,"Came for a late Sunday afternoon lunch after walking around the area. I had no prior knowledge of Tiefenthal and therefore no expectations as my husband picked the spot. They serve breakfast until 4pm on Sunday so I was excited that we arrived at 3:30. I ordered the Eimsbütteler breakfast with the extra 3 scrambled eggs. It's quite a bit of food: 3 eggs, toast, salami, ham, 2 kinds of cheese, 2 rolls, croissant, butter & jam. The food was good - eggs a little dry and croissant was nothing to write home about but I think it all cost 12 euros. We were recently in Paris for a weekend and this kind of breakfast would easily go for 30. The salami and ham were quite good. Service was excellent, space was clean and quiet. My husband and his mom both had the Wienerschnitzel and we all agreed it was pretty good, until we realized they cost 20 euros each! Holy overpriced! We also tried the cheesecake and apricot cake. Neither were very good - not a lot of flavor and dry. I would 100% return for weekend breakfast if I'm in the area."
3,"Met an english group here a few times, solid service considering there were so many of us, close to a station as well."
4,"Since my visit in 2013, I've been telling everyone I know to go here who will be in Hamburg. (I'm a little surprised/ashamed I didn't write a review yet...)This place is incredible. It's several stories of a warehouse that's been converted into an aptly-named miniature wonderland. The attention to detail into every aspect of this space is simply astounding. It perfectly encapsulates what happens when smart, whimsical people set their minds to building amazing, tiny things :)Kids probably love it, too, but knowing my nephew we would probably never make it past the first floor-- it's that big and engrossing. I found the control center the most fascinating part, but others in my group liked the airport-- planes ""took off"", ""landed"", taxied and did it all over again on a schedule that was tracked in real time on a screen. Several places seem pretty darned accurately modeled in terms of what a place actually looks like; others have taken a wee bit of poetic license to make it fit within the warehouse (for example, the USA section represents Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and several other places that look as if they're right next to each other, when that is not exactly how it goes in the US). There's even a model of Hamburg. I won't spoil the wonder of visiting for yourself with any more details about what you'll see-- just plan to spend at least a few hours here to fully appreciate the splendor."
4,"The food is authentic and high quality. The restaurant is very well decorated and the staff are friendly. Best of all, they serve food that would be served in Vietnam. Very authentic! I highly recommend this restaurant!"
4,Hamburg is the SF of Europe. The harbor vibes with them dope coffee shops mang!!! Nord coast is one of the more classy joints with food on their menu. It overlooks the water and has a good amount of seating. Their lattes and espressos are on point. The cost wasn't overwhelming and their staff is very friendly. A great place to meet up with people.
3,"Really unique, genuine and nicetasting kebab! Tried the durumone which wasnt that big which accounts for 4 instead of 5 stars. Very affordable though so what can you expect."
3,Good food and good shots. Be prepared because you can end up drunk just before starting with the free shots the friendly waiters pour for you!
2,"YES VAPIANO IS POPULARYES VAPIANO IS FRESHBut it's overrated. I wouldn't consider this as a restaurant. It's a upscale fastfood chain since you get a card at the entrance to pay your ordered food with. It's a marketing strategy since you pay with a plastic card and not with real money, you lose the awareness of the value.And at the canteen you'll take a tray and after 15 min of waiiting in line hopefully you got your meal.This is not bad at all. I like it crowdy and waiting for someone to free their table so we can sit. No seriously I think it's fun :DThe only thing why I gave it 3 stars is because I'm always still hungry when I leave Vapiano. The dish you order comes with a huge bowl or plate or whatever but the actual food covers only 1/3 of it. And I refuse to order another one.  THAT'S THE CATCH. People order more because one dish is too little.I REFUSE bitches!"
4,"My boyfriend and I are in Hamburg for just a day and we decided to stop here based on the excellent reviews(though only few). You must keep the restaurants appearances out of your impression because the food and the hospitality of the staff make this five star worthy! I had the Wiener schnitzel, which was very flavorful and a huge serving! My boyfriend ate the curry wurst which was also excellent. If we were staying in Hamburg longer we would definitely make another trip here!"
4,"Great asian food, and it's all vegan! Every lunch is only 6,90EUR and includes a soup or spring rolls as starter. (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  My vegetables with tofu and cashews were absolutely delicious! (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  Great food and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."
3,A very interesting mock up of different location. we went there my friends kids 6-8 and they had a blast.
4,"Found my coffee joint in Hamburg!! Tons of space. Great light hip vibes. Amazing coffee at amazing prices. Whether it's to meditate on your beans, get work done, or meet up for a chat, this is the joint. They source from Five Elephant and some other roasters! This place is the real deal! Hit this place up. Foreigners are welcome hahahaha.. I think? Friendly staff and people."
4,"Best burgers in Hamburg!! Cheesecake is also amazing. Huge portions if you order burgers with fries (I never finish it all, but you can order without fries) and a nice selection of drinks. Burgers have english muffin buns...otherwise authentic toppings (also made to suit your taste) and ""eat with your hands"" instructions on the menus :) Reserve seats for a weekend meal. Friendly atmosphere."
3,Enough has been written about this place. The food is great. I like the room because of the minimal styling. You can't beat the sushi in Hamburg. The location is easy to reach and parking is not a problem. My one major gripe about this place is the service. These are the most arrogant waiters and waitresses I've run acorss in Hamburg. They start to annoy you when you are making a reservation and they annoy through to the end until you leave. This really diappoints considering how good the rest is.
4,"Cracking little Mexican cafe/bar serving real mexican food, the likes of which, I had never tasted! It's a lot like mud, basically, but made from chocolate, and call Mole. Maybe it's made from moles? Of course, the real attraction here is the extensive range of tequila, some of which didn't even make us projectile vomit across the table! Actually I suspect there may have been a little chundering but hell, it's all good."
4,"Fantastic venue for beach-related sport in Hamburg, including football, volleyball and swimming. There are around 4 pitches, several bars, BBQs, with great music and DJs. We were there to compete in the annual Hamburg netsoccer clash, where Qype came out on top!"
2,"I know we have the French Laundry in California and are terribly spoiled, but the food at this restaurant was a 4.  The service started out great and deteriorated to unacceptable over the evening, so I would put that at a 3.  When they served one of our party the wrong dessert, instead of apologizing and offering to serve the correct dessert, she said ""the other dessert is basically the same, just black currant vs strawberry.""  what the heck?!  we said, that was fine, that they could make up the mistake on our petit fors that we were getting to go (because we were too full).  They gave us the petit fors to go, but did not include anything extra.  We paid for accompany wine and no dessert wine was served.  They did not offer coffee or any other options at the end of the meal.  We have received expected service at other restaurants in Germany, so I don't understand.  $511 euros for a dinner should get exceptional service.  Boo to the Haerlin!"
3,"In one phrase: very authentic Bavarian place. Icecold genuine Bavarian beer served in huge Steins, typical Bavarian food, waiters in Bavarian clothes (dresses/Lederhosn), and, ehm, ""nice"" Bavarian music. You really would not realize you are in the north of Germany if it did not read ""Hamburg"" on the Menu...If you like Bavarian culture, you definitely will like this venue!"
2,"Wildfleisch burgers! Too bad I did not know what wildfleisch was until I got home from my dinner at Edelsatt and decided to look it up. I definitely like the all around organic offerings at Edelsatt as well as the idea of a venison burger patty. I ordered the Edelsatt burger. This was a hamburger that called for the use of forks and knives. Not knowing it was venison, the patty did strike me as odd. It appeared to me that the venison meat was not grounded well enough, and then was smashed together into a burger patty; it was kind of like a piece of steak that fell apart to easily when you bit into it. It's hard to describe. There wasn't enough salt on the patty either for my taste. The bio bread was difficult to cut or even bite into. My burger devolved into a messy heap. I did like the mayo and the grilled onions. Others have complained about the fries, but I rather liked them a tad soft. I washed it all down with a rhubarb fritz cola. It was 9€ for the burger plus 3.50€ for the added fries and drink. The restaurant itself is a cool spot. I dig the decor. The food came out fast and the staff was very friendly. The hubby and I decided, possibly in unison, that we would likely not order the burgers again. That is, unless they make it feel more like an actual burger patty. I would like to try the currywurst, so I'll be coming back at least for that."
3,Great place for a Sunday beer. In the summer at least!
3,"Fine cup of coffee - and such friendly service. Its a bit scruffy, but in a nice way. My son had a truly fresh mint tea = hot water + mintstick with leaves. Thats the best way to make a mint tea - love it. They also serve a fresh ginger tea. I would do that if I happened to come by again."
2,"Definitely not my cup of tea. Thankfully I've only been once. It's actually a couple years back and it ended up being the most expensive meal I've ever paid for (seriously!) I had invited an ex and her folks out to dinner. They had taken us out many times hence it was payback time. Unfortunately they were big eater and drinkers. A multi-course meal and many bottles (expensive as all hell) later we left this place, my wallet empty. Thankfully the food is ok and definitely of higher quality. The wine selection was also good. Yet, would I go back? No! I particularly dislike the decor and places like this in general. The majority of people eating here are not my crowd. It's fineplaces like this are made for those people. And one star is added to this review for providing such a place for them. That keeps 'em away from my favorite places. If you like typical Hamburg flair, with a real feeling of lots of Hanseatic upper class around you, this is your mecca. You can't go wrong with the food as it is a well run establishment. You probably won't be going here if you can't afford it so prices won't discourage you. The location is also quite nice I have to admit. I nice old house.perfect if you live nearby on the Elbchaussee and there's parking in the back..bring your Bentley's if you got 'em! If you're young, modern, cosmopolitan or anything but Hanseatic blue-blood, you'll feel better elsewhere."
4,"One of the coolest bars i have ever been to in my life. 3 room flat, is a 1970's house party. Well, on the surface. beneth lies a secret german fight club, i mean table football club...its kind of sureal. the beer is cheap, and the selection is plentiful. the sofas are comfy, and the people are nice. But piece of advice, the toliets are alittle unclear as to which is guys and girls...not that anyone minded...germany is a very liberal place"
2,"(my visit was in October 2015)I found Schmilinsky Weinbistro on Yelp. It's a small restaurant tucked into the basement of a hotel.The service is nice. There's one server to cover all of the tables, but with a limited number of tables, the workload is manageable. My server was really nice and helped translate the menu to English for me.After placing my order, I waited a painfully long time for my food. From the time I sat down to the time my food came, 60 minutes had elapsed. Painful!The food was good, though I found some bones in my fish. The person who prepped the fish should be more careful. But yum, that crispy skin was good.Lentils under the fish were a little salty (like a lot of food in Germany), but good. The mashed potatoes were good, but some chunks were too big.I had a glass of house wine that was also good, but I admit that I'm no connoisseur.I liked the feel, the food was good, and I want to support small businesses, but they have to fix the wait time issue."
4,"This was such a highlight of our trip to Hamburg. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the ordering concept is cool and easy, and the food is fantastic. The burgers, which they specialize in, are very tasty. I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. Unlike other reviewers I found the cheese to be perfectly melted. Also I ordered my burger medium-well and and it was perfectly cooked. The real winner at Burgerlich, however, is the pulled pork sandwich. My husband had it and i had such food envy. It is by far the best pulled pork sandwich I've tried anywhere in Germany and I would highly recommend it. The burgers are great, but the pulled pork sandwich is even better! The fries are really well done, crispy and perfectly seasoned. As the portions are pretty big it's possible to share fries between a couple. They have other sides like chips and salads as well. The prices are reasonable, especially for the food. Drink costs are a bit steep, but this is typical of most restaurants. The overall atmosphere is more on the hip and cool side. There was a dj playing pop music, which could be loud for some people, but we really enjoyed it. Overall I would highly recommend this place."
3,"I have walked by this place many times, an I guess I was too busy window shopping to notice this restaurant! Breakfast all day?! And I didn't know about it!? That is a crime. I ordered the French Breakfast at 15:00. It came with two buttery croissants, jam, nutella and honey. I had a sweet tooth, and this ""breakfast"" definitely cured it.  The juice was fabulous. Maracuja (passion fruit), orange and strawberry. Unfortunately the little fruit flies also know that they use fresh fruit in their juices, and they enjoy hanging around for a taste.  Will be back, especially to try other juices."
3,"On a spur, we checked out this restaurant near the Altona Sbahn. I'm a vegetarian and was super pleased with the options. The food was quite tasty and the service was good too. I enjoyed it!"
3,"Authentic, yummy Vietnamese cuisine, good quality meat, no use of glutamate. Ambiance could be a little cozier though and it was a little chilly inside."
3,"Cozy coffeehouse near points of interest in Hamburg! The atmosphere was warm and bright, and the caramel macchiato was well worth the long wait.That was our only complaint; the shortage of servers made our wait very long, first to put in our order, and then even longer to get our drinks. At least it was a respite from the gray, rainy Saturday outside, and I would get another large caramel macchiato from them anytime! (Well, anytime that I have plenty of time to wait;).)"
1,"We went here to get a nice lunch and it was quite of a disappointment.The pizza crust was definitely made from factory and the topping didn't taste fresh. We also got a oven baked potato with sallad and chicken and it was barely warm. I bet this is a great place to get drinks, based on other reviews, but DO NOT com here for the food - you'll regret it!"
4,"Everytime i walk through the weidenallee i see L'incontro and say to myself, i should try that place out.and i finally have!when i got there around 7 pm, the place was already full, and we got one of the last 2 available tables. the place was full all through out the evening, with more than half of the tables 'reserved'. the food is really good.I highly advise you to try the gnocchi with 'maronen' ... its a delight. L'incontro is a cute little italian restaurant, its cozy, could be romantic if you are in the mood.I think reservation would be preferable although not required. All in all, the weidenallee is a nice change from schanze (and not too far away), if you are looking for something for the older crowd"
3,"Take the general cool chic of the Schanze, pick a great location in one of the old slaughterhouses and then add in a TV chef and a minimalist menu. That's Bullerei. The prices are surprisingly cheap - about EUR8 for a meal + Astra beer. The food isn't particularly amazing though. It seems to be basic stuff, done better than average. I had chicken drumsticks with a pasta salad and Astra for EUR7.50. It was decent without being great. It's generally really busy, so although they have huge tables that would be great for groups, you might find it hard to get seating for more than 2-4 people. I'll probably try it again sometime.."
3,"Excellent paella! The staff speaks Spanish, Portuguese, and German. It is reasonably priced, we were a party of three and ordered more food than we could possibly eat and only spent 60 euros including drinks."
3,"I had the Labskaus, I think a Hamburg dish that looks like boiled beef and has the consistency of mashed potatoes. The restaurant and food are fine, but more notable is the street where it's located. My coworker tells me Deichstraße is one of the oldest streets in Hamburg, and the origin of the big fire of 1842 that burned down half the city. You can sit out front if the weather's nice, or take one of the alleyways around back for a great view of the canal and surrounding architecture after dinner."
2,Despite its location it is actually a decent bar with pretty good food and cocktails. Opens 24 hours at weekends during summer.
3,"Just around the corner from my flat in Hamburg, this place is brilliant with a group or just on your own. I have eaten here a few times and its my favourite local. It does great Roast Potatoes and lovely Weissbier!"
2,"Schöne Location und auch nette Mitarbeiter. Die Preise allerdings sind frech - viel zu teuer, für das, was man bekommt, gerade im Bereich der Kuchen und Torten."
4,Incredible restaurant! We had our wedding party here and the employees went above and beyond to help us make it special. Not to mention the food was incredibly delicious! I had the salted sea bass. Yum!!!!!! We will definitely return for more excellent food soon again.
4,"I used to go to this place very often when I lived in St. Georg. A little hidden in a sidestreet next to the famous ""Lange Reihe"", this is the coffee shop to go on your walk around the district. It is small, intimate,  friendly and very cozy. The prices are okay. Not very cheap of course, but affordable compared to shops like Starbucks or Balzac (the latter is around the corner and by far the wrong choice). They offer a nice choice of small snacks, candy, soda, pastries and ... of course... coffee which comes in two sizes. Ever since I left Hamburg, I returned every once in a while only to find out that nothing has changed in Peaberries which definately is a good thing here.They have rather restrictive opening hours and only very little place for seating. I suppose it is more of a ""coffee to go"" shop. Many people chose to sit on the benches outside by the Gurlittstr. which happens to be quite a nice promenade near the Alster."
4,Best museum I have been to! Super cool and such an accurate architectural design. I loved the airport and runway design as I just love flights! Everyone will definitely love this. Worth every penny
4,Even if you are not a big fan of Absinth (my case) I still recommend you visiting this place. The owner will find something (out of a 200+ different sorts) that suites you. This is a great place to go and relax after a hard day at work or maybe just talk to your friends. If you are not aniseed fan then try King of Spirits.
0,"Not a really good soup place --- for typical Phó. Small portion, and full of artificial taste. ---- definitely not recommend for Asians.Very noisy environment and unfriendly  service."
3,"What a strange experience this place was. It's a bar trying to be a dive in one of the richest parts of Hamburg. Weird mix of people: on one hand, the grungy rocker types and at the same time, young yuppies, wearing the standing collars and Burberry scarves. Really odd but at the same time amusing. The staff think they are tougher than they are working in a place like this but it fits the goal of the bar. Really tight quarters when it fills up but the vibe is good. If in the area though, a good place to grab a drink and have a couple laughs. You'll definitely not regret it even if this isn't your thing."
3,It was good. Price was good. Service very friendly.  Location is convenient right by the train station.
3,"Great panino and pasta, friendly staff, coffee not the best"
0,"Came by yesterday around 7pm, really hungry and thirsty, liked the location by the water so we sat on a table outside. One waitress saw us, smiled and went away. We sat for 10 more minutes. Another waitress came and brought the menu. We decided on soup, steak, salad and beer. We waited. After 10 Minutes we had the impudence to wave a waitress who was cleaning the table next to ours, she said ""Kollegin kommt gleich."" Maybe half the tables outside were empty and we saw at least 3 waitresses acting very busy. We waited another 15 minutes, then we left, really hungry and thirsty, to enjoy the ""Beautiful Life"" elsewhere."
1,I went into the meatery last night after have a few cocktails on the roof top of the hotel. I didn't feel like having steak so I opted for a burger. I got the classic burger which was a disappointment.  The burger was cold and not cooked to my liking. I got the brioche bun which was flat and not what I am used to a brioche bun being like.  The fries were good and piping hot . Overall I was disappointed I would never order there burger again.
2,"The beer is the star here. To my palate, it's distinctive across the three brews offered, each having a very aromatic, herbal quality. The food is solid German brew house fare with a twist. There's a curry-laden Thai soup that's delicious and a German ""tapas"" plate featuring mini-schnitzels, rõsti and wurst. The canal-side setting is quite nice."
2,"De vraies crepes, incroyable!++* Food: the only reason you want to go there is to eat those dark buckwheat flour 'galettes', which are much healthier and filling than than their crepes counterparts (served for dessert). The latter can be found in any street corner/mall, etc...The chocolate flambee one is a show by itself!* Atmosphere: you want to go there with a bunch of friends to enjoy a bottle of cider. Decoration is refreshing ! The ""Bretagne"" feeling is definitely there. Waiters wear those marine stripped shirts, Jean Paul Gaultier? I don't think so, they have a connected shop within the restaurant where you can buy those shirts. Sweet anyway...* Location: Deichstrasse is one of the few streets Hamburg which doesn't make my eyes bleed. There are other restaurants I'll visit soon or later.Staff: quite friendly & many French, good signs? Locals tend to think so ;)--The place probably lives on its glory time, now that it is quite famous in town it can afford to be less flexible. Case in point: I had an egg galette which came literally with 1 egg on top (really people !?) but then it ""only"" costs 4,1eur. The chicken one is prepared in mustard instead of having the chicken prepared and get the mustard extra/aside... I only see a trick here to keep unsold meat for an extra day in the fridge ( pretty wrong in my opinion)The only place in town for a true galette so go for the refreshing experience!However when everything comes in sugar, cheese or covered in questionable dressing and there is almost no room to adjust the toppings, I doubt that I'll be a regularThey need a serious competitor to wake them up, anyone ?"
4,I can't be better :) I love it. I had lived Sheldon cooper's dream for few hours :)
4,"Wow, tolles Essen! Sehr interessante Einrichtung. Nette Bedienung. Wir sind rundum glücklich :) Mittagstisch um die 10EUR und wahnsinns gute Qualität!"
4,"I like this place! Friendly people, associates and their coffee is great, salads tasteful and their bagels are 100% OK. Worth a visit and enjoy it!"
4,"Hallo an alle dort in Zwick, insbesondere Jaqualin lol! Sie wahrscheinlich nicht an mich erinnern, ich bin Kevin verwendet, um mit Ihnen in Cafe Wintergarten Arbeit an der Rothenbaumchaussee, war ich mit Ihnen zu arbeiten als Barkeeper lol!, ich kam gerade über Zwick und Ihr Foto online, nur eine kurze Anmerkung zu sagen Hallo und Sie immer noch aussehen wie Ihr Spaß haben:) Es war schon immer ein Ort zum Feiern: ') Kevin in Liverpool"
3,"Vegetarian, but surprisingly not bad! The Eggs Benedict was great with potatoes and fruit cup. The entire staff was all female which was really cool. They were working very, very hard. Service was kind of slow, but that may be a German thing. Not much seating. I had ice water, which they didn't try to sell me a pricey bottle...nice. Freshly squeezed OJ and hand-spun shakes. This is a local favorite restaurant. The neighborhood is kind of suspect, but definitely OK during the day when w went. This was truly home cooking. I would go here again, bring a guest and recommend to a friend (but prepare them all with a description of the place)"
2,"The small Italian restaurant is located in the art nouveau neighborhood of Eppendorf, hidden at the corner of Isestrasse and Heilwigstraße.It comes with an outside patio and two small dining areas inside that are packed all week.Seating can be tight and it might happen that you are run over by other guests and the waiters if you are sitting next to the corridor. It's also very noisy, so don't come here if you are planning a romantic candle light dinner. This place is recommended for dinner with friends or families outings. The food is delicious and I highly recommend sticking with the daily instead of the regular menu. The pasta is awesome as are the meat and fish dishes. A popular appetizer is the calamari dish, which you shouldn't miss.Coming here you will see mainly locals. Be aware of their certain bourgeoisie attitude that might also be adapted by the staff. + cozy restaurant, +popular with locals- tight seating, - noisy, - guests and staff w attitudesAverage entrée: EUR 20."
1,"Dinner for two on Friday night! Showing up at 6 o'clock we were the only guests. The restaurant filled up quickly. The service was friendly and fast, implicating that the food was premade... We ordered humus as a starter. Unfortunately we returned most of it. The bread was stale. The main dish was nothing special. The rice was over cooked.Besides that the location and the service were good. Might return to grab a drink but no food!"
4,"If you are in Hamburg and do not go to Sagner's, you are making a mistake. We were surprised there was not a line around the block given the small restaurant size. We had two excellent apps in the beef carpaccio and the scallops and mushrooms. Make a reservation and go. It is an excellent small family restaurant."
4,"This place is well worth a visit if you are in Hamburg and fancy some nice beer, in a lovely setting along with really good food too.We visited in December and the decorations on the brewing kit (yes they brew their own beer here!) and the rest of the restaurant was lovely.Menus are also in English and the food is typical German fayre done very well. Definitely try this place out."
0,"Heard great things about this restaurant from a friend who travels to Hamburg frequently, and the fact that they closed at 11 was even better! The night before we had called to confirm what time their kitchen closed and we were told 10:30. However, when we arrived the next day at 9:10, we were told that they weren't seating + serving anymore and we were forced to find another dining option last min on our last night in Hamburg."
3,"On a business trip in town and saw this place.  Walked in on a Tuesday night and seated without a reservation.  We all ordered Ribeye Steaks.  All 3 were cooked to perfection.  One person had the Pepper Sauce and sad is was spicy (says scharf on the menu), and loved it.  Very clean restaurant, and service was great.  Steaks were excellent for the price.  Would definitley come back again."
2,"I even read the reviews ahead of time, but I wanted this place to be a good option in the neighborhood for an easy lunch or dinner. It just didn't impress me.We went early on a Saturday evening, and were seated promptly in a little booth towards the back (which was great). My daughter got some colored pencils and a coloring menu, so she was set. We ordered a round of burgers, including one off the kids' menu for my daughter.I had the bacon cheeseburger, which was a couple of very flat and overcooked patties smothered in toppings (to be eaten with a fork, in the local style). Passable, but not fantastic. My wife's ""veggie burger"" turned out to simply be a large piece of fried/melted mozzarella with some peppers integrated somehow, then topped with arugula and stuck in a bun. It was a little comical; we should have read the menu more closely, but we didn't.The service was fine (in fact the waitress was fairly attentive), but it just wasn't a great experience. Too bad."
3,"In the summer this place seems to be coming into its own. Sitting outside in the square with a huge and excellently made goats cheese salad was extremely enjoyable. It may not be as cool as sitting inside with the trendy design and the big picture windows, but when the sun is out you need to grab it while you can. As well as the excellent salad there seems to be good choice of pasta. I am told the coffee is good as well, but haven't tried it - yet! Highly recommended as a enjoyable but fast lunch spot."
2,I found the atmosphere to be very cool. The place was full. A friend and I from Canada have been on a mission to find awesome Asian street food. This place unfortunately did not deliver. We ordered the spring rolls to start. The filling was good but the spring was burnt. For our mains I ordered the chicken pho and I asked for extra veggies like in the veggie pho. The broth was ok. The noddles and  veggies were also over cooked. My friend ordered the crispy noodles with beef and veggies. She liked her dish  but didn't love it. I don't know if I would go back. My go to Asian street food is still Quan Do in the city! It's amazing !
3,"Really nice bar in the heart of St.pauli, good vibes and great music all around.It was crowded from the moment we went in until we left  at around 4am, as I'm going out but never until such hour I was rather surprised.We wet there on a Friday, so the party went on and on- from German pop hits to Hip Hop, 80's and Soul- almost every song was right on. People kept dancing, drinking and smiling despite the density.I was barely sitting down, just when I was really tired, so thumbs up for the DJ.Drinks are fairly priced.However, one thing that bothered me was the cigarette smell- for such a crowded and small place, it's better if people would smoke outside, because it seems like there's no ventilation system, couldn't breathe at some point.Places like this make me value fresh air- and hate how I smell later."
3,"My usual usage of Irish pubs is based on large TV screens and football - with little else of merit, so I approached the Irish Rover with trepidation. But this is an Irish pub as it should be: Dark, cosy, welcoming, friendly, Kilkenny and Guinness on tap and good solid food! In particular the Guinness was as good as it gets outside Dublin and the fish and chips comes with real chips (not frites, not french fries, CHIPS!!). The clientele was a mix of ex pat Brits and Irish and young Germans. Always a good sign. You would take a place like this for granted in Dublin or London. But for this frequently travelling Brit finding a good traditional pub in Hamburg whose attraction is based on good beer, food and company, was a real joy."
2,"First of all, be careful when telling friends ""Let's meet at Bok,"" in ""Schanzenviertel,"" because for one, there are several chains in Hamburg and next, there are I believe three already in the Schanze area.   I first ate at the Bok on Susannenstrasse with friends from University when I moved to Hamburg, which we found was a nice meal, comparably to the Mensa (cafeteria) food that we more or less often ate on a regular basis.  This sushi bar is really great for students because it is casual, yet feels a bit upscale, but  affordable.  It is levels above Sushi Circle which I personally think people eat there simply for the entertaining factor of prepared sushi on a rotating belt.  Otherwise, instant sushi is never quite as delicious as freshly made to order. If I visit Bok, I like the location along Schulterblatt because during warm days and summer weather, they bring out long wooden benches to eat outdoors.  This street is great for dining outside with friends, people watching, and having some drinks well into the evening, then heading over to the several bars in the immediate area. I would go here if you prefer a variety of sushi choices, vegetarian options, like Japanese noodles, sitting outdoors in the warmer months to come and want to be in the midst of the buzzing Schanzenviertel neighborhood vibe, off the main street, at an affordable price."
4,"Great coffee, great price! The place is cozy and it knows what it's doing. Nothing more to say. Would definitely recommend to drop by!"
4,Came in here not particularly hungry but after seeing the size of the portions ended up eating quite a bit! Meat was so tender and tasty and I especially liked the freshness of the salad and the bread was just lovely.
4,"A range of great burgers and beers, and the service is very good; you'll be served quickly and, in my experience, food doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to arrive. Plus, if there's a Bundesliga or 2.Bundesliga game, they'll have it on all of their three TVs. Really cool place."
3,"I like that cafe. They have good food, the service is nice, you can sit outside and the prices are decent. They also have a good breakfast with huge rolls. The last time we came here we had the panino turkey arugula and the chicken with mashed potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and loads of hollandaise sauce. So good!:) Both. Also the neighborhood is great, alternative, cool stores... Love the 'Schanze'."
4,Best Ethiopian restaurant in Hamburg hands down. I am Ethiopian and I haven't had quality Ethiopian food in Germany. My girlfriend also liked it. The place is small and intimate. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to have a good Ethiopian food in Hamburg. P.S. you'd need to get a reservation in advance.
3,"This restaurant is pretty good! I visited Ramen Bar Zipang on Saturday night at 6.30pm. There was already a queue but I was able to get a table within 20 minutes. I ordered a bowl of fried chicken and a chashu shoyu ramen. I enjoyed the fried chicken very much, however, although it was crispy and succulent, it was a tad too greasy for it be perfect. I also quite enjoyed the ramen. The ramen stock was thinner than what I was expecting but the portion sizes were great and the ramen was still tasty.At the end of the meal, my ramen cravings were satisfied."
4,"Great Greek restaurant. We walked into the restaurant at midnight on a Saturday night. It was still opened until 2am. The waiter was not so nice but I can understand given the time. For only 12€50, I've got a big plate with pork Souflaki, tzatziki, gyros and fries. They even offered us a salad in entrance. The flavors reminded me when I was in Greece few years ago, so good job!"
3,"This is very personal restaurant with high ambitions and with good natural wines, which is a bit hard to find in Hamburg.Absolutely worth a visit!Great staff!"
3,"Great sushi with perfect size, awesome concept of IPad ordering and friendly staff! All you can eat for 25 Euros = 5 orders of your choice times*10= 50 orders over 150 minutes. The industrial feeling mixed with a Japanese touch goes well together. For the dessert I can recommend the green-tea ice-cream as a perfect end of a great dinner."
4,yes it really is the best bratwurst in hamburg. ask for an extra roll of bread as theyre very fresh there
3,"Very good food. Went late on a Saturday night and they served us until late. Great staff, very warm."
2,"We ordered 2 Pho, 1 with beef, 1 with chicken. It wasn't bad but there was no ingredients that we could put ourselves in the soup... Normally, you can put coriander, soja beans and squeeze lime yourself which is part of the fun.Their mango-coconut milkshake was delicious though!"
3,"I really should come here more often, considering that it's across the street from me. I like it here because it makes for both a great coffee shop during the day and a really nice (albeit a quite loud) bar during the evening. They serve soy-based drinks, which is a major plus, and coffee until late. Need to remember to come here on a wednesday for some live jazz!"
3,"Like usual, super Burger and tasty Cocktails.Insiders will always go the roof, great Lounge feelingand super View to the Elbe River.(Good Weather Only)Side Area of the Roof is Rain- and Wind protected.Don't miss it for a Tour through Hamburg."
4,Great place to enjoy a hearty breakfast and a nice cappuccino. The place looks nice and the staff is friendly.
4,"Some of the best, nicest barkeepers I've ever seen.Great selection of American whiskeys, will convert the most ardent scotch lover."
3,having a cup of really good espresso at marsbar also includes usage of their free wifi (wlan). sometimes you meet some b-celebrities like sylvie van der vart or her husband there. maybe because marsbar is close to RTL nord.its nicer in summer because you can sit outside and smoke.
3,"The Block House in the Gänsemarkt isn't much to look at, especially from the outside, but the steaks are first class. A 250g rump or rib-eye will set you back around EUR17-EUR25, but that comes with a good-sized starter salad and a choice of chips (fries) or baked potato. One point to note is that a medium-rare is actually quite rare.. So, my friends had the steak, which apparently was wonderful, but I had the cheeseburger. EUR8.50 for a 200g burger with fries and coleslaw. The only complaint I have about the burger was that they didn't give me a choice of cheese, but otherwise it was great. Probably the best burger I've had outside the USA - however, it was my first burger in Germany.."
0,Worst service i have ever experienced ... 20 minutes wait just to order... 30 minute wait to get food... 20 minute wait to get another drink... 15 minutes still waiting for the guy to deign to bring us the check so we can ask for a to go box... Which will take another hour!! He passes us by to clean a table while were trying to ask for a check... He just walks away... The food is crap as well ... But this seems to be a theme in this city...
4,"If you are in Hamburg, and you don't eat lunch or dinner here, I'm gonna be mad at you.Totally perfect. Don't miss it. Great food, great English speaking staff! I had the Maultauchen app and it was awesome, a dumpling filled with meat and spinach. Outstanding flavor. I then moved on to the meatloaf and Spätzle, which was the best I've had in years. The sauce over it all was to die for! I might come back for dinner tonight!"
4,"I was here on Thursday night with my husband. We were blown away by our meal and immediately made a reservation to come back for Saturday night even though we only had three nights total in hamburg! The first night we had the protein salad and meze plate and the second we had spring lasagne, sweet potato peanut soup and a pumpkin curry dish. Every bite is amazing. This is an absolute must experience restaurant. Some of the best food we have ever had.  As California foodies, that is saying a lot. And all organic and vegetarian! How is it possible? You have to see for yourself. The hosts are warm, welcoming and personal. Don't miss this special special restaurant. We will think of it for many years to come and will make sure to return."
3,"I came here with some friends over the weekend and had some pretty awesome food. I ordered the Big Caesar which is a large caesar salad with a side of rib eye steak. My steak was grilled to medium rare perfection and perfectly salted. I was really impressed with it. I paid 15 euros for it which is reasonable. Although I did not order a hamburger, I can attest to their mammoth sizes. They also came with twice fried fries which I happily ate off my buddies plates. It's definitely a place you want to make a reservation for as it got pretty crowded on a Saturday night. The only downside was that our food took a long time to come. Other than that, I'll most likely try out the steaks next time."
4,"This place feels so comfortable, it might as well be your besties apartment! very cool set up, easy access to the bar, even on weekend. Its very refreshingly cozy and the crowd is more laid back and not slamming drinks left and right. good place to sit and chat with friends, or play some foosball."
4,This is THE place to go get a burger! I have to say that although I mostly prefer white meat and many times vegan meals - I love to go get myself a juicy one there! Its that amazing! The meat is good quality steak meat and the buns are from this great bread made with egg Apart from all.. There are real potato fresh made fries that I usually just get to taste after im super full with the burger. Loving them though my fav is Da Birdhouse with double patties. Thats one cheerful place besides the great food!
1,"Fast in, fast out: this place will quell all your primary late-night urges after all those beers:* fat* carbs* saltIt will indeed do this as competently as any cheap hot-dog place in Denmark .... and that's about it.Taste-wise, nothing to write home about, particularly the flavorless mayonnaise was a turn-off for me."
2,"Traditional swabian comfort food. Not a lot of options in menu.We took lentils and Spätzle. The lentils mash had nice flavor to it, but the Spätzle just felt like raw pasta which wasnt that interesting. We also took German dumplings (Maultaschen). I was not a fan though my friend was. The soup was good though.The desert (some apple pancake with vanilla ice cream, forgot the name) was surprisingly very good. All ingredient completed each other.Also keep in mind the place is very small with only a few tables."
2,"Have to agree with previous review, trendy enough but I was irritated by the micro-portions. A few grams of food are not going to be enough to fill you. In fairness, what food there was did taste good."
4,"One of the best tourist destinations in Hamburg.  Having visited before it was the reason we chose to come back to Hamburg again.  No two visits are the same.Make sure to reserve your entry time online to avoid long delays at your arrival.Take your time at each display to look for hidden surprises.  Look for videos on YouTube to get your plan laid out for the day, and plan to spend the day here.  The airport alone is worth several hours."
3,"Super location across from Abaton Kino in the University quarter of Hamburg, this Turkish restaurant is a favorite of students and movie enthusiasts. I have enjoyed lunches and dinners here for close to ten years and throughout that time quality and service have varied but during the FilmFest Hamburg, both were exceptional. A big bonus is the non-smoking section in the front of the restaurant, actually away from all the smokers. My spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo dough served with a green salad was hot, fresh and mouthwateringly delicious. Not only that, but when I flashed my press pass and said I was in a hurry, I had the best fast food ever. Many appetizers are enough for a good value meal, but as with most places, prices have gone up so it is not the bargain it used to be, particularly when it comes to drinks. The atmosphere depends on the customers as the place itself is unremarkable and at garden level (meaning limited daylight) but outside tables on a sunny day can be quite the treat. Open seven days a week from 9:00am until 3:00am with breakfast and special lunch menu."
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90.Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel.Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
3,"Good food, and the wines were priced  faily compared to retail prices (the bottles we bough at, €49 and €99, were about 2xstore prices).The young waiter from Sardinia was very attentive and coped completely with strange Danish humor;)"
3,Very satisfying pizza. Crunchy thin crust. Many toppings to choose from including pineapple and tofu. Vegan friendly options. Nice seating at wood tables. Menu available in German and English language.
2,"I wasn't impressed by this place at all outside of the fact that it's a pretty cool location with trendy interior design. Was here for lunch and have avoided coming for dinner having been forewarned that service is horrible. At lunch they have basic fare. This is not gourmet food by far. Nevertheless I enjoyed my lunch but wasn't blown away by it at all. Service was OK but also not going out of their way to please. Prices were also quite fair considering that this is a restaurant owned and run by a TV chef. Still though, you have to provide better if you want to attract people with your popularity on TV. Getting people in the door and then just basically offering things that everyone nearby has isn't going to cut it. I wanted more in regards to food. They managed to get the decor right but it would of been easy to have really creative food and great service. This place would draw even larger crowds than it does now simply based on popularity of the owner. Maybe once it loses it's ""newness"" they may focus more on the food and employees yet until then I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."
3,"Got here about 30 minutes before they closed for the afternoon on a friday! The place was not packed at all and the wait staff were happy to sit us. There is a reasonable lunch special for about 5 euros which I recommend and which my friend and I ordered from. I did notice that they had a dim sum menu. I love dim sum so I will be back for sure to try that next time!For this lunch adventure though, we ordered from the lunch Specials menu. I ordered the curry fish and my friend ordered the si chuan eggplant. We started with hot and sour soup which is included in the lunch special. The soup was really good, I added a couple dashes of white pepper to enhance the flavors but it was still really good without it. Then the main dishes were presented to us in a sharing style. With both orders in the middle of the table and a side of rice for both of us to share. I really enjoyed both dishes! The fish curry is the normal yellow curry and had bits of carrots and onions in it. The fish was very tender and curry was very flavorful esp. over the rice. Yum! I tried some of the eggplant and it wasn't too spicy but it as also really flavorful. My friend and I happily cleaned our plates! Overall, its a solid choice for chinese food. The lunch special is reasonably priced. The portion size of the lunch specials are perfect for lunch as well, not too much but just enough to fill you up!I will definitely be back for dim sum :)"
4,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Hamburg. Excellent coffee, warm service and a tiny discount if you bring your own cup :))"
4,"My new favourite café and a highlight of my Hamburg visit.  Quaint and full of character,  good vibes and chill tunes - this café serves up some amazing homemade cheesecake (highly recommend!). The homemade ice-cream is also bomb! Staff are friendly and informative."
4,"Great food, fantastic service... Loved the ambience"
2,"I was hoping to see the (low) standard of service that we encountered in Bavaria get better as we dined in Hamburg but it was not so. Service here was definitely slow and not very attentive. Our waiter spoke fine English and that part of the meal went well, but engaging him to get our order placed was a bit challenging.Yes, they have a printed menu. It's in German. There's also a list of daily specials on the board, written in German that we could sort of read. Google Translate doesn't work well when you can't work out what the letters are. And then, there's another list of specials that the waiter has in his head, which is... interesting.I let him talk me into a mushroom salad starter which was unusual and quite delicious. A variety of grilled mushrooms, shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Enough for two to share.For main course, I chose the spaghetti vongole. Very good, a plate of pasta tossed in olive oil and garlic and then topped with cherry tomatoes, clams, shrimp and other seafood. Other than the pasta was perhaps a little underdone (or my taste for it is off?), it was delicious and I ate nearly the whole thing. Keto? Not today!My friend had the pappardelle with a beef and veal sauce. She said it was delicious but pointed out that there was no parmesan cheese to be had anywhere. And once she pointed that out, it was strange. Our waiter wasn't to be seen after the food was delivered so after waiting a bit, we decided to dig in. By the time we spotted him, there wasn't much point.So what could have been a five star meal dropped to just three because the pasta was underdone (in my opinion) and the lack of service which just left us underwhelmed.Note: There is Trattoria da Enzo and they have another Trattoria Due Da Enzo around the corner.[Review 12053 overall, 1836 of 2019.]"
2,"This tourist spot has its ""cool factor"" being one of the biggest miniature displays of its kind in the world, but the crowded Disneyland long lines of pushing and shoving while walking around inside of this destination, steals away from the magic of the Wonderland, because you wonder if you will ever get to see something up close, because there are so many cute kids running around pointing and cheering in awe.  You feel kinda like a jerk if you do not offer your spot to one of these sweet faced angels to get a closer peek before you.  If and when it is not overly crowded, which is hardly the case as this is a very popular tourist spot for not just kids but also adults, the displays are really fascinating. They have an airplane runway where you actually see model planes from most international carriers, I mean, I am Thai and I even saw a Thai Airways plane!  You get to watch them slowly pull out onto the runway like a real plane then take off into the sky complete with sounds of the engines!Most of the displays are European and being an American, it is cool to see, but hard to identify with the land markings as much as a European child or adult would recognize the details better.  They have the Alps, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavian countries, and even the USA, particularly the Vegas display interested me.  There is a mixture of switching from day to night scenes in the rooms, and also an entire water display  going into the Northern Scandinavian countries. My favorite miniature area was Hamburg, because I live here and it was cool to recognize the layout of the city, see the Hafencity, the churches, the super cool HSV football stadium complete with HSV fans in the seats,  etc..... Miniature displays are also more identifiable with people if they personally know the thing or place well that is being miniaturized because we all like to check for accuracy and are amazed at the details and intricate work that goes into these ornate displays.Tip: Try to either go really early in the day when it opens or really later in the day before it is about to close, otherwise, it is often too crowded to see anything and you feel rushed to look at move on so you are not blocking the way for others to see."
4,"Hands down the best price to food ratio in the city. All burgers are freshly made to order and they will make whatever crazy burger combinations you throw at them. It's possible to get a burger, fries, and a beer for under 10€. This is a great place to go if you looking to eat a good burger on a budget."
3,"A lovely place to spend a summer's day. Swim, sunbathe, take a boat trip, visit the planetarium or sit in Schumacher's beer garden. Also a concert venue. nice for outdoor concerts although they have to finish by 10pm."
3,"When in Hamburg, you eat a hamburger, right?We'd had a long and exciting morning, traveling from Lubeck all the way to the airport and back into town, and needed lunch as soon as we got into town.  We walked out of the metro station, saw this place, and agreed that it made sense.  The place was packed, even at 2pm on a Friday.  Our group of 3 sent 2 to get food while the third held space for us to sit when we got our food - yes, it was that busy. The menu was all in German but with pictures to make it easy to understand.  I got the burger with the extra tomato relish and arugula, along with fries.  Most meals come with the combo, and I chose the sparkling water.   You order at the counter and then wait for your food to come up.  They're cooking it fresh, so it did take a few minutes to get the food.  The burger was cooked well, but was still juicy.  The bun was a little weak, but since everyone in the room was eating with knife and fork, they didn't mind that it was falling apart.  I also liked the crisp fries, even without ketchup, which I didn't get since it cost extra.  Portion was large - good deal for a lunch in Europe."
3,"I like Thämers. It offers a friendly, beery old-style pub ambience without a hint of oompahpah or that sneaking suspicion that they're putting it on just for you. Much more personality than the other offerings at Großneumarkt. Food is hearty but good (mountains of bratkartoffeln with everything!) and I find myself coming back here often for dinner and to sit and read outside over a beer and enjoy the balmy summer evenings."
2,"Kleiner Coffee Shop nahe der UBahn Hallerstraße mit wenigen Sitzplätzen, aber süße Inneneinrichtung. Die Preise sind ok (z.B. Caffe Latte Medium 3,20€).  Die Bedienung war etwas wortkarg, aber alles in allem kann man auf einen Coffee-to-go vorbeischauen wenn man in der Gegend ist."
4,"Open till midnight, quick and cheap meal fix. Friendly store attendants and ample portions. I love how they smoosh and mix up your döner box before filling and layer the sauce every now and then, and not just plop things into a box that never mix."
3,OVerall a great place to have German dinner. The restaurant is very small and intimate and you must make a reservation. Everything we tried was great. Check it out!
3,"The place is quite small but beautifully situated and it is serving good fish dishes. The service is very helpful and nice. The owner is a nice and chatty guy. Unfortunately there's no toilet and one must use one in ice cream spot next to it, which is kinda awkward. One must also know that there are few places to sit. Nevertheless place worth visiting."
4,"This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel reception. We had the weinersnitchel (small portion is good), beef roulade, ham soup and labskaus.  It was all absolutely wonderful. The beer alsterwasser was a surprise because I usually hate beer but this one was great. Finally the hot chocolate is perhaps the best I've ever had."
3,"Great beer, and good selection of dishes to go with it. the staff is friendly and very polite."
1,Very expensive for average food. Feels a bit snobby. Waiters are busy but friendly. They politely resolved a mistake on our bill (5x Moscow Mules instead of 3x) without questions asked. However I'd rather spend that much money somewhere else.
3,"Yum! Quick, easy, and filling. I got the first lamb dish on the menu and it was great. They don't have enough seating for their demand, so people come and wait around looking for seats all the time. It's a little bit fast-food like, actually. But the food is simple and tasty. Comes with naan and rice and yogurt (+ salad and a soup kinda thing) for a great price."
2,"FYI: I only rate the food! :)We went there to have some proper Japanese ramen, this place was recommended by my sister who lived here (Hamburg) for around 3 years - according to her it is one of the few ramen shops.We were excited. We had fried chicken, 2 bowls of ramen (the 12/13€ ones, can't remember the names), and 1 dessert (mochi ice cream). The chicken was good, fresh, good coating, crispy and the chciken was really soft and juicy. It lacked some flavor in my opinion, but I was aware that Japanese tend to have quality food with less intense flavor, natural. There was a dipping sauce, was ok, but I wished there was some sea salt or other additional dipping. Would order it again!The ramen, the main attraction, was a little disappointing, I am afraid to say that. I was looking forward to the broth - it was indeed rich and thick - but it had really little flavor, personally I liked some ramen better back in Japan (like street food ramen for 5€). It lacked the soothing taste of rich porky flavor, Indon't know how to describe. The ingredients, noodles, pork meat were ok too. I wish I could have given a positive review for the ramen, but it was just ok.The mochi ice cream was good, nothing too exciting, but a refreshment after the rich and fatty food. SUMMING UP: I wish it was our favorite ramen shop nearby, but it is not. Whenever we feel like having soothing ramen (esp. on cold winter days), we wouldn't think of the ones here. Even though it is not bad, it wouldn't be satisfying either. The chicken was the best, followed by the dessert. While the ramen in total was almost good, the main criteria for me, the broth, didn't give me that sense of satisfaction I am looking in bowl of ramen.Maybe we will try it out again, in winter, but until then we will hunt for another ramen (if there is any).Not included in rating: The price for everything (fried chicken, 2x ramen, 1 dessert, 2 drinks) was 45€, not good value in my opinion, compared to the expectations I had. The service was nice and quick."
4,Tasty Food. Quick Service. Was Three dir Lunch. Menu was a bit hard to read from far away written on the board. But waiter helped us choose the right dish for us.
4,"This is actually the first place I've been in Hamburg when I first came here, so it's kind of special for me cause it brings up a lot of good memories, sensations and people. It's a great place to go if the weather is good and chill a bit drinking a beer or watching a football game, i.e. during the World Cup or the Europeans."
1,"This is a really great bar if you enjoy being deafened by an Elvis impersonator so much that you can't even order your beer because no one can hear you. Oh and you're blinded by strobe lights. And surrounded by a mix of drunk college kids and older people who are still college at heart. Otherwise, I think you'll find the ambiance stressful, the beer so so, and the time worth spending somewhere else."
3,"Feld's Salat makes a respectable lunch salad, and apparently everyone else thinks so, too (it's one of the few places in Hamburg where I've seen people queued up for lunch). I've been a handful of times now, and never really had a bad experience. I think my favorite salad might be the Ziegenkäse (goat cheese) salad, which is a pretty normal salad until they drop a huge hunk of broiled goat cheese on top. It's good. I've also had the caesar's salad, which comes with chicken, and is pretty tasty (but a little heavy; defeats the purpose of eating salad for lunch).The ladies behind the counter are surprisingly friendly for how relentless the line of customers is, and the seating is somewhat limited but turns over quickly. Definitely up there with Green Lovers as one of my favorite salad spots near work."
4,"I love going to Oma's Apotheke when I'm hungry - the menu selection is wide and the prices are affordable, I've never left Oma's Apotheke hungry and have always enjoyed everything they've put in front of me. Oma's Apotheke is on the corner of Schanzenstrasse, opposite the S-bahn station, which makes it very central and a great place to meet friends for a bite to eat. The large tables allow larger groups to sit together, when we're there we normally fill up a table or two (and all manage to find something on the menu, including the veggies!)."
3,"So much more than meets the eye when entering gute stube. Go for the garden in the back of the weather allows for it. You get a lot of food for your money, we had the chicken salad. All good ingredients, however the salad was lacking a rinse. The rest was great. Delicious homemade bread was served as a gesture, and we had a delicious home made lemonade with strawberries and mint. Definitely worth a visit, and great service all the way through."
4,"Headed to luigis after a long day after hearing some really great things about it and i was not disappointed! Me and my dad had a pizza and pasta to share and both were really great. Although there was a little queue to get a seat, it moved really quickly and the wait was definitely worth it. Very reasonably priced pizzas and pastas, and great drinks as well! Definitely will come back!!!"
3,"Nice selection of coffees, spacious interior and tons of good food options."
2,"Unique place. Almost without competition in the area.Cool industrial design.Coffee was excellent. It was my taste. Less acid. Cake was OK. We had ""Stachelbeerenkuchen"" and ""Damengedäck"". Very very sweet.Service was quick and friendly. However it took way to long to get our ordered stuff. Ok, it was Saturday afternoon. However a place like this should have a much shorter reaction time."
4,Exquisite service! Super interior. Love their salted popcorn as nice welcome. Had sushi at this place and loved it! Also tried their sweet potato fries with guac but the guac was a bit too watery for my taste. All in all a really nice place to stop by after shopping. Thumbs up for the great staff!
2,"Due to some stellar (German) Qype reviews I was eager to visit Speisekammer this saturday - and left somewhat disappointed. Food is decent, but priced a bit too ambitiously for what one gets. My Caesar Salad, for example, was perfectly edible, but yet another German variation of the theme instead of a ""proper"" Caesar. My friend's breakfasts weren't exactly spectacular, what with a rather bland assortment of cheeses and not very appetising food garnish. All this means Speisekammer doesn't exactly end up on my ""avoid"" list, but given disproportionality of prices and the quality of food on offer I feel no urge to go there again in the future."
2,"Came for a Sunday night dinner with a coworker. It's a nice, casual, pretty traditional German restaurant. I had the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and fries, which was pretty delicious. The kupfer (copper) beer was also delicious. Service was excellent, and all of the waiters spoke English, which is nice for a gringo like me. The main menu is in German and English; being downtown and in a business district, it seems like they get a lot of tourists/travelers. Entrees are in the 10-15 Euro range.I was bummed because I really wanted the Schweinehaxe (pork shank) with dumplings, but they were out. I ordered a different pork cutlet, but they were out of that, too. This was at 7 PM on a Sunday night, so not super-late, but I suspect they don't get deliveries over the weekend, so they were pretty much out."
4,"Superb! We easily spent the whole day there. And you need to! I took over 700 photos of different scenarios we found throughout the ""lands"". Absolutely brilliant. Something for everyone. The detail and thought that has gone into this is genius. The trains are so much fun to watch, the day/night cycle offers a different perspective, the airport is amazing (with takeoff timetable and self-parking planes!!), the mini Hamburg is fantastic as well. Plus all the little ""easter egg"" finds - so much fun. You guys have thought of everything. Quite literally kept us entertained for hours. There is a cafeteria as well, with food and drinks at a reasonable price. Great for recharging half way through and you sit in coach class booths. LOVED IT! Keep it up."
1,the lunch pasta here has large portion.
3,"Ate here when the vegan restaurant Froindlich was too full and they recommended Xich Lô. There were plenty of vegan options and I loved the red curry. Another table nearby ordered something interesting with dry ice coming from the meal-- looked amazing. -1 star because the still water was not my favorite. I think it has a lot of minerals so it might be healthier, but it just tasted really bad to me. Also the dessert portion was a bit small.  Overall a wonderful spot, fast service and would recommend for vegans."
2,"A pretty standard Indian place. It's nothing extraordinary but is part of the Schanze scene and like most places has seating outside on the sidewalk. I found service to be quite disinterested and not fast which started annoying us after a while. Food on the other hand was good and the two times I've eaten there, it was good. Unfortunately I find that the portions are quite small and they skimp on meat if you order it. If you're just looking to sit outside and have a couple beers, this place is fine. If you want great Indian food, there's other places that are better."
4,"Food was delicious!! Specifically the prawn coriander dimsum. I even forgot to take the picture. . We also ordered another chicken dimsum (this was a bit ordinary), cashew chicken and fried fish. All of them were super tasty. Probably best chinese food i have ever eaten in Germany."
0,Good food but the waiter charged me 3 euro for a glass of water.... not happy at all.
2,"The Bullerei is located in a great location: a red brick building where the former slaughterhouses of Hamburg were located. This restaurant seems to get a lot of fame and attention from its celebrity TV chef Tim Mälzer, who owns it.Service was good and attentive, the food was good, but nothing special, prices are quite high for what you get. They specialize in meat, so that is maybe better, I did not have that since that costs even more.Not a must do but always a can do. The big open space all seats are in is not that cozy and inviting, for my taste.The Bullerei has a separate ""lunch"" / Deli kind of area in the front with a different menu.Will probably be back casually."
3,Really good wholesome meal. Plenty of home grown German options to choose from. Always feel slightly uncomfortable with the staff- may be my issue since I don't speak fluent German. Sit where you want which is nice. Nice spacious restaurant and they have their own beer selection.
4,"Yum!One of the better values since I've been in Hamburg. I got the Schweinebraten (roast pork. DAT SKIN DOE.), mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut. You can either get a small or large portion, though there wasn't too big of a difference between the two. The small seems to be good enough. They spoke English here. :)DAS GOOT."
4,I didn't try the sweet goodies; instead I had a pasta. Pretty delicious at a very cheap price.
2,"Previously the Milk bar and now the sands bar. Weird name for a pub that is nowhere next to a beach! I went there after watching a movie at the close by Cinemaxx. I was there relatively early, around 9 pm, the place was still empty, so we secured places at the bar.The bartender and the waitress were very nice, and friendly.The clientele however is a bit older. The DJ kept on playing weird old music, and when we asked him to pump it up a bit, and play newer songs he refused, claiming that the average age here is around ""60"" (exageration!) and they wouldn't appreciate it. So besides the crappy music, the drinks were ok, large selection, tasty cocktails. a bit less than 10EUR / long drink which is fine!"
3,"Azeitona's charm comes from its rundown but cozy establishment. Great place to eat really cheap and really good food. I had the mezze for 2 and It was wonderful. My personal favorite: their hummus! The place is perfect to hang out with friends, but it's not that big...so don't plan your next birthday party over there. On the downside, staff might have been very friendly but they were rather inattentive. Also, I had a pomegranate lassi which was not nice at all. It was small and way too sweet (taste was rather artificial). If you want to drink something opt for tea. Other than that, I can't wait to try another dish. Mucho love, D."
4,"Qype City night January '08 brought me here. They had prepared a great set menu for us. Nine dishes, they said, but I'm pretty certain it was more like 12. We had cold dishes to start, glass noodles, cold meats, tofu & garlic, etc. That wasn't really my thing, but each successive course brought better and better food. One course brought some really great prawns. They were messy to eat, but delicious. After the two (or three, I forget) main courses came some amazing soup, and after that we got one small sweet dish. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it seemed like dates covered in dough, rolled in sesame seeds. The best chinese food I've had in Hamburg (Ok, I've not really had much chinese food, but still :)"
4,"Spent a whole evening here recently, and a great time was had by all. Free table football - big bonus. The idea of this place is it's set out like a three room flat. Walk through the front door into the kitchen/utility room. In the back there is a living room, then further back still is the bedroom (also where you'll find the table football table, oddly. Update: We went to 3 Zimmer Wohnung again last night and I accidently found out that theyve massively expanded! Basically I was looking for the toilet (having never been to them here before) and took a wrong turn in the maze downstairs which landed me in the table-football room. After talking to the barman it seems that they only opened the room up a few weeks ago. So the upstairs is the same 3 Room Flat that we've always known, but downstairs there is a new long room with a few sofas, a second bar and 6 table-football tables. Yes, 6. It's quite a cool game, but it's depressing how good all the locals are at it..."
4,"Amazing presentation, delicious food, discreet service and lovely view  always forget how nice it is here!"
4,"Great burgers, nice staff, and plenty of outside seating protected from the rain."
4,"With what appears to be a well stocked bar, and a menu with lots of options, I'm having a difficult time deciding which options to take.I'll keep it simple and order a beer to help me decide on the meal.I chose theHähnchenbrustfilet mit Pfefferkornsauce und rostbrot (chicken breast filet, with peppercorn sauce and oven roasted bread).It was nicely prepared and presented.Tasty meal for my last night in Hamburg."
3,"I like the ambiente very much, never eaten there though, only nachos and it was very average. The beer is shots are nice!"
0,"The food is really average, had a quinoa bowl, just a lot of over cooked quinoa with nothing in it, it came with vegetables with poor quality and no flavor... a sad boring vegan restaurant, vegan food is so much more than that !!"
4,"Monday night at 8:30 is free jazz auf dem Feuerschiff! A short and scenic walk along the harbor then, ""all aboard!"" The boat stays stationary so you don't have to worry about not wanting to stay all evening or in case you are prone to getting seasick. You are free to come and go as you please. Jazz music is played below deck where there is also a bar with some seating and a number of tables for dining as well. Fun atmosphere, good times, and good music."
0,Walked in with 2 friends and was seated in a good seat by the window.  3 minutes later another waiter came up and demanded we move to another table same size but in the back by the busy kitchen and bathroom stairs.  He was rude about it and could have just taken one of the chairs we had if he needed it for other people.  Who cares about the food when the atmosphere starts with a rude slap in the face.
4,Their cappuccinos are great. TheIr espresso is medium to dark roast which suits my personal preference. No big bubbles on the foam and the milk was heated to the right temperature. The decoration is great and overall the place has a really nice vibe to it.
4,"Incredible food, great wine selection, service was excellent, and ooo the deserts were to die for. A must try while in Hamburg."
4,"This is perhaps one of the most German things that you can see. The attention to detail is incredible, and the scale is a sprawling reconstruction of various parts of the world that spans two floors and is still growing. The lights actually change color on a timer to create a night and day cycle, and the cycle moves through the rooms as though the sun is moving across the sky. It's all connected! There are hidden jokes and details everywhere. A flying saucer comes down in one spot during the night for an abduction. There is a corpse in the river in another with a coroner parked nearby. Still, definitely great for kids or adults. The sets are interactive, with buttons throughout to trigger events. Very fun, took about two hours."
3,"Despite being really close to the office, I hadn't yet been to Brook - maybe because it is a little bit more expensive than our usual quick lunch places! However, I thoroughly recommend it as lunchtime business venue or evening romantic spot. Situated on the busy Bei den Muhren, overlooking the water, we were able to watch the usual Hamburg weather (bright sunshine then aggressive winds and then torrential rain) rush past in the space of a relaxing 1.5 hours The restaurant itself is large and spacious with an open and modern design. Window tables such as we had I think will be much more pleasant than the inner tables. The 3 course daily lunch menu was excellent and very decent value for this quality of food: A lovely and delicate / frothy asparagus soup, tuna steak on a tomato risotto and a delicate fruit tart with ice-cream. Only minor quibble would be the speed of service - fine for a leisurely evening meal, but perhaps a little slow for a lunchtime off the set menu. But overall a really good discovery. I will be back."
3,Good: Strong modern vietnamese dishes. Tasty and unique.Not so good: Portions ran on the medium-smaller side. We just had to order more.
4,"This museum is super interesting and was worth every minute of our visit. The guides were super polite and helpful. Our visit consisted of putting yourself in a blind person's shoes; we navigated through a dark room and did everyday activities. To make the visit more lifelike, the guides were seeing-impaired so they have expertise and knowledge for the activity. Everyone was polite, friendly, and had an amazing attitude. I recommend this place for everybody that comes to Hamburg and is looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
3,"We were hungry after a day of racing, but wanted some Hamburg panfish. We sat outside, and had a great meal. Not a bargain, but, with the great environment, and helpful staff, we were very happy. The roast beef was served cold, which is nice on a summer day, and the Swiss soup is nice with a celery base. Yum."
3,Quaint little spot. Perfect for a latte and a cake. Very good spot to sit and relax. Nice selection of baked goods and coffee is not too strong. There is a WC in the back which was very clean.
3,Great food and good service. Food came out quite fast considering how busy it was. Also portions was generous.
3,"Such a cool find thanks to my awesome hubby who planned a surprise date here :)Free jazz Mondays (the band was great!), fairly priced drinks, chill crowd all inside an old fire boat-it was a lovely night indeed. I highly recommend checking out Das Fueurschiff!"
1,"Oh Lord, seriously, it's not that good, pretty below-average actually.For starters the food is expensive, and quality wise no better than average. What made things worse is that my vegetables were cold, so were my colleague's, and that made for a pretty crappy meal. I wonder what sort of system they have in the kitchen where the veggies end up cold by the time you get your plate.We sat outside and I thought the service was fairly inattentive, you really had to gesticulate to try and catch a waiter - the Greek restaurant to the right Olympisches Feuer, on the other hand are much more attentive, and is a better bet for a nicer meal.Lastly I ordered a Sagres from tap and it just didn't taste right. It was carbonated, but I suspect perhaps the lines hadn't been cleaner properly - it just had an off taste that made my stomach start to turn, you know, as if you had a bit of bacteria you didn't want to have. Nothing major, you get that as a beer drinker, but, not very good quality sadly, and I thought that Sagres being a Portuguese beer (as far as I know) would have at least tasted good from a Portuguese restaurant.It's another one of those cases where they have a great location on ""the strip"" and they don't have to make an effort, and people still come and eat there.Look I agree the location is nice.  But seriously go to the Olympisches Feuer just to the right, the service, food, value is all a touch better and you'l still be on the strip."
3,"Was there once , quiet atmosphere, a bit lack of character considering  middle eastern  . The waiter was little bit serous face , could be more  welcoming , smily and energetic. However the service was good , food is good quality too  although small portions for big belly :) Small menu but they do well what they offer .Price suits to what other restaurants offer in same area ."
4,"This place is amazing. There are three floors of very detailed exhibits. The special exhibit on the history of Germany, a comparison of various time periods, was especially fascinating. I would have enjoyed an accompanying audio tour."
3,"Great food and location, amazing view. Nice bar to continue the evening after dinner."
0,"As a Pakistani, I was very disappointed with the dining experience here. Maybe I'm used to more traditional Pakistani food (from Karachi), but I was open and curious to trying Balochi style dishes. We ordered samosas, chicken tikka masala and karaih lamb. There was a stone or something very hard, possible a bone piece, in one of the samosas (vegetarian). We told the server and he said sorry, but nothing beyond that. It was hard enough to shatter a tooth if bitten on aggressively. Next, the main dishes were very mediocre - not very tasty, but most of all the portion size was ridiculously small. I was astonished at how little was provided in each dish. There wasn't enough for even one person, and each dish was 14 Euro. Not to mention that one order of samosas only had one actual samosa in it. I've never seen that at any desi restaurant ever. After ordering those 3 dishes and paying 45 euro we were still hungry. As if we didn't even eat. So we cut our losses and left to eat somewhere else. I would not recommend this restaurant. I just moved to the Hamburg area and still am in search of THE Pakistani restaurant I will go to when I'm craving my mom's food. This one failed horribly."
3,Super Restaurant wenn man in Feierlaune ist. Leider ist das Personal immer etwas unterbesetzt und es kann teilweise lange dauern bis das Essen kommt. Die Trüffelpasta ist der Hammer! Und Lillo als guter Gastgeber reist alles wieder raus.
4,"OMG Winterhude has a cosy coffee shop with wifi! Cute, not so little coffee and brekkie place with friendly service. Good coffee. And they had some teas too. Can't believe I didn't know this place all along. This place can be a good work from coffee shop place :)"
4,"It's a burger bar, not a 5 star restaurant, but we had a 5 star experience. It was recommend to us by our local bike tour leader as the best burger in Hamburg. We don't have any other hamburger experiences in Hamburg to compare, but we believe he didn't lie when he said that he's tested them all!It's busy so expect to wait for a table. We sat outside with a pitcher of beer. (For some unknown reason they wouldn't serve food outside.)We were seated in about 15 minutes.The burger choices are extensive. We had one farmhouse burger, one blue cheese burger and one vegetarian burger made from halloumi cheese. There were several vegetarian/vegan options, but I've never seen halloumi cheese offered as a burger, so I had to try it. It was great!The farmhouse burger was a great surprise. It was a tower of meat that could easily feed a family of 6. Not what we were expecting. I think something got lost in the German translation. It was impressive even though my husband can only eat a small portion of it. Each burger was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and the quality of meat was very good. For sides we had fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. The truffle Mayo For dipping was delicious.It was not a healthy dinner by any means. The piece of lettuce on the burger does not count as a serving of vegetable! But if you only want 1 burger in hamburger, this is an excellent choice."
3,The food at this place is great and creative! I guess one of the most fun kitchens and quality on the Lange Reihe... With regards to service they can definitely improve and I leave it at that... The restaurant is simply worth a visit!!!
3,"For work reasons I wanted to try new Catering restaurants. Not only those the food tastes good, they are efficient, fast and know what their clients want! They come on time and are extremely friendly. Totally recommend them!"
2,The english breakfast was suitable and quick. Other than the waitress who seemed to hate life this place was satisfactory.
4,"Very nice smell as we walked in! A smell of fresh backed croissant. Pls reserve the table coz the cafe is not really big. Suitable for kids: baby chair, diaper change table and a box with books and drawing pens are available"
1,Too bad. I was not impressed. I had the Rotbarsch Filet. It was greatly disappointing. Absolutely no flavor. The portion was meager. There was a lot more Kartoffelsalat than fish on the plate. Definitely will not go again.
4,"Located on the ""high street"" of Barmbek on the Fuhlsbüttler strasse small thai/chinese restaurant. In my opinion they make the best peking soup ever! Cheap but very good quality! Highly recommended!"
3,This Jim Block restaurant is located close to Gänsemarkt. It is nicely decorated and clean. The staff was very nice and the food was good. It is a great fast food alternative.The entrance is even with the ground.
3,"I'm not from Hamburg, but it seems to be a cool coffee house, with reasonable prices! Our couchsurfer took us there, and he knows the people running this joint. I took a red tea which was good. The Sunday brunch seems tasty and diverse. Since I am a vegan, I didn't find much to eat there, therefore didn't order it. I would be happy to see some more vegetables and maybe avocado or something that us vegan can eat."
4,"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday...delicious eggs with Krabben (little shrimp from the North Sea), good croissants and brötchen, top notch butter and marmalade, good coffee, excellent service. Sweet little place with tables outside, but not too many."
1,"The food was amazing. And it's such a cosy venue.The service, however, was pretty bad. Our waitress tried very hard, and was very friendly. But:- Apparently the person showing guests the tables was new, and she sent everyone to tables serviced by the same waitress.- As a result, every time we wanted to order drinks or food, it took ages to order, and even longer to arrive.- After waiting an hour for our food, it turned out the kitchen lost our order (and of the table next to us), and we had to wait ages again for our food. Not sure the good food outweighted the huge wait."
4,So neat! It is 2 floors for very detailed sceneries. Spent about an hr and a half there and definitely could use more time if it wasn't closing. The best part was the replica of the airport with planes taking off and landing.
3,"Really cute crepes place with delicious crepes! This place gets really packed sometimes as it may be a little touristy but the crepes quality is great! We walked in over the weekend and managed to grab a table for 2 fairly easily. Seems like if you have a larger group or are coming at peak times, you may want to make a reservation ahead of time.Once we got seated, we started with just 2 cups of espresso. Later on I found out I should have ordered one of the ciders. I did see the table next to us order a bottle of cider and poured it into 2 cute tea cups! Ahhh I should have ordered that! Next time! Ok so we had our espressos which were great! then we ordered our savory crepes and also put in an order for our dessert ones. I don't remember the names of our savory crepes but really everything is really good so just pick one! For the dessert crepes we had the plain sugar with butter and also a nutella crepe. Nutella crepes are always delish but I find it a little to rich for my taste. I enjoyed my simple desert crepe. I really wanted the crepe with sugar and lemon but forgot to order the lemon. It was still really good but yes, I need to come back here! :)Overall it's a great place for an afternoon crepe if you are sightseeing or just want a lighter lunch!"
3,"The food of Tatı was good. Just some pity thinks are,  that they making the crepes with Emmentaler. Normally use should be e.g. Morbie. Second is that I couldn't enjoy my crepes so much. It wasn't like a normal Bretagne crepes all in one. On my crepes all ingredients was separate,  that made it hard to eat. The quiche was really good."
4,"This is my new favorite burger place in Hamburg. It has claimed the number one spot over two other great burger places. Their burgers are a nice size, but don't leave you feeling bloated when you finish. Their fries are perfectly cooked. Their beverages are also great. The service staff is attentive and very quick. All in all I would say this place is a must go. If you love burgers and either love in Hamburg or are planning to visit Hamburg, this is the place for you. We've been here a couple of times, and this place is yet to disappoint. The Mr. T burger isy personal favorite choice. Can't go wrong with that."
4,"My absolute favorite place to spend a leisurely Sunday morning meal. Eating fresh fruit, quark, reading a magazine, and listening to the conversations of others is all part of the appeal of Cafe Zeitraum. It's like being served in a friend's comfortable living room."
3,"I came here with some friends for a Monday evening dinner. The place was absolutely packed, so I'd definitely recommend a reservation if you're heading there outside of lunch. Luckily, we had one and were seated within a few minutes of arriving even though our party of 3 wasn't entirely here yet.The decor and ambience is certainly unique. In a good way, that is. The walls are decked out with what seems like a random collection of flea market finds, and the entirely unrelated music selection works to complete the experience. The waiters are also super high energy and witty, with an almost relentless desire to practice their heavily Italian-accented English. Our table was in a back corner, which made it easy to chat despite the somewhat loud setting. I'm not sure if that would also apply with the more central tables in the space.My friends recommended the pizzas over the pastas, and that seemed to match past reviews as well as what I saw around me. I got the Prosciutto e Funghi pizza. It's probably the best pizza I've had in Hamburg: really thin dough that's nicely charred from their wood-burning oven with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. These pizzas are huge, probably over 14"" in diameter, but the thin dough and toppings makes for a lighter meal than your typical, smaller pizza.At the end of the meal, they drop off the check along with bottles of grappa and sambuca and shot glasses for you to pour away. It's a nice way to end the meal even if the gesture felt a little robotic. The fruit chews accompanying that felt a little out of place, though.If you're in search for a good pizza in Hamburg or just a fun dinner out, definitely check out Luigis."
4,"I'm always a little leery of expensive restaurants with a great view. Most of the time it feels like you're only paying for the view and the food is an afterthought. Not the case here. The food is fresh, innovative and fantastic. The service is great. The view is amazing."
1,Staff is far not that friendly as in the US but ok. Food is good!!
1,"It's big, it's tacky, but it's on the Reeperbahn, so that's kinda expected. One thing that you might not expect is that it would be quite so expensive. A weizen here will set you back a whopping EUR3.90! Before 8pm cocktails are EUR5.50, which is ok. I can't see any other reason for coming in though"
4,"Rodizio is one of my fave restaurant here in Hamburg. The price is abit steep, but for the amount of food you will get at their eat-all-you-can , it is worth it esp for meat lovers. The 'servers' go around with their meats/side dishes from table to table. They will serve it to you straight to your plate. If it's a meat, they will slice it infront of you. You need to book with them 3-4weeks in advance if you wish to dine with them on a Saturday night. If you are looking for a ""quiet"" place to dine, this is NOT for you. If you wanted to go for 'ala carte', again - this place is NOT for you."
3,"Delicious Pakistani food and great service (which is completely unexpected in Germany!) This is one of several locations in the city and my favorite because you can either have a nice sit-down meal in the gorgeous restaurant or have a quick meal in the little ""imbiss"" (snack) on the right side. The restaurant is beautiful with carved wood, lit candles, tiled walls and flooring, and the choice of sitting at tables with chairs or on cushions on the ground. In the snack side you can order from essentially the same menu although it it much cheaper  and a little quicker. Great curries and platters, yummy cocktails, and quick and friendly service. Definitely recommended."
4,Very good sushi and other dishes! Very nice waiters and good quality fish! Very recommendable!
3,"i am visiting vesper since few months. it has an elegant decorative style, large windows give a lot and make the place comfortably spacious, home-made good quality cakes are always delicious... the service crew is precise and very friendly, they make no mistakes. I had few times dinner and i was not disappointed."
4,"For me this is the perfect burger place. The sizes of the burgers with a side are perfect for lunch. The taste is different, yet very much on point burgers with the perfect amount of asian flavors. The ambience and service is perfect. I would go here for a mid day burger anytime."
4,"This museum was really amazing. It reminded me of the Natural History Museum in NYC, but without the barriers between you and the animals. You could get really close to the preserved animals and it made for a very interesting experience that really gave you a better sense of what the animals are like (you don't realize how big a grizzly is until you stand up next to it)."
4,"Great food (especially fish and seafood), great service, great location, great atmosphere  THE place for perfect dinner, be it romantic for two or family or dinner with your visitors in Hamburg. It is not cheap and little bit of touristy, but every bite is worth it."
4,"This is my favorite restaurant for a German lunch in Hamburg. If you want a 'lighter' meal, I suggest getting a sandwich. I always get the one with Rindfleisch (beef). Never been disappointed here, always good quality!"
4,"This is *the* place to meet locals. Germans themselves say Hamburg people are reserved, but I don't agree. If you want to see reserved,  go to Sweden or google ""waiting for the bus like a swede"".Any given Friday, the place is *packed*, and not just the inside, but there's a huge crowd outside too. I love that they allow drinks outdoors. (There's a 1€ deposit for glasses, which is what you as a non German speaker won't understand that they're trying to tell you when you order.)There's happy hour until 22, which means you can order cheap drinks through a hole in a door in the back,  if you keep going past the bar.If you pass the drink hole there's a kicker table in there too.Restroom is downstairs.But I'd just recommend talking to the friendly Germans out front, so here's a few conversation starters to get you going:""What did you do last time it wasn't raining?""""Did you know that 'Katze' means cat?""or my personal favorite:""Hi, mind if I bother you a little?""(But please respect people who do mind...)"
4,This is our regular as well as special Sushi place in Hamburg. Always an-above-average quality and never tiring variety of sushi :)
4,"Great food, nice service, good atmosphere! You get a tasty treat of flat bread with olive oil and an herb mix to enjoy while you're waiting for your mealand it's worth the wait. Unique flavors, trendy style. More of a fusion/modern cuisine than Lebanese  excellent food! Be sure to reserve a seat if you want to go on the weekend."
4,"I've been here multiple times over a few years, and never fail to be impressed.  Most recently for lunch, the efficiency, quality, and charm - - at an incredible price - - is something just jaw-dropping.  Nice thin crust, ingredients with abandon and flair,  remarkable service, fun vibe - - Luigi's continues to blow me away.  The experience can vary depending on whether you get there when it is packed (which it generally is) or you can breeze in and get a table (worth timing your visit to make this a possibility).   But no matter what, and no matter when, you will have some super tasty pizza, and a vivid experience."
4,"Have always had a great experience here. The interiors are very cool and the cocktails are very good. Let's just say the drinks are complicated in a good way. Only problem sometimes, it can get super crowded."
3,"I love the french toast with maple syrup and fresh freuit. for 5,00€ i think it is a pretty good deal.I'm tempted to try out the salads but I know that my bill will be a LOT more expensive. but I'm sure it is all very delicious!the place is always PACKED on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/Brunch... if you don't reserve, you might not have a chance.my only disappointment is that they list red velvet cupcakes on their website as a kind of the baked goods, but I've been there several times and they never have them available. :-(  whyyyy?!?!  i would be so many and so often. ;-)"
3,"I've loved eating at Jim Block ever since I came to Hamburg and was excited to hear that they'd be opening a restaurant closer to the inner city and my workplace. Foolishly, I tried going there for lunch a few days ago and it was simply impossible - the line to order was so long that it extended beyond and out the front door. When I did finally manage to find a day which wasn't completely packed (Saturday night, surprisingly), I ordered a veggie burger and was somewhat disappointed. See, when I think of veggie burger, I think of a vegetable-based patty inside a bun. Jim Block's idea of a veggie burger is to throw a handful of mushrooms inside the bun and call it a burger, which we all know is blasphemy. One star off the rating for this obvious abomination. Besides this issue, Jim Block remains one of the best places in town to get a burger - it's local, fresh, affordable and doesn't make you feel like your arteries are clogging up while you eat."
4,Awesome!!!!!  Fabulous food. Great service too.  The Basil soup was to die for.  A must have
3,"This is a great place. When I see Döner queen, I feel like to hang out there with friends. Foods are cheap and good quality."
4,"I went there on a saturday morning for a breakfast/brunch and choose the breakfast buffet order. The place is super cozy, decoration is fancy and comfy and it never felt too crowded. The buffet had great food and a lot of options for either regular, lowcarb, paleo and veggie. You can drink as much coffee as you want with the buffet and they also include fresh made scrambled eggs that tasted divine. It's a suitable place for couples and families, totally worth your money."
2,I must admitting it's rare that I come across REALLY good Italian food. And this wasn't one of those rare times. The food wasn't that well prepared. And the pizzas were simply boring - tasting most of all a bit prefabricated.
3,"Get a hamburger in Hamburg (the origin city of the hamburger). This was a major priority in my plan when visiting this city. After passing by some other Yelp recommendations, I finally decided to take the train out here before checking out the St. Pauli Christmas Market nearby. It's about a 5-7 minute walk from the train stop.Arriving in the evening, the place was packed. As in, every single seat was taken. I tried to seat myself at the bar, only to be informed that I still had to put my name down because there were slots of reservations. No biggie. I was fine waiting. Except it seemed like I waited for half an hour or more as I watched groups of people walk in and get seated without reservations. Turns out the hostess thought I was also waiting for a dining companion to arrive thus the multiple snubs. Well, that tells you something about going out to eat by yourself at restaurants here. Rare stuff.Anyway, I finally got to sit at the bar and already having familiarized myself with the menu--there is an awesome disclaimer on the front page about what to expect with their food and how to eat it--I ordered a burger, fries, and beer. It was a hefty portion and the interestingly English-muffin-like bun was tiny compared to the patty, but a decent American-esque meal. Service was fine. Given the crowds, the popularity of The Bird speaks for itself. It's a good place to eat some good food and for the locals to get a taste of the stateside stuff. Seemed like a very social scene in there. The most important tip I will offer you is this: CASH ONLY."
0,"The service was TERRIBLE and the food was mediocre at best. I had high expectations for this restaurant since they served American style breakfast. As a fellow American, I could have stayed home and made my own pancakes. Their pancakes were not moist and the chocolate chips were not cooked within the pancake. The sandwich my husband order could have been made in 10 minutes at most. It was just a sandwich with tomato, lettuce, and fake bacon. It took over 45 minutes to deliver our food! I'm not sure why this place has high ratings."
4,"At first glance Ti Breizh was odd. There was only one outdoor bench and the first section of the restaurant appeared to be a store of some kind, sorry I never found out. This is because we were led out back to the deck-top seating on the canal behind the buildings. So fun! Apparently there are three floors of seating indoors as well.We split two savory crepes, one loaded with 4 toppings and one simple with just cheese. This was perfect as we split the toppings up and had plenty.The creamed mushrooms were much better than I anticipated, and the spinach and onions were great options too.We finished with a sweet crepe, the one with cherries and rum. It was very good, but I'd say I enjoyed the savory crepes even more. If I lived in Hamburg, I'd come back for sure!"
3,"A very good pizza. Although wouldn't be bad if they would cut the pizza or bring a pizza knife/roller. The place is nice, cool and the service is very nice and warm."
4,Loved this place. Was so cute inside and the tapas were awesome! Def coming back again maybe during the happy hour when the food is discounted. Can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommend.
3,"Had a day in Hamburg and a friend brought us here.  Did not like it that I had to give up my bottled water at the door... did they think I'l not order a drink and just sip my water in there?! Once in, the place was great. Feel like I was on a sandy beach bar somewhere else in the world.   Then the rain come down like crazy & everyone squeezed into the covered bar area...dancing to the music.  So much fun, very memorable!  Highly recommend it !"
2,"I've never been to this style of restaurant before and found it rather amusing. Whilst the food wasnt exactly 5 star, there is plenty of it and the quality was good. I was in a group of 4 and we found the service to be quick, polite and attentive. Whilst the visit was on a Tuesday evening (not exactly prime time) the atmosphere was good. If you love ample portions and no frills dining I'd recommend this restaurant."
3,"Nice place to go and get just about everything, and it all tastes good too! Lots of students and a relaxed atmosphereif you can get a table. If it's nice weather, you can enjoy the outdoor seating. Apothecary decorations and friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices and huge selection for good quality, normal food."
4,"Well known to hamburgers, but something of a secret for people from out of town, it's taken me 3 years to get there!Tucked away behind the exhibition halls in Lagerstrasse you go through what appears to be a Culinary Wholesaler, up an industrial staircase and enter a world of meat. Yes it's almost a palace dedicated to the consumption of flesh.Beautifully laid tables and Napiery, serious steak knives, great bread,  four types of salt, a warm greeting, promised that what would was to follow would satisfy deeply.I was just there for the meat and ordered a steak medium rare with some gratin potatoes. Delicious flavoursome meat. A very generous 250grams. I was in heaven. Hear fish is amazing too."
4,"Good food and great service. I would have given this place 4 stars but added one star for the owner/chef who was personally serving us; this guy is great and funny too. It is a small place and so not good for big groups. They have a set menu (which supposedly changes every week or so) but if you like seafood, you should try it. The price is OK for Hamburg."
3,"I was there with a group of friends from Japón and my boyfriend. Their love the sashimi, the quality is the fish was good and of course fresh. I was exciting because of the yakitory, but it was the worst dish from the table.I'll try to go again to give them another change."
4,"This is a good chinese place!The food is premium quality. We were 4 persons so we took the Tsingtao Menu.It consisted of a soup, springrolls, duck, beef, chicken and lamb and of course rice à gogo! Everything was delicious. We were sat at a table with a rotating part in the middle, so we were able to pass around the plates without making a mess! The restaurant is not cheap but its worth every penny"
3,"Luigis is a quite nice italian restaurant in the quater Neustadt, also calles portuguese quater. The pizzas are like the pizzas in Italy. The pizza toppings are from very good quality and the various daily menu offers always nice new and traditional pizzas. The pasta is also original italian style.The pizzas are big and crispy. Their quality is excellent and you will not find easy a pizza backery like this in Hamburg.If you want to visit Luigis at the evening, you should better have an reservation. Its always difficult to get a table at the evenings. I can only give this restaurant five stars because of the staff. The staff is italian, but they are always a little bit craggy. But the service is fast and good.I recommend this restaurant for a quick but good lunch or dinner for families and groups, but not for a rendevous."
3,Don't know much about sushi. But at least that one was the best i've ever had. I recommend the beef topping.
4,"Nice little vietnamese restaurant with good food and even better prices. I've only ever stopped by there for take aways, but the place itself is very nicely decorated and has a nice modern atmosphere. Every time I stopped by there to pick up some food to take home (and it's been quite a few times), the service was really friendly, the food was made very quickly on the spot and it all tasted great when I got home.It seems to be run by pretty young and hip vietnamese people who are super friendly, and the prices are really low for the quality and quantity of food you get. All in all, this place is highly recommended."
1,"I was here 3 times. The first 2 times I came here with one person. The food were super super good, then I brought my other 3 friends here with full expectations but we all were disappointed this time. May be we came there at a wrong time (Easter time) or their main chef is on holiday, no idea. They offer Surprises Menu all the time. The first 2 time (2 persons), we had 6 warm+cold appentisers but this time 4 persons only had 5 appentisers and the portion was the same as for 2 persons. The beef was tough and no sauce for the whole dish. When we asked for a ketchup or sauce and they answered it is not their practice to offer sauce. We are very disappointed and don't know what is going on in this restaurant."
3,"Very good! Can't believe it took me 5 years to try the place. Now I know why it was always so busy.My only negative is that the portions aren't consistent, I've noticed some customers getting preferential treatment with much more toppings, and this made me sad. Why do you hate me, Kumpir König!?"
3,Good location and delicious cakes. But the wifi is very slow when I wanted to use it on my Macbook.
2,their pasta and pizza of the day with Apple soda during lunch time is a good deal (around 6 to 7 eur).
4,"I just loved the atmosphere here. It was very full but the service was great and the hearty food hit the spot. I wanted to linger and take in the interesting surroundings of the old apothecary shop. I'll put this at the top of my visit list next time I'm in Hamburg. Give it a try. It bistro style,not flashy, but honest and enjoyable."
4,"A lot of Asian food in Germany is ""verdeutscht"" as is a significant amount of Asian food Americanized in the States. But coming from NY, you get such a wide array of pretty authentic Asian dishes. Bok avoids becoming like the throngs of fast food noodle joints in Hamburg and offers up some of the best Asian food, I think, you'll get in Hamburg."
4,"This restaurant is located on a small cobblestone street close to Hafen City. The restuarant itself is very small and they only have one table for up to 5 people outside and indoor seating as well. I went there during a non busy time and the place was empty. The lady working behind the counter was really nice and recommended the blackfish with the potatoes and a side salad. I am really glad i took the reccomendation the food was abosolutely delicious! The fish was very fresh and delicious and the potatoes were cooked to perfection. The side salad wasnt bad either! They have fritz cola as well. Between the excellent service, the food, location and price I was really glad I decided to stop by."
0,"I would not suggest this restaurant and will never ever go there again. The foods are not fresh at all and the waiters are very unfriendly. AND i, and my mother got a stomachache right after!! It might be the worst restaurant i have ever been in this world!"
4,"Excellent little quiet bar, great beers, friendly staff, food looked very good, though we didn't eat here ourselves"
4,This place is amazing! Delicious German cuisine. We had the Spätzel with meatloaf and the Maultaschen with egg. We are going back on Sunday before we return to Copenhagen.
1,"- this place is way way over rated- very friendly service and good beer, and place is always full which is fun. - also very family friendly so that's all good, however the steaks and the burger are really not great.- steaks look ok and are cooked ok, but they just do not taste of much unfortunately, you will not find any good variety Scottish, Argentinian or Swiss staff here.- unfortunately I also have to score their burger down. The New York cheeseburger is not in fact a burger. The meat tastes like an Italian meatloaf, and it's basically served on a crusty half slice Italian bread, with thin chips and cheese. It tastes ok, but it should be called the Italian sandwich not a cheese burger.- unlikely that I will eat steak or burger her again"
3,"Happy hour EUR5 cocktails until 9pm. EUR3.50 Augustiner Brau. Cool interior, good central Altona location. It does have a bit of a problem with very awkwardly sized and positioned tables, but otherwise it's a cool bar."
1,"Should have listened to the reviews. We waited an hour (we were told upfront though that we'd have to wait a bit as they were too busy until 4pm) but it was quite a let-down especially for the price. Two meager lamb ""bon-bons"" on sautéed spinach and boiled potatoes. Dry bird on the same spinach-potato bed in some canned tasting tomato-sauce. The only good thing was the homemade tea lemonade. Ambience is ok but overpriced and meh. Lackluster service. Spend your dollars elsewhere."
4,"This restaurant is AMAZING.  Visiting Hamburg on vacation from the states and we couldn't have chosen a better spot. This restaurant was a 5 min walk from our apartment in the quaint neighborhood of St George.  Inside, the atmosphere/decor carries the charm and history of Hamburg that we were seeking in a true German experience.  We cannot sing the praises of our server, Lokman (or Baran as he is known there), enough.  He was wonderfully charming and accommodating to our ""american-ness"". He patiently lead us through the menu and engaged in entertaining, witty conversation Now for our food.  OUR FOOD.  Every bite was amazing!   Our party had everything from the ""summerly radishes soup"" to my dish, ""Our Pfundskerl"" (meatball with asparagus and noodles)   Everything was exceptional.  Each mouthwatering dish was flavorful and melted in your mouthWe cannot speak highly enough of our experience at Das Dorf"
2,"Came here looking for the infamous last drink, after dinner but, before going home!Impressed that I was able to find somewhere to hang up my coat let alone be able to get to the bar and have service!!  whoop whoop.  Quick with delivering out cocktails we were also able to find some table space.  All this in the run up to Christmas, cold night and in a reasonably packed bar.Dimmed lighting and music providing fun atmosphere.Friendly staff and people.  Towards the end of the night, we even had table service a plus for me.  Gotta love table service in a bar!!The only downside to this bar was the ability to smoke inside.  Not a fan of smoking and not used to smoking inside for a while now, this was a shock to the system, my clothes, hair and lungs.This, for me was the only down side to this bar.  Although, would come again.  :)"
4,"Excellent vegetarian food! Great tastes to experience, well-made food. Service was a bit slow, but the food was well worth it! Also a nice seating area outside."
2,"Slightly cozier than sister locale mi-chii with all its concrete, the original O-ren Ishii is still geared toward fast eating prior to dinner hours, with five changing dishes every day, all around 10-13€. Benches and stools are simple, hard, with very few seats even boasting as much as a backrest.Food started more pleasantly, with a delicious spicy home-made lemonade. This was followed by absolutely brilliant spring rolls; airy, crispy, just perfection on a bed of fresh herbs. Do not miss out on those if you eat here!Unfortunately, my main course let me down again: I got a Vietnamese-style rice bowl with a generous helping of chicken, but they somehow managed to make a ginger-chili sauce dull and boring. A spicy, bland dish, and no other sauces or dressings available to at least dilettante things up...As much as I loved the starter course: the bland main, as well as the uncomfortable seating would not entice me back."
4,My friend told me that this is his favourite steak house in Hamburg. And he will come to the restaurant every time when he is in Hamburg. I order the lamb and it is really good. It taste very juicy and tender.
2,"Visited for the first time last night, and had high expectations given the hype over the opening. The location is great, the service was friendly (and multilingual), but in the end my food was just okay, and the prices are a bit high.We reserved a table online (nice), and the hostess seated us quickly out in the pedestrian area where there are several dozen tables set up. Our waiter was a friendly guy who offered the English speakers in our group English-language menus, and was available and helpful throughout the evening. I ordered the crispy fish burger with a side of fries, and the whole situation was kind of a mess. First, it's not really a burger; they should rename it a sandwich, because it's just a fried fish sandwich. Second, my sandwich was absolutely drenched in Remoulade (tartar sauce), which made it a mess to pick up and eat. So I went after it with knife and fork (German-style), but that crushed the tender fish inside the bun, which made it less like eating a filet of fish, and more like eating a flattened fish paste. The fries were fine, almost great. Sauces for fries (mayo, ketchup) are extra, something I just don't understand. Total cost for sandwich, fries, mayo: 14 Euro. Seems overpriced by at least 30%.I may give them another chance, but the first impression was not strong."
2,"Right across from the Hauptbahnhof stands Nagel, one of the many German restaurants ín the city centre trying to attract tourists. It is nicely decorated, roomy and clean with interesting art-work on the walls. The menu choice is respectable as is the choice of drinks and the prices.My only complaint with this place is that I didn't find it very family friendly. It was made plain clear that my pram was in the way and it was even suggested to me that I should just leave it on the street - despite the fact it had a sleeping baby inside.This is still however a firm favourite for family and friends visiting from the UK"
4,"This is a bloody big bridge. Looks great from a 10 euro boat trip, and you can probably see it even more cheaply if you take the ferry instead. Watching panamax container ships sail under here is awe-inspiring!"
4,"A long line in front of this place hinted that the reviews were legit. Each scoop was 1.40 EUR, a bit more expensive than usual, but you get a taster of another flavour for free, on top. Onto the ice cream itself: one taste of it and we were hooked: the coconut sorbet is quite simply the best coconut ice cream we've ever tasted. It kind of reminded us of Booja-Booja's Coconut Hullabaloo, until now our favourite - only that Luicella's was ten times better. Pistachio was also very good. Highly recommended!"
4,Most amazing place! Great personale and service from the get go! Food soooo delicious -nothing less! Go people! Go!!! Remember only German credit card or cash!Denmark
3,Went here for a business dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I had read many of the good reviews on here and wasn't expecting much. Thankfully I walked out happy. It's a really nice room and a good place for business or private meals. Service was polite and very professional. The menu is higher-end than most places on or near the Lange Reihe. We were quite happy with both our appetisers and main courses and had a great bottle of wine to go with it.....a recombination from the waiter. I'll definitely be back here when entertaining out of town business guests. I also would come with my wife for a romantic dinner. A really solid place which has established itself over the years and is well frequented. I highly recommend reserving a table if you do come.
3,"Even though I speak German, I'll write this review in English for our fellow travelers.We stopped here in summer of 2014 and had a great meal. Everyone in our family likes potatoes so we knew this was going to be good. One really awesome thing was that we were able to beg the waiter to get us some tap water. In case you don't know: No one serves just plain tap water in Europe and drinks of any kind are expensive. We were so thirsty after walking all around the city that we would have maxed out our credit card just on Cokes alone. The waiter kept bringing us carafes full of plain tap water and glasses for no charge - for that alone they have my eternal gratitude!I had the ""Florentiner Spinatauflauf"" - a florentine spinach and potato casserole. Along with the spinach and potato slices in a garlic cream sauce it was also covered in cheese and baked. It was incredibly good. My son had a variety of roasted potatoes and potato pancakes. I forgot what my wife and daughter ate, but it was also very good. We sat outside on the patio on account of the nice weather. Inside was very cozy and dark. Take your pick depending on your mood.If you love potatoes as much as we do, you should definitely try this place. They proudly make potatoes the centerpiece of everything!"
4,"This is so far the best place to eat in Hamburg. Great location. Excellent food. Really the best. Loved herrings, all different kinds of potato dishes. Beer and Schnitzel also. Cute decors."
4,"Sure they started a bit shaky, but after a few months of working through the kinks and finding some great cooks these guys nailed it. Perfect food, casual attitude, good service, and good location. A+"
2,"What I like about this place:1) they give you unagi sauce and mayo with the soy sauce which both taste great! 2) The sushi are Creative and pretty overwhelming in taste. What I dislike:1) The Service and staff is absolutely ridiculous. I understand you guys got some fame now though online ratings but the staff truly doesn't give a shit about you. First time we came we asked if the kitchen is still open if we come in 20 minutes. They said yes, we arrived in 15 minutes to find out their kitchen closed. No apology, just a ""well you've to come earlier"" (but I just talked to you on the phone). Second time we came 2 orders were taken incorrectly and they made us feel guilty about not telling them right away when we got the sushi (well, it all looks the same to us) 2) The sushi quality is middle class. Don't go with the nigiri you'll be disappointed. It's not worth the price. Conclusion: if you like fancy special rolls, you love it when it's saucy - this place is worth to check out. The taste of the special rolls are great! If you care about having a good experience or authentic or quality sushi. Skip this place. Note that parking is a catastrophe! What we ordered and liked ranked from most favorite to least favorite:1) Unique Lady roll (was good!) 2) Crazy Man Roll (nice Sauce that tastes a bit like Marmelade) 3) Hot Strong Tempura roll (would skip) 4) Crispy dream roll (definitely skip)"
2,"The Parlament is hidden in the Rathaus basement?; the reason why I probably have never seen it before.Inside the interior is really majestic and richly ornated. The crowd is a bit older, up against 40.The atmosphere is quite formal, but fits fine with the venue. The food seems to be expensive, but I havent tried it yet. Nice to take your parents, or just enjoy a typically businesslike/historical spot in Hamburg. Tourist or not."
4,"At first, we just went there for hod dogs. It was sunny outside and we were able to put ourselves in the shade to rest (because they don't have space inside). One hot dog cost only 3€ and they add sauces and toppings such as pickles and fried onions. After that, we also took ice cream which was tasty and refreshing."
4,"It is, in fact, as good as they say it is. After hearing for years about how great the bread in Germany is, I've been disappointed now that I actually live here. All of the bakeries seem to churn out the same crappy, lifeless, factory-made bread (and/or pastry). Not so at this bakery.I happened upon Die Kleine Konditorei by happenstance; my mechanic is nearby, and I needed something to do for 30 minutes while they worked on my car. They pointed me here, and I will be forever grateful.I was surprised at first to see a line out the door when I arrived on a random Tuesday morning. In my experience, Germans don't queue for anything, so this must be a good spot. I tried the most German croissant I could find... a sunflower seed pretzel croissant, and it was amazing. I also had a tiny little cheese/bacon puff that looked good (and was).Anyway, delicious baked goods, good prices, long lines. Seems worth it to me. I'll be back."
1,"I went to Casa di Roma a while ago, invited by a friend upon recommendation by the Hotel Atlantic's concierge. While the food was decent, but hardly anything to write home about, the attitude of one manager in particular was rather disgusting. It seemed as if he didn't have a particularly nice day and felt like sharing the feeling with both his employees and guests, which I found utterly unacceptable. The friendly waitress tending our table could only try to limit the damage. Needless to say, I shall never return to Casa di Roma. Since then (listen up, conspiracy theorists worldwide!) I've learned that Casa di Roma is rather frequently recommended by hotel concierges in Hamburg. Personally, I have to wonder why. (Second star awarded personally to the waitress.)"
2,"When XING handed out coupons for free coffee drinks at the new Campus Suite, I was glad to give the place a test-run. Though I can't say I'm a big coffee shop sitter anymore - at least not at big, impersonal chain-type places - I figured it was worth a try.The jury's in: The new place isho-hum. Reminds me of any chain-type coffeeshop in any college town in the states. The woman behind the counter was nice, and I certainly prefer to support a student-run place over Starbuck$, but that's about it. The coffee was fine, but a bit cold and not strong enough. Mine at home is much better, as is the espresso at 'Delikatessen des Meeres' in the Colonnaden (my tip for great coffee and a great lunch, too). How about a new idea for a change?"
2,"If you've ever been to a Dungeon in another city, you know what you're in for. There are English tours available and I highly recommend you book one of those if you don't speak German. You will learn about the history of Hamburg in a very entertaining and interactive way. From the inquisition over the black plague to piracy and the great fire and flood, this establishment puts the fun into history!It's a bit gaudy, but a lot of fun."
3,So cute and cozy and so schwäbisches 'comfort' Essen!  Everything is house made.  You have to order at the counter and they bring food to your table. My spätzle dish and my husband's Maultauschen tasted as if we were at my husband's relative's house in Baden-Württemberg.  Big portions.I had my schwäbisches essen fix at this place.
4,"If it's too warm outside, you will enjoy the different flavored ice-cream such as raspberry basil or strawberry kiwi. You can also choose between different sizes of ice scoops and decide to eat it in a cup or a cone. You can either take away or chill in this nice cosy space. The waiters are friendly and speak English very well."
0,"The lunch buffet sounded like a good deal so we wanted to give it a try. The buffet table was diverse: sushi, Asian salads and main courses. Unfortunately the quality was mediocre, if even that. I usually never try sushi in other than Japanese restaurants and I shouldn't have made an exception. Can you imagine makis filled with leftover spicy salads?I was there with my husband and our baby. During the lunch the baby woke up and cried for a few seconds until we calmed her down. Since there were no other people around (we were pretty much the only customers) I breastfed her, very discreetly, covered by a big scarf. My husband overheard the owner telling to the waitress that they should charge us more since this is unacceptable.In sum: bad food, horrible service and all but family-friendly athmosphere. Avoid the place."
3,I visited this Italian restaurant on my first trip to Germany. Our seat was right in front of the brick oven which was great to see and also the man making the pizza was most entertaining with his singing.  I had a large beer and a tomato and mozzarella appetizer. Let's not forget the main dish a large pizza pie with all the works. If you are not a big eater remember to share. If you have been longing to devour a large pizza pie on your own. Order and dive right in. I will be back on my next trip to Germany with my family.
3,The food quality is good. kebab is authentic.servers could do a better job.
2,"Was waiting for my bus from Hamburg to Berlin and had some time to kill so I wanted a sit down to eat place instead of a form of takeout, I walked around the haubenhauf and found a string of restaurants and after looking at all the posted menus I decided I'd check out Nagel which is a German pub/restaurant, there is plenty of outdoor seating but I opted to sit inside which had plenty of tables and a good ambiance, they had a few different beers and liquors on the menu but I wasn't actually in the mood to have a drink so I opted for a water, for food I have their house salad which was good and had a dressing already on there, I ordered a schnitzel yet again which came with sliced roasted potatoes almost like potato du jour, the schnitzel I ordered came with horseradish sauce I decided to give it a shot and have a dish I really like prepped a little differently, it wasn't bad but I definitely prefer it with the sweeter sauce, overall this is a decent spot that's close to both hamburg's central station and also close to the bus station as well, I think I'd try another spot before trying this one again, not because it was bad but just because it wasn't too memorable to be honest"
3,"Netter, kleiner Laden. Eigentlich super, jedoch konnte ich kein Hähnchen probieren, da gerade kein fertig war. Die Currywurst als Ersatz war ok, könnte jedoch etwas schärfer sein.Werde wohl versuchen eines dieser legendären Hähnchen zu bekommen."
4,This place had bags of potential when it first opened  but now it is absolutely spot on. Friendly people and great waffles and icecream!
3,"Now, this is my kind of coffee bar. Stylish, modern but rustic-chic comfortable and clean. Fairly friendly service, accommodating to our group of 10 (reservation made prior) and quick with the breakfast, coffee and teas. My muesli with yogurt and fresh fruit hit the spot, as did my THREE cappuccinos. I had to restrain myself from eating the potted cheesecake for breakfast, but I so wanted to. The paninis also seem to be a very solid choice. The two larger communal tables are VERY sturdy. In fact a bit hard to get in and out of (as Aaron S mentions), but hey...they surely don't wobble or go uneven! A very nice spot to sit and chat. To read. To enjoy a light lunch or breakfast. Read the paper. Soak in a quick break before you tackle Hamburg. I will definitely return on my next visit. *cash only. There is a cash machine just outside to the right across the street. You'll be able to see it from the front door!"
3,"first time here. Came with a group of people, actually 20 people. Really great for group. Food is great. I order extra no 4, it was pork and lamb skew mix with fries. The meat was nicely grilled. The guy next to me ordered a lamb plate, also looking really good. Probably gonna try it next time. Well, what is funny is I just found out lemonade in Germany is actually sprite. Well maybe I will try beer here next time."
4,"Loved absolutely everything about this place! It's so romantic and cosy, great friendly service, perfect atmosphere and delicious food, desserts and coffee!"
4,"The food was great, the staff were friendly and nice, the place is neat and bright, one of the best Persian restaurant in Europe."
4,"Great place also for vegetarians! Nice people, very good and friendly service. Try the zucchini bratlinge! Love them."
3,"Very nice authentic Mexican restaurant. Good food, and pleasant service. Our waiter didn't know anything about the food or about drinks but he always had a smile on his face which made everything great. Would go here again"
2,"This is a snug, quaint restaurant that serves traditional food from Swabia, a region in south Germany, for lunch and dinner. It's cozy with a peaceful ambiance and specializes in Spätzle (Swabian soft pasta) and Maultaschen (Swabian dumpling). There are many vegetarian and vegan options, as well as an English menu.I tried cheese Spätzle with caramelized onions, sheep's cheese, and smoked tofu (all Spätzle is served with a basic side salad) and Maultaschen stuffed with minced meat and spinach. Both dishes were very fresh tasting with seemingly high quality ingredients and nice preparation. However, I was disappointed as I didn't find either lived up to the mostly outstanding reviews this place has. I thought both were good, but I didn't think either was particularly flavorful. I wouldn't go here expecting an outstanding tasting meal, but nonetheless it's a nice little restaurant to try some authentic food."
4,"YAAASSSS!!!! It can be hard to find this place that's hidden away in a shady-looking building, but do yourself a favor and go! Have some almond coffee, a slice of cheese cake and feel the atmosphere of cool northern Germany. This is hipster in the best way possible and a pleasure to visit. Discreet place, but bursting with atmosphere."
4,"Very good meat, very good pieced together burgers in general. Very comparable to an american chain called BurgerFI. I'll be back on my next visit, thank you."
4,"Amazing Italian food.  If you go, you must try the fresh tagliatelle mixed in a Parmesan wheel with white truffles.  Absolutely divine!Make reservations and go early...as they run out of dishes (especially fish dishes) around 8-9PM.Honestly, you have to love a restaurant that buys their main ingredients fresh every morning and sells out at some point in the night.   You know you are getting the best possible ingredients you can get.You must try at least once!"
3,"Beautiful ""park"" in the middle of a hectic part of the city. Easy to reach from the Alsterkrug Hotel, where we stayed. Not much traffic we met 5 people on a sunny August Monday afternoon, but be aware of the sometimes speeding cyclists ;-) !! You can walk around the lake and the ""Moor"" easily in an hour, or spent much more if you follow each and every trail. Especially if you observe the cute little houses, with their accurate design and trimmed lawn (this is Germany ;-)  and of course some garden gnomes of the ""Kleingartenverein"" parcels around the Moor."
4,"CASA FRANCO FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I came here twice with the company I was working for. Since my boss always paid for everything.BUT I'M SURE IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE :D I think if I'd know the prices, I would pretty much give it ZERO stars hahahah. kidding :)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, what we always got was:HUGE SCAMPIES ROASTET IN OIL + ALCOHOL served in huge flamesA PLATE WITH DIFFERENT FISH FILETS + a unique secret sauce made by FrancoSTEAK, small peaces of steak with different sauces.and more.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Honestly I don't remember it all but I know you get a lot, and all the seafood you get are really really delicious.I remember I dropped the whole steak I picked it up and still ate it, that's how good it was. But I was drunk anyways haha.LOCATION: Very very small, I guess about 20 people max. It's great, because it gives you a nice familiar cozy atmosphere.If you have the money and wanna do yourself somethiing good. Come here."
4,"I had a great time here, the bartender knows his job. In the end he made me a Mojito with a Chocolate taste. That was Wonder full. When I'm back in Hamburg i will defintaly go back"
3,Great food and service. Not so great when it comes to location. But we go to restaurants for the food and not the location ;)
3,I had some of the best Calamari here that I have ever had.  The cocktails looked big and good. (A friend with me had a few of those).  I had two very large servings of that Bitte Hefe weissen which I really enjoyed.  The service was friendly and good.  They have a big board with the menu on it in German.  They will tell you what it is in English though if your German is not that good like mine. :)
3,"I was rather impressed with the bartender at this place. He was incredibly fast while giving each drink great attention and care. The waitresses working the tiny floor are also super-attentive and friendly, which is totally unexpected for a bar (or maybe I'm just overly accustomed to the I'm-too-hipster-for-you attitude of SF bars).Drinks were really good and reasonably priced. I'm not sure I agree with the current €€€ price attribute for this place. Having gone to IMARA across the street before coming here, drinks were way better priced at The Boilerman.Space is pretty tight. I imagine it's a bit better in the summer when they can make use of their front outdoor area. If you're standing in front of the bar, you'll have a constant flow of traffic from people going to the restroom. On the other hand, watching the bartender work is kind of mesmerizing.Smoking is allowed inside, so you'll walk out smelling like you slept in a tobacco factory. You may also shave off 5 years of your life. I'm hoping that eventually changes but people do love smoking here.On a Saturday night, it was packed and pretty loud. You'll definitely need to shout to be heard by anyone other than the person right next to you. Music isn't too loud, though, so that's a plus.Drink menu we got was entirely in English, which is a bit odd since a native German asked for them. The place was heavy on English speakers though, so they may just default to English menus when that happens.If you're in the area, definitely worth checking out."
4,Wow. Simply delicious food & really excellent service. I was a single diner here during a business trip in Hamburg and will make a special effort to return every time I'm in Hamburg!
3,"My wife and I haven't eaten at too many Italian restaurants in Hamburg since we first moved here, but enough to feel like pizza here just isn't very good. It seemed like most restaurants liked to reheat some version of a frozen pizza or just some other variety that just didn't taste authentic, or really very good for that matter.We were beginning to lose hope, thinking that we had to travel to Italy constantly to get good pizza (which obviously isn't a bad thing at all, especially since plane tickets aren't too bad from here). For the times we don't feel like leaving Hamburg but really want pizza, Grazie a Dio for Luigi's! It's the best tasting pizza we've tried, and the most authentic thus far in Hamburg.  All of the pizzas are very good (especially the pizza parma) and cooked in a large indoor wood-fired oven! I love that! Lunch menu portions, which are served around 12pm to 3pm Mon. - Fri. are just the right size per person at an awesome deal of 5€ per person with a small drink. Off-weekday-lunch hours the pizzas are almost double the price, but also probably 1.5 times the size...so there's that. My wife and I actually struggled to finish two pizzas on a lovely summer afternoon in Hamburg and had to box about a half of a pizza to take home. We will continue to try new pizza places throughout our new home, but we're glad to know that we have a really good place to come back to again and again."
4,By far the best Kebab I ever had. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. So is the service. The ideal place to spent afternoons with a good book and you diary. They also serve an excellent coffee.
4,"Great spot for dim sum in Hamburg! Tried lots of different dishes and enjoyed them all. Tasty and authentic Chinese food in the heart of Hamburg close to the Hauptbahnhof. Some of the food can take a while but it's worth the wait! FYI - They don't take reservations, so you just have to try your luck."
1,"It was not tasty.The menu on the card is nice, but the kumpir itself.. is small and less tasty. For this price you could find more tasty potatoes everywhere else.Compared with other Kumpir in Berlin or Istanbul, this is the worst.The salad and sauce was kind of interesting and it looked almost fresh. The shop itself looks clean."
4,Excellent food and service. Nice location with plenty of outside seating. Great jazz music and local beer on tap. Strongly recommend.
3,"Burgerlich had me licking my fingers. Good thing I came in with clean hands.The burgers here are very juicy and flavorful. And with the accoutrement of the housemade sauce, sundried tomato relish, melting cheese, and a pretty generous helping of mayo, you can expect it to get a little bit messy. Being that the burgers come on a tasty and light brioche bun, by default, you know that a brioche bun can't soak up the entirety of this meaty-juicy mess, so it's gonna get on you. The bathroom is upstairs when you're ready to clean up.The ordering system is pretty fun and novel. They've installed pop-up screens at every seat within the restaurant. Choose your burger and customize via a touchscreen. I didn't get too fancy with my cheeseburger, I just added some bacon on it. Side note: the onion rings here are awesome and I don't normally order or care for onion rings. Another really good hamburger in Hamburg that I've experienced as a new Hamburger."
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner here. My galette was stuffed with prosciutto, mushrooms and cheese - you really can't beat that! It was very tasty. My husband did not enjoy his galette because he mistakenly thought ""andouille"" was the New Orleans style spicy sausage. Let's just say this version had too many innards, not enough spice and a funky a metallic scent. He couldn't finish it, but I do not blame the restaurant since it was our ignorance.I recommend reservations or else you might not get a table. We did not have a reservation and they sat us, but advised our time would be limited until the reserved party arrived.Gluten free dining notes: 100% buckwheat crêpes are gluten free, and they will gladly substitute them for the wheat dessert options!"
4,"My boyfriend and I headed to this area without a reservation. We tried one other place with slightly higher reviews without luck. Choose this restaurant by chance, because it was close by and honestly, I am glad the first place turned us down because this restaurant was exactly what I wanted! They were able to seat us within 10 mins and even let me bring my small dog, as long as she stayed under the table (which she did the whole time, because my dog is perfect in every way). This place was packed but the service was extremely fast. The wait staff were running around nonstop to get everyone their food and drinks. It was the best service I've gotten since moving to Germany. The menu was in English and the wait staff were able to talk to us in English as well. They were very courteous.We ordered a bottle of the Vino Verde, 4 tapas (Spanish omellete, peppers, dates with bacon and mushrooms) and the mixed grilled seafood platter. It was our only meal of the day and still we had trouble finishing it and had to take some home. The tapa portions were generous and the fish platter was huge. I would order every single of these dishes again when I come back (and I will). The Vino Verde was great too. Everything was about 75 euros, which I think is more than reasonable. All in all, instantly one of my favourite places in Hamburg."
3,Really good food. Service was slow but other wise OK. The biggest downside was the lack of English menu.
3,This place is a lot smaller than expected but the food was so tasty. I recently converted to vegetarianism and needed to find a place that catered to such. I was craving Mexican food and this was the first place that popped up on my search. This is not a fast food place so don't expect to get your order within 5 minutes of ordering. There weren't any free tables so my bf and I sat at the bar sipping on our Fritz-Kolas as we waited ~25min for our food.I ordered the spinach quesadilla with 3 sides of salsa dip. It was so goodddd!!! I think it's enough to hold you over until dinner time.
3,"The food here is great. It's tasty (strong flavors), varied (so many options), fast, and inexpensive. I love coming here for a quick and casual lunch.It's worth explaining the system at Vin O Vin if you've never been, because it's a little complicated, but definitely worthwhile:1. Walk inside, and tell the nice lady behind the counter what you'd like to eat. If you're new, try the small pasta plate (which is quite big), and you can basically choose from 3-5 pasta options and about a dozen vegetable and side dish options in any combination. You can also order meat options (costs extra) like a piece of chicken or some meatballs. 2. The server will make up your plate as you choose things, and when you're done, she'll hand it to someone to be heated up. (This is the part that's a little awkward, because you might expect to just take the plate and start eating. But it's worth the wait.)3. Find a table to have a seat, or if it's crowded, one of the waiters will help you. There's some nice outdoor seating in the summer. One of the waiters will take your drink order once you've sat down, and will bring some bread for the table.4. A few minutes later, a waiter will deliver your food nice and hot for the eating. 5. Return to the far side of the counter to pay for your meal. Just tell them what you ate/drank, and they'll ring you up.Guten Apetit!"
3,"Wonderful place with many locals.One of best places at ""Schaze"". Meet youg and ""older"" generation. Weekends nights are getting very busy at this place.Perfect party spot.I had some GinTonic and enjoyed my time there.Service was OK."
3,"We tried the brand new American Brunch this past Sunday morning. Being an American I am usually fairly skeptical about anything advertised as ""American"". We arrived at 11 am and had our choice of tables inside or out. It was a breezy morning and we sat on the shady side of the house. (There isn't a sunny side this time of morning at the Chilehaus!) Cushions and blankets made the hard wood benches very comfortable. Our order was taken promptly by a friendly waiter and off we went to the buffet. I was quite happy to see pancakes and bacon as well as two types of eggs (scrambled and soft boiled). For the Brits there were sausages and beans, as well. The ""make your own"" waffles were a big hit with my kids and husband. The buffet also had the typical German breakfast items, such as Brötchen, assorted breads and toast bread, cheeses, meats, jams, jellies, cream cheeses, yogurts, etc. I also enjoyed the more lunch-y items: chili, wraps and steamed veggies. All of us finished our brunch off with a giant portion of fresh fruits. The food was good, well-prepared and quickly replenished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The brunch costs just under 15€ and includes a prosecco, a warm drink and an orange juice - quite a bargain, I think. My one and only suggestion would be to put out those mini glass bowls for the maple syrup. We will surely go back again!"
4,"Perfekt! Essen, Preis-Leistung, Ambiente  eine echte Bereicherung für Hoheluft."
4,"This was one of my favorite places while visiting Hamburg. Such a great welcoming vibe: old wooden tables, candles - cozy but not precious. The owner was extremely nice and they have an English menu too which was so nice after struggling to decipher German menus for weeks. I had the chicken burger which was incredible - full of flavor, topped with bacon and all the usual toppings. Highly recommend!  I enjoyed it with a Petit Chablis which I rarely see for sale in the US - definitely not a wine snob approved pairing but it hit the spot. If you're in the area definitely try this spot out!"
3,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a while back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have to like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Recently for example had the coconut milk and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
2,"this place deserves a lot of praise for the styles of the arts.the historical attributes of the arts are very impressive. in case you are it is your first time, it would nice to get in company with peoplehow know the place well. this will help you to explore a lot. the only thing that could make the place better is having staffs who really know what to look for with arts. in all this is a good place to spend time with visitors."
1,"Wir wollten gestern Hotdogs bei Miss Sofie essen  um 12:30 haben wir die Aussage bekommen, dass diese nicht vor 13 Uhr warm sein, wenn die Bedienung jetzt anfangen würde. Das Eis war die letzten Male sehr lecker (dafür die zwei Sterne)  aber bei einem von zwei Besuchen waren von den zwei vorhandenen Softeissorten (Schoko und Vanille) nur eine vorhanden :-(. Und teuer ist es auch noch. Grundsätzlich eine tolle Idee, aber irgendwie hapert es noch an der Umsetzung."
4,"The Speicherstadt, literally: 'City of Warehouses', meaning warehouse district) in Hamburg, is the largest warehouse district in the world where the buildings stand on timber-pile foundations, oak logs, in this particular case. It is located in the port of Hamburg--within the HafenCity quarter--and was built from 1883 to 1927.The district was built as a free zone to transfer goods without paying customs. As of 2009, both the district and the surrounding area are under redevelopment. As the first site in Hamburg, it was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site on 5 July 2015.The architecture is amazing and you can walk around and explore the buildings from the outside. It's a wonderful part of Hamburg and not to be missed. We walked around here for a long time and some nice cafes and things also in this area."
4,"I go to Jim Burrito at least once a month and I've never been disappointed with the food!Now that they reorganised the restaurant the service is even quicker. The decoration and the atmosphere are great, the music is cool (often rock).Huge pro: They have 3 menus- omnivorous- vegetarian- veganI recommend the quesadillas (served with guaca, sour cream, salsa and salad) or burritos if you are reeeeeaaally hungry"
4,Where does one hear the ships already better? Where does one see one more dog? Where does one see more Punks (there are it still) and infants on a heap? Where do the people wait so patiently and in a long line for their fried sausage? In the beach pearl! Directly at the beach of the Elbe stop of everything is possible. And n the winter: country under. Also beautifully!
4,"Visiting Hamburg for 6 days and we've decided to have dinner again at Xeom.Loved the food and service.Great food, atmosphere and a very fair price."
4,Had Bananenbrot and Vegetable Quiche with Salad yesterday. Both were so delicioussssss and of high quality. Veggies are so fresh. Quiche was just perfect. And Bananenbrot was just so yummy I had to eat in a row in 2 days. The restaurant is lovely and the staff are very nice. Highly recommended!
4,"Staff was friendly, explained all the items, and was a lot of fun to talk to. Everything we we tried was very good. Good music for the vibe too"
4,"OMG! I never thought I will have multiple orgasms in a museum (almost). For everybody whose heartbeat goes up from fast racing cars, it's a must see. Absolutely professional presentation, and even interesting for kids (but you have to watch them constantly so that they don't touch the cars). Toilets, nappy changing room are also top class. Otherwise quiet and relaxed atmosphere, you can take your time to explore the past and present of the fastest racing cars of the world."
4,"Great! I'm from California and this is my first time trying to eat Mexican food here. Not that it's so easy to find. I had the chorizo burrito and it's GIGANTIC! I just finished the rest of it for dinner. The chorizo is actually spicy, which surprised me, since it is Germany. haha. The people are really nice there. It's clean, not too expensive,but a little crowded at lunch. I will definitely go back and try all the other things. Es war toll! Ich komme aus Kalifornien und das war meine erste mal Mexicanessen zu probieren. Es ist ziemlich schwer zu finden. Ich habe den Chorizo Burrito bestellt und es ist RIESIG! Ich habe gerade die Reste für Abendessen gegessen. Die Chorizo ist scharf, es war eine Überraschung. haha. Die Leute sind sehr nett. Das Restaurant ist sauber, nicht so teuer, aber ein bisschen eng in die Mittagspause. Ich gehe gern zurück und wurde gern alle die andere Sachen probieren."
3,"La Sepia is located at the Sternschanze stop in Hamburg, which is filled with a bunch of hipster restaurants and boutiques. I liked the location cause La Sepia is right next to the Schanze's Sofa Bar (Zöe), so I can easily just walk on over after dinner to relax on a nice vintage sofa and enjoy some late night drinks. I had dinner on the night of a World Cup game so everyone was outside and all the restaurants were showing the game. It was really an event to see.The complimentary garlic dip at the beginning was okay, and a little bit on the saltier side, but when you're hungry and waiting on your food it doesn't necessarily matter. My boyfriend and I had the White Hauswein with our dinner. They brought our a bottle of it, and payment was calculated based on how much we actually drank, which I found to be liberating. I had the Paella Meeresfrüchte, which I definitely could've shared. The main problem with La Sepia is the wait and service. We waited for our food for over an hour and every time we asked about it, the server said he would go check on it and let us know, but he never came back. This happened about 3 times in one sitting. They would avoid us and it was just ridiculous. My boyfriend, who is a local, said that that was the norm of La Sepia. Make sure your BS tolerance is high the night you visit La Sepia. Otherwise, I would just come eat during lunch time to avoid the crowd."
3,"I had seen this place a couple times when at cafes or restaurants nearby but always passed as it was so full. This is obviously a good sign. We weren't disappointed. Came for breakfast on a Sunday and sat outside. Service is great and very attentive. The younger girl was super nice and the lady who was in the kitchen (and came out here and then to bring dishes) was also very pleasant. The food was great. We had a mix of breakfast options plus a piece of cheesecake at the tail end plus coffee and fresh mint teas. Everything was prepared with care and tasted really good. What I didn't like is that basically everything was reserved, even at an early hour and basically, a lot of tables sat empty for quite a while unused. Later on though, it was packed and I had noticed that some people would of have liked to take a seat but didn't as all tables were supposedly taken. One can't avoid this with such a small space but it could be managed a bit better in my opinion. Otherwise, we'll definitely be back (with a reservation) and will do our best to enjoy their front terrace area as when the weather is nice, this is the best option."
4,"Kartoffel Keller! I loved everything about this restaurant. At first glance, Kartoffel Keller looks like any other restaurant from the front. That is, until you realize that it's actually in the basement! Open the old door and be greeted with plenty of old world deco. They use waxy candles that melt over a wine bottle and by the look at the wax, they only use candle light. The ambiance is a bit dark but it's fitting. On to the food! I love potatoes. I love everything about potatoes and this restaurant specializes in potatoes! The translation of Kartoffel Keller is Potato Cellar. I went straight to the potato salads because I love German potatoes salads back home. There were types I have never seen nor heard of before so I went for the one that was that sounded the most unique. Potato salad with young herring, onions, beet root and apple slices. Everything in the salad was excellent. The sauce was a bit more watery then you'd find back home but it helped coat all the pieces nicely. The onions added a nice spicy bite. The potatoes were a little bitey which is exactly how I like them. I ordered the potato stew with sausage for the main course. It was very filling. It's served in a pot hanging over a tea light candle to keep it warm. The stew consistency was a little thin for what I would call stew, but the taste was there. There was some ground sausage in it with some cased sausage as well. Both were excellent. Since it was almost Christmas, I had to order the Gluhwein. It was very well done as well. The spices weren't over powering and it was just sweet enough to overcome the winey vapor you get from hot wine. Combine the ambiance with the food and the price, this place is a winner in my book. Next time I'm in Hamburg, you know where to find me. :)"
1,"Very nice location and the food is good (if they still serve it). Having said this, the service is just not able to keep up with the demand which shows the lack of concept: Only some service personal is allowed to take orders/payments whereas others only serve as ""food/drink carriers"". Thus, getting attention of one of the few ""higher ranked waiters"" to order or pay is just nearly impossible. Due to bad attention to the tables people stand in line right at the kitchen door to order or pay. This results in the other guests receiving even less attention. Furthermore, they stopped serving breakfast at 11am on a Sunday due to the kitchen not being able to keep up with the amount of orders. Final conclusion: Nice location but due to the incapable personal only recommended if you have a lot of time and a high level of frustration tolerance."
1,"Meh. The broth had little flavor, the noodles were over cooked, and too salty. I've had some great pho other places, maybe Hamburg you should stick to other things."
3,My boyfriend LOVES Liebling eis' ice cream. it's goodnot A LOOOT of choice but good enough.It's yummy but still not my favorite ice cream shop in hamburg!
3,"Finally, Turkish food that's not döner!We had to go to Ikea and instead of having Swedish meatballs like we always do when we go to Ikea, we decided to venture out a bit. With a little help from Yelp, we found Köz Urfa. I'm thinking I will find more occasions to go to Ikea now because of this delightful Turkish restaurant. This restaurant is HUGE! And there's a cave area for more intimate dining. We arrived a little after 5pm, so the place wasn't very full up. The various kebaps are neatly displayed in large refrigerated glass cases. The dining room was bright and clean, and the staff is super inviting and friendly.I ordered the Urfa kebap while the hubby ordered the Adana kebap. I believe the difference was his was spicy and mine was not. For 11€ per plate, you get a lot of food. The meat is laid on top of a half and half bulgar and rice. You also get like 5 different sides and some grilled veggies, as well as a side of flatbread. I was not able to finish my plate, but I guess next time I'll come hungrier.I'm very much looking forward to coming back. There are so many dishes to try, plus all the dessert!"
1,"They have a great happy hour deal: 3,50 for jumbo sized cocktails. But the food is disappointing. Not only is it grossly overpriced, but the quality doesn't even remotely justify it. We had to send back some buffalo wings that weren't cooked through. My burrito tasted like a wet sponge. My meal was bland and strange. Nothing had flavor except the salad dressing (which I regretfully discovered too late as a potential flavor enhancer). I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the Americas, from lavishly expensive to hole-in-the-wall family operations. Most all of them were splendid. Mexican food is actually very hard to screw up. But either I was mistaken and Sausalitos is not a Mexican restaurant, or like other Mexican restaurants in Germany it suffers the same curse German restaurants do in America: only still in business by virtue of their novelty. Service:People skills were sorely lacking. I got my coffee with a creamer that turned out to be empty; it had been reclosed, likely by the patron who whitened his or coffee with it earlier that day. The server was in no way apologetic or surprised by that. It also tells me something about what the restaurant does to save money when clearing tables: scavenging peoples dishes for reusable items. Disgusting!!! I won't eat there again. But I might go for cocktails (though to be honest, they weren't very good either.)"
4,"Hundreds of positive reviews, so you know this place is fantastic. It is a reason (for me) to come to Germany in the first place. Some advice:-Email in advance for a tour. It is reasonably priced, they can assign you an English speaking guide, and you get to go behind the scenes. You can see underneath the airport, hidden charging areas, a shocking amount of infrastructure underneath the models, and a whole lot of explicit scenes that can only really be seen from behind!-Push the buttons to watch stuff happen. There is a chocolate factory action button. The chocolate is just OK but it's still fun.-The food in the cafe is decent, and is kitschy as hell but fun.-If you're here on a weekend, put your bulky stuff in the lockers as it can be crowded up top-Budget a few hours to be here."
3,"The Kopiba is also known as ""Deathpresso"" Café.  It's their home brand coffee bean and is alsoactually the big sign outside above their entrance... so don't be confused when ppl tell you they'll meet you at ""Deathpresso""This leads us to the next fact: Kopiba is all about coffee and Espresso and they have an excellent selection of self-roasted coffees to have there and to buy. The staff is always willing to help you select the espresso bean that you want.It's a small café but intimate and cozy. On weekends they serve a breakfast buffet which contains just anything that you will need after your long night out in St Pauli.DO TRY their waffles!!!! They are absolutely amazing!!!"
2,this parlour is open all year round.strawberry ice-cream is recommended.don't go to tiramisu.
4,I haven't found a better place to eat good fish in Hamburg yet. The place is really busy but it is definetly worth waiting for a table. Try the Taschenkrebs 'natural' and the Jakobsmuschel-Spiesse!
3,"I've come to Burgerlich several times now with coworkers, family and friends. Generally, it's a good experience. There have been a few times where it wasn't so great, i.e. bathrooms not being kept clean, toilet paper strewn about in the upstairs hall and undercooked meatballs served to my child. Although, upon letting someone know, it was quickly taken care of.The ability to order via the tablet apps makes for a speedy food delivery to your table. I love the chili burger but I find that the meals are quite pricey in comparison to other burger locations nearby. Envious of the recipe for the chili mayo, it's so delicious!!!Highly recommend trying the homemade drinks. My personal go-to is the Basilikum Lemonade."
4,"First bar I went to in Hamburg and don't need to go anywhere else. It's amazing. I did my washing, drank weird Germen shots and was so drunk I had to be escorted home."
3,"To be totally honest i don't come here to eat. I come for the beer!For the huge (1L) mass beer!And their pretzels! Lovely 'Oktoberfest themed' pub.I've been there only by night. on the week ends its always packed. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in a typical bavarian costums.There's also live music, typical german folkoric music, that i as a non-german dont know, but still dance to! It's a great place, especially if you're out of town or you have visitors."
3,"Chouette endroit en effet, la rue est jolie, une clientèle brassée et ma foi sympathique, service gentil, bons cocktails quand le barman est là et bonne surprise chaque fois : les prix sont très modérés. Mon chouchou : les pizzas sont excellentes, vous savez, celles avec des ingrédients frais et à pate fine. C'est simple, je ne mange jamais de pizza en dehors de chez moi, exception faite pour Gloria. Ce soir sur la carte, une pizza chèvre miel et poire, un délice! Sinon la Rucola Parma Schinken, très bonne aussi. Tables en terrasse toujours bondées à partir de 15 degrés ;-) c'est typique de Hambourg! De toutes façons, on est mieux assis à l'intérieur."
3,"We went here on a busy hot sunny day last week. We would have walked right past it, but my 8 year old daughter saw it and was capitivated. So we paid for a family ticket expecting to just walk up and down the deck, go to the loo then get off. How wrong! The ship is brimming with interesting things about itself, the original merchants who commissioned her, how the crew lived, lots of artefacts plus all the lower decks and cabins left how they would have been in days gone by. There is also a nice looking restaurant deep in the heart of the ship. We really enjoyed our 90 minutes on there and regard it as one of the highlights of my family's week in Hamburg"
4,"This place is an oasis of human interaction and peace. I really loved it! It was one of the most or I could say most heartwarming experiences visiting a place can offer. You get to know not only how it is - to see nothing and spend time in dark - but whats more important is that you learn to trust the person guiding you, not even seeing them. Just buy touch. When it ended I wished that peace and trust could last longer. Have to apply well in advance to get a tour, but it is so worth it. Also don't forget to put a few Euros in pocket(have to leave stuff in locker) to get to buy some drink, I had chocolate milk, and it tasted amazing! Great experience, would go again!"
4,Nice and tasty cakes. They also offer vegan ice-creams which are really good! Cappuccino are nice as well. The place in Sternchanze is really cozy and you will feel comfortable and welcomed.
3,"This is the first time I have been in this restaurant,it is a Very nice persian enviromental restaurant,very good varities of meal and services with reasonable prices.sertainly I would recommend this restaurant to eat in."
1,Poor service and quite late served. The meet was average but they have a good wine selection. The plates were moving while I was trying the cut the meet because there is not tablecloth at all. I didnt like the atmosphere and the combination with low and high tables. Except for the wine I don't see any reason for coming back.
4,"You fancy a steak but also a burger and can't decide which one you want for dinner? Well there you have it: Grinded premium steak meat between two buns -Bombdelicious my friends! And all of that between 9 and 13 bucks. It's the first time i had a burger with dripping blue cheese sauce - tasty! I'm just amazed by the variety of special stuff those burgers come with...one of us had the ""Drunk Ghetto"" with a shot of Vodka (cheers). For all the ""healthy"" ones of us...you can either choose a side of fries OR spinach or ceasar salad. They don't say it specifically on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Oh and for the really tough folks out there, try the Chicken Wings Napalm. But be brave, as it is already saying on the menu ""crazy hot""... it will clear your head in a second and gave my friends, quote ""hallucinations"". I was being a chicken and only had a bite....still needed water though which the waitress already had in stock for us since she saw us puffing.The waitresses were in general very alert.So 5 stars are flying to the bird!"
2,Great space; pieces are great including the two Lagerfeld dresses when you enter the museum.  I found an elevator but I don't think it was listed on the map.Restaurant wasn't too bad and the price was great.  The museum store is pretty much what you'd find in any other museum.
4,"I'm a massive fan of the Stadtpark, and now summer is just around the corner, I'm inspired to tell you why. For a decent program, I'd highly recommend renting a canoe and paddling your way through the canal network into the Stadtparksee, where you can promptly jump in (without paying!) and swim to shore. Then unload your picnic, beers and size 6 cricket set, and a happy afternoon will be had by all. It's advisable to use a windball instead of the real thing, lest you kill a baby and put a dampener on everything."
4,This place was humming on a Wednesday night. Luckily we had made reservations. Parking in the area was a nightmare. Better use public transportation. But it was worse it. We did had to wait some time to get the attention of the waiter. Staff was nice and courteous. Will definitely come again.
4,"Think of Mc Donalds or Burger King and then think better quality. JB's is a fantastic burger bar in Barmbek. It's a bit of a walk from U S Barmbek and situated underneath Block House.JB's and Block House are tied together business wise or were. Someone told me about that but I forget the full story.The burgers are a big sized and packed full of tasty stuff ranging from fried mushrooms, bacon, cheese. All with a good dash of salad. Plus frieds or garlic bread on the side.Insider tip: Try the garlic bread!! It's the same as Block House. So incredibly tasty!The restaurant is nicely sized with kids area. It's also well kept and maintained. Staff service is also pretty good. But expect a queue around 6pm when everyone decides they can't be bothered to cook."
0,Qrito would have been an even better if they didn't charge people a euro for ten grams of jalapeños! A pretty bad experience don't think I'll go back again. But go on I am sure the burritos won't give you much more than gas.
4,"This place is a find! Mirco Gattardo and his wife Anja greet you and display their menu on a big chalkboard brought to your table. Creative cooking, fine service, reasonable prices. Wines from Salice, in southwest Italy. We loved Trattoria Salento so much we went there three nights in a row! Highly recommend."
3,"Greatest bun bo hue! Beefy broth with a little kick to it, but not too much. Comes with bean sprouts on the side. Yummy! If I lived here, this would be the place to get my fix. Skip the prawn spring rolls though, pretty boring and flavorless. Tra da tea good but a little pricy."
4,A museum totally dedicated to chocolate! The guided tour was excellent and we sampled lots of chocolate along the way. Definitely recommend visiting when in Hamburg.
4,My two kids loved the joy of ordering on a tablet and swiping the meal themselves! Good food and good atmosphere. Will be back this week.
4,"I know it is going to sound strange to read this, but I gotta let it out. How niiiice the people here are. My best friend wanted to book a table yesterday and one of the staff members from the kitchen just showed us a piece of paper which basically said: Please take NO more bookings for tonight! He smiled at us and showed it to us, but asked us to leave our number just in case there might be an open spot later. My friend received a call, called back and this friendly woman just said: Hello Alex! Yeah..now you are surprised, right?! And he was. Unfortunately they didin't have a free table for the time he wanted, but he said being declined with such a nice explanation will make him come back pretty soon and this time he will book days in advanced. This seems to be the new/old hidden hot spot in the hood.I am exited to get to know it and then write another feedback."
3,"Rather interesting town hall area - large and fairly impressive. To any tourists, it is not a place you need to plan into your trip, as I found I inadvertently passed through the area several times whilst crisscrossing the city trying to see different sights. Not saying the town hall is not worth a stop, the architecture is worth a picture moment in its own rights (and I am not a buff in that area, to me, it looks nice), but given the location, it is easily reachable from different ends of the city. Visited during Spring, so the area was pretty lively and picturesque. Would definitely be on my list of interesting places in Hamburg."
3,"Katze is a cool new bar on the Schulterblatt. As you might guess from the name is a little bit cat-themed, but not much, because that would probably be rubbish. At the time of writing (6 November '08) this bar is so new that it still smells of wet varnish and paint, and the outside of the bar looks unfinished - there's no name for example. The bar staff are mostly young, attractive and blonde. The punters seem to be of a similar ilk, but maybe not quite as blonde. There are free bar snacks on every table, but they don't serve any hefeweizen. However they make up for this small oversight by serving Augustiner brau. It'll be interesting to see how this one develops, but things are looking good at the moment."
2,"Ended up here to watch the world cup one evening and it was quite an interesting experienceto my left, a couple with a baby, on my right, a rawkus of Korean businessmen going at it like the world is ending on a bottle of something-or-other and their table grills. Every 5 minutes SLAM! and they all did a group shot.In the middle, myself and friends watching the game (and the businessmen) commenting on the fantastic English translations on their menu. I honestly can't remember what I ate, don't really like Korean food, but it was a good time and definitely memorable."
0,The Dim sum was ok but the main dish Sweet and Sour was terrible . Cheap low quality chicken. The sauce was not made with love either and for 11.90 a real joke
4,Best curry cuisine ever. I'm from London by the way. I became a regular customer now.
3,"After having Dulf's Burgers recommended to me last week by a Friend, to whom it was recommended by many others, we had to check it out ourselves. The Place was so full, it was hard to get a place, but that only matched what we had been told. The best thing about the food is, that most, if not all, ingredients are sourced locally. But local food is nothing without any taste. Luckily, Dulf's Burgers are awesome! You can literally taste the attention to detail that goes into every Burger. And the prices are fair as well. I will definitely return when I am back in Hamburg again."
3,"Danmark Snack is basically just hotdogs and burgers, but mostly hotdogs. It's a very unassuming little place, and so for the past year I'd always just walked on by to one of the other fast-food places. I had noticed that it's well reviewed here by German Qypers, and so when leaving the Reeperbahn S-Bahn hungry last night I popped in. The place is basically a hotdog factory, but they also have a few burgers if you want one of those. I went for a cheeseburger and it hit the spot. Not too big, not too small. it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was better than most of what is on offer at other nearby establishments."
2,"Ok. We came here mainly because both me and my wife's most favorite comic book character of all time is Batman. Yes, I know it is a city in Turkey, but we still had to try the doner kebab here because of the name...if not for all of the glowing reviews as well. If anything, the food here is a fantastic deal. It's seriously lunch and dinner for about €4. Many places only offer doner kebab stuffed in pita, but here they are well known for the durum doner which are served with delicious freshly made flatbread (it's really good!).The meat, however, we both felt was lacking in flavor and that is a pretty big component in the doner kebab itself. I know we will be back, but only after we've sampled around some."
4,"I haven't been here in a while (as I don't work in the area any longer) but I LOVED this place! GREAT food, nice service, good value and when the weather is nice you can sit outside. I must get back there.Delicious!"
4,This is one of very few specialist coffee shops in Hamburg and they do a perfect job.... Their 'First Love' espresso is prob the best origin blend espresso I've tasted
4,"Der beste Grieche in ganz Hamburg.Wer hier nicht bei Top-Essen satt wird,ist selber Schuld!"
4,"I am a long time customer of Panthera Rodizio in Hamburg, I usually go every time I am in Germany.The food is fantastic! When ordering, simply ask for Rodizio and skip the Salad bar  you don't have to have the salad unless you want it.I admit the service is slow at times, but having 20 or so staff serving a 300 cover restaurant thats packed and new customers arriving as soon as the ones that have finished, I feel the service is good.The atmosphere is very alive and noisey, which is to be expected. As someone else said, Alsterwasser is like a Shandy, beer watered down with lemonade. There are 2 P.R. in Hamburg. The one in H.H. (Hamburg Harburg) is a bit smaller and the service there is terrible, the main P.R. is near the docks in Hamburg (Hamburg Harfen). They also have one in Bremen, but I don't like this one so much, it's in the railway station (bahnhof)."
4,The restaurant has the original Vietnamese ambient very nice. The food is authentic. Will be back for sure
4,"We ordered chili cheese fries for appetizer off the board. I had The Jack, it was delicious. The meat was cooked at perfect temperature and they put a pretty good amount of cheese. I was afraid the blue cheese would be too strong but it wasn't. I added an egg on my burger for the hell of it. The bread they use are English muffin which is a nice change."
4,I saw this place on yelp. The staff spoke English too!!I was welcomed by the owner and was treated very well.Your journey starts with feta cheese accompanied with herbs. The feta cheese was very very fresh and good!!I ordered a lamb sultani and it was amazing. The steak was luscious and so was the koubideh. Also their yogurt drink was pretty authentic and worth a try!!Do try this place if you like Persian food.
4,After a truly grueling day we came here as a group of 8. Everyone left with content smiles. Perfect wait staff and excellent food. Love this place!!!!
4,"Great food , don't mind the waiters they might be pushy but at the end they are dealing with a language barrier, other than that even the price was great"
4,"Great food, large portions, reasonable prices and a quaint old world setting make Thämers the go-to restaurant in this area.What I like the most is the ambiance. It is dark and rustic. Whether with a group of friends or alone with a book, it is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. There isn't a great deal of sitting space inside, so if you are coming at prime time it is a gamble if they will be able to seat you.Favorite dishes here were the pan fish and the pork chop. Both come with a side of fried potatoes, which are very tasty. Potions on all the dishes were hearty.The staff is welcoming, and with a drink the average price is somewhere around €15 for dinner."
1,"No vegan or vegetarian food (even in the veggie ramen has fish inside), the edamame was less salty than it should be. My partner wasn't blown away with his noodles either.  Don't get me wrong it is a good place to be if you eat meat and like ramen. However, don't waste your time as vegetarian or vegan there."
3,"Was very pleasantly surprised by this place. A friend invited me here for lunch having eaten here before. I was expecting bland kiosk style food. It turned out to be really good and the portions are solid. They have a ""Mittagskarte"" which makes everything affordable if you come during the day. I've not yet eaten dinner here but I presume it fills up fast. Service is always polite...have now been here a couple times and food tends to come out fairly quickly. It's also nice to sit outside if the weather allows for it but there aren't that many tables...as is the case with most places on the Lange Reihe."
4,"Long live Sommersalon! My friends and I love this place. The music is a great mix of funk, hip hop and R&B - old and new school. The DJ's will stir up some James Brown with Kanye and throw in some Rolling Stones too. It's a really cool vibe. No fancy drinks, but who needs them? And absolutely no mind-numbing, repetitive techno beats. It's never our first stop, but we always end the night there. The dance floor is jumping after 1am. The place itself isn't so pretty, and it gets really crowded but you'll have a good time. Ladies - take tissues. They are always out of toilet paper."
3,It's a really nice bar with happy hours to some coctails. And they have also nice coffee and few cakes which I didn't try. You could sit outside.
3,"High quality, delicious meat and sides. I ordered the rinderbraten oder (salted beef) with gravy, red cabbage, and krout. Each plate (you can choose large or normal sized) come with two sides. The choices are side salad, mashed or diced potatoes, red cabbage, and krout.The red cabbage and krout were sweeter than most I've tried. I particularly enjoyed the krout and was told it's both ""sour and sweet"" krout. There are also three types of mustard: süß (meaning sweet, seemed like a honey mustard), and scharf (meaning sharp, very strong) and mittel-scharf (meaning medium-sharp, still very strong)."
3,"I was coming here quite regularly 3-4 years ago but gave up because only one big problem and that is the glutomat chemical which they put in almost everything to improve the taste. I came again to see whether something changed but I'm afraid not much. It's really pity because the place is really good, and most of food and specially dim sums are delicious. Staff should be more polite but this is usual problem when place is very busy, they dont have time for nicer approach. I wasn't sure wether to give 3 or 4 stars because glutomat is serious problem but in the end I gave the streched 4 star because delicious stem breads just landed on my table :-)"
4,"This place is fabulous! I have been there a few times after playing sports or with a group of co-workers. Service is attentive, not fake, funny, knowledgeable. Atmosphere is Greek at heart, sometimes there are Greeks from the neighbourhood gathering and singing. Food is delicious, portions are big, but not too big. The appetisers like octopus or sardines were not drowned in oil, but just delicious. We usually order other appetisers, too and mix food and drinks....  Drinks: I always have a retsina wine, which reminds me of Greece. Happy customer"
4,Great burgers for a really fair price. Funny and welcoming service. Definitely worth checking out! Jan bester man!!
2,"Food was good, but there are literally wasps in the food containers.  Not sure if this will affect people with allergies, but the wasps are literally crawling on the food, and it seems that the staff doesn't care.  That's what I interpreted it as at least."
4,"The food was outstanding as was the setting and ambiance. However, sadly one member of staff was very rude - we had asked what the people next to us were having and then went onto order two separate dishes. We were then given three dishes and when we said we did not order the waffle, we just  asked what it was she was extremely rude - this continued when we paid the bill. This was a tad disappointing after a fabulous brunch."
4,"I came all the way from Houston Texas, which has a very large Vietnamese population, to taste some of the best Pho I have ever had. I recommend the Pho with chicken and meatballs. If noodle soup is not your thing then try the Vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken. I actually started an account on Qype because of this place! Lecker Lecker!"
4,"Always my first choice when going out to eat in Hamburg, friendly atmosphere and delicious food. Try the Lamb rack it's always my first choice, but the other dishes are also delicious. And of course the Mezze as to start of the meal. The price point is also more than fair with this quality of food."
4,I was there by accident. A friend was just showing me around in his neighbourhood. We were having a cheap but excellent coffee there. .....Mister Lars Herden was just roasting some coffee beans and started to explain the manufacturing process to us...He took quite some time to make us understand the difference between normal industrial coffee and his excellent product...I will definitely come back. Love this authentic wonderful place ;)
3,"Yes it's true: it's a beach club in the middle of town. Complete with sand, chairs, ping pong and more (but no volleyball, sigh...)Yelp turned me in to this and because I needed a chill vibe and uncomplicated food st reasonable prices I came here. No Chardonnay but I made do with a Pinot Grigio. The next stand over o ordered the Curry Wurst and Pommes with Mayo. Nice large portion of all and the Curry Wurst was tasty but I'm not used to the sweet-sour glaze it swam in. One drawback...no cards. Cash only and you don't know that before you order. I guess I really should get used to asking that ahead of time because I keep running into that. But there are places you just expect to be able to use a card and a restaurant is just one of those. I can see how this place would be packed on a summer afternoon or weekend. Too fun!"
4,"Pauli pizza is like an institution in St. Pauli. You get to be creative and do your own pizza.The small basic pizza cost 2EUR50 and the big one 3EUR50.However small is really small, and big is medium size (pizza hut standards) Toppings are between 50c and 1EUR50. Great tasting pizza, that's why it's always busy. So maybe you should pre-order your pizza on the phone then pick it up after 15 minutes, instead of waiting in the really small place, which gets full very quickly!"
4,"Great food, fast and friendly service, and good prices.I had some lamb chops here and they were absolutely spectacular! The lamb was very tender and full of taste. The rice was well-flavoured. The salad was made with a great variety of ingredients and was very zesty. The overall combination of flavours was well-selected and the layout of the food was really colourful.Although the outdoor seating has a very 'fast-food BBQ' sort of feel to it, the indoor seating looks much more like a restaurant. The décor is colourful and lively, and the place does have a rather 'busy' feel to it.I'd recommend stopping by here if you're in the neighbourhood."
2,"We finally tried Jim Block after a year of living in Hamburg. The verdict? As the 3 stars indicate, it was ok--nothing more or less than what I expected I guess. Jim Block burgers are slightly better than McDonalds or Burger King in flavor, but are double in price. The bread used is that familiar super soft, highly processed looking bun that, frankly, isn't made to hold much in between them. This makes JB burgers a fork and knife kind of a meal. The burger patty looks mass-produced, was dry and highly seasoned, probably because of the lack of flavor in the actual meat. The fries tasted very much like McDonalds fries. Ketchup and mayo are 40 cents each and instead of serving the burger in a wrapper, it comes on a plate. I ordered the JB Champignon while my hubby ordered the JB BBQ. Both had good combinations of ingredients, but no matter what you put in it, you can hide that subpar meat. In conclusion, I can see the appeal, but I won't be coming back, at least not on my own volition."
3,"Ah Rosi's Bar.. it's another of the almost identical bars on that side of Hamburger Berg. That mean's it's actually a pretty good bar, but you could just as easily pick any of 5-10 bars within 50 yards and have the same evening. - popular music? check.- dance floor? check.- cheap(ish) drinks? check.- good crowd? check.- free entry? check.- table football? check. Did I just copy/paste that review? Did someone copy/paste this bar?"
3,"A delightful restaurant.  We came here looking for a place to have a casual meal and drink whilst not being harrassed to keep buying more refreshments and could sit and chat without feeling like it was time to leave.There is the ground level restaurant which is rather snug the only table left was next to the toilet so we didn't fancy that (there is a reason no one sat there).  We were then told that downstairs has more space.  To get downstairs you come out of the restaurant and down the stairs from street level.  A cosy 'tavern' type place with plenty of space.  The waitress was happy and they were able to provide me with a English menu (yeah, I know..).  Food was simple but looked tasty and very reasonably priced I felt.  We opted for the recommended burger with fried potatoes (not chips as we know it).  Burger came and was huge with a nice bowl of friend potatoes.  The burger was delicious and can see why it was recommended. I didn't think I was very hungry but managed to eat every last morsel of food.We were able to stay there for hours without being harrassed.  Waitress was friendly and service was prompt I have not complaints about this place and it was a very reasonable price.  2 good size chicken burgers with all the trimmings and fried potatoes along with a few alcoholic drinks and 2 hot chocolates all for €31.00.  After that meal I was still feeling full and skipped breakfast the next morning!My only negative is that they do not take credit card payments and only cash.  Wise thing to know before going there."
3,A bit of Berlin hipster style but I like it a lot. It's a good choice for brunch or a small lunch if you follow a vegetarian diet. Delicious coffee and what's more attractive is their awesome homemade cookies!
4,"We had a really nice dinner here during a quick trip to Hamburg.I like to start a steakhouse dinner with a classic cocktail (manhattan for me, martini for my date).  This place had a very good bartender on duty that evening.  The chopped salad needed to be a bit more 'chopped,' and it had a bit too much dressing but overall wasn't bad.  The meat was great.  I had Argentinian, because I prefer grass-fed beef, and my date had American.  Both were *perfectly* seasoned and perfectly cooked.  We would have liked to try the European beef (which is dry-aged), but the smallest cut was 900g or so?  seemed much too big.  The waiter explained the reason why the cuts were so big, but we couldn't completely understand.The wine list was extremely expensive, comparatively speaking, but seemed well chosen.  Service was very professional.  Beef:  it's a nice break from Hamburg Pann-fisch!"
2,"Not really for my taste, i think it was a bit overpriced for what we got. Ambient was nothing special. The staff was actually very nice and friendly"
3,"When I see people eating from the ""to go"" cartons it makes it look so damn good."
3,"Super casual atmosphere and reasonable prices. I had seen the pictures of the ""Lumper Jack"" burger and just had to try it. The level of service was in top (and in English!) however, they forgot the jalapenos in my burger even tho i asked for it. The food came very soon after I'd ordered.The bun was soft and very sweet - just as it should be. The burger had soft onions, double patties with double cheese and bbq sauce. Great combo. Very tasty burger and it tasted  homemade for each bite. The fries had peel on them which is delicious but I doubt they were homemade. The dippings were def. non-homemade. If the fries had been homemade roughly cut steak fries with homemade mayo we could have achieved the last star.Overall still a great experience and I'll surely come back if I have the chance."
3,This restaurant/bar is right at the end of the Reeperbahn. Its large and had some interesting interior decorations. Definitely worth looking into it.The food was yummy and the beer was tasty. Thats what we needed after a long walk through hamburg. Thanks guys.
3,"This is a great place in Hamburg to sit and eat with friends. It's pretty packed, but if you hang around it long enough, you can get a place to sit.  I'd say this place is more north Vietnamese than southern, which means the dishes are presented and named differently, but it's so slight most people won't even notice/care. The pho here is different than most other Vietnamese restaurants: you don't get a side dish of bean sprouts, lime, chilis and herbs to add to you soup.This isn't a downside in my opinion, because the soup gets there fast and is beautifully satisfying.Since all the pho is 6.50 (a freaking steal if you ask me), I got pho tôm, which was pretty damn good. My friends all had Bún (pork, beef & tofu). I tried the tofu bún and it was truly amazing. I will probably get it the next time I'm here. The drinks were all good, both the lemonades and the red sake mojito are freshly made.All in all (tl;dr), it's a nice casual place to go and sit with friends and eat, drink & talk. I'm sure it's even nicer in the summer months with outdoor seating and slower tempo. The only downside was the waitress, she was a bit curt and heavy-handed, but I'm sure she'd had a long day. In the end we didn't mind it because the food was good and the service was fast."
4,When in Hamburg- must try this Italian gem ;) the creamy pasta with truffles is the most delicious dish I've had! You can share small dinner portion with the veal fillet ... OUT OF THIS WORLD. The waiters are all very nice and helpful- Bon App!
3,"Went here recently as one of my colleagues recommended it. Everything was tasty and seemed fresh. The place was packed at lunch so many other people also seem to think the place is good. It's fairly tight seating-wise but again, if a lot of people are here, things are being prepared fresh and it's a good sign in my eyes. There is an extensive menu and the pricing is definitely fair for the area. There is also seating out front if the weather plays along. I wouldn't call this place a ""destination"" but surely a good choice if in the area."
3,"The best place for a hamburger in Hamburg.Always busy mainly because of the location on Jungfernsteig but also down to the speed, service and quality of what's on offer.Great value, cheaper and a lot nicer than a McDonalds!As a tip on the best time to come i would suggest Sundays as you can get served within a few minutes and eadily find somewhere to sit."
4,"Klasse Laden, nette Leute! Toller Treffpunkt fuer allerlei Oldtimerfans"
4,Very good Mexican cuisine. Portions are large and the food is authentic! Definitely recommend it.
4,"Did anyone say ""Hamburgs best pizza""?? They might have said that. I wouldn't know if they were right, cause this is the only Pizza place I'be been to in Hamburg. But one thing Im sure of: They make damn fine pizza at Pizza Bande!Its a very nice place, made me want to linger for longer, just to take in the atmosphere. But loads of people want to eat here - so we ate, and left. Judging by the number of people outside, waiting for a place to sit, I'd say that the Hamburg people love this place to. So it might just be the best damn pizza they have. I kinda even wish I could have one now ... mmmm. And one tip: Go for their specials, you might think the combinations are odd. But they are good!"
1,"Location, location, location. The view is fantastic - that's it. The drinks are mediocre but pricey, the staff is disinterested and poorly trained. Service is slow and needs to be hunted down. After two hours precisely, we were just about to order another round, he hostess came to our table with the next guests in tow, telling us she needed the table now - no reminder or warning, no alternative offered. There are more bars with better quality drinks and better service in town. Not going back to this one."
3,"Nice coffee shop, really small place though. Dark, wood-heavy interior, friendly staff. homemade pastries, lunch menu. 1 hour free wifi via tMobile hotspot, charge your batteries, people, outlet costs .50 per hour extra! Cardamom & nutmeg shakers - you fancy, huh?"
4,One of my favorite cafes in the neighborhood. Dog friendly and gorgeous interior decoration and super friendly owners.
4,a great taste of home with american style breakfast complete with excellent veggie sausage. good pancakes too!
4,The Strandperle is for lots of people living in Hamburg a kind of a famous café. They are right. It is really beautiful.It is directly situated at the Elbe and visitors have really a great view at this river. You may watch the huge ships passing by while you are having a coffee or you are enjoying your breakfast.A small beach is directly in front of the caféThe café is very special and you will find lots of young people spending their time here. Lots of people in the twenties and thirties go there to meet friends or to relax.The atmosphere is amazing. When you go there simply to have coffee and to relax it often may happen that people start a conversation without knowing you at all. This is the result of such a comfortable atmosphere. Everybody is relaxed and life is beautiful again.The service is very friendly and professional.It is really worth going there and enjoy this place.
1,"Cute little cafe unfortunately the service is slow and not quite attentive. The coffee is good but the food could be better, the eggs had not been properly boiled, cheese came with a bit of plastic still attached to it and the bread they serve for a large breakfast plate for two persons is only two tiny slices and two really small knäckebröd wedges. We basically had to ask for extra bread so we could finish the plate and we were asked exactly how many slices we'd require. I should also mention where we sat (at the back of the place) a few spiderwebs were hanging from the ceiling and that's simply not nice."
2,"A rock bar right out of St.Pauli station in Hamburg.On our way to start a long night out we decided to have our first beer in here - this is kind of a weird bar.. Why? Because the atmosphere is good, but something is still not working.The bar is rather narrow, when we were there it was pretty full but we were lucky to get a table.Anyhow, seems like it's a 30+ bar, maybe even 40+, I felt like I don't belong. There was a band playing live music which was pretty cool, but when they were on a break the music became weird, I wouldn't expect some of the songs they played (Phil Collins at a rock bar? Really?!)The menu is pretty awesome, I wasn't hungry and it still made me curious, lots of offers - from chili con carne and small appetizers to sandwiches and burgers. They also sell my favorite drink at the moment - açai energy drink, yum yumIt wouldn't be my first choice when going out, but it was ok."
4,"This is not your typical Turkish German restaurant or donair place (although they do serve a great variety of donairs): great quality food, very friendly staff who visibly care about the food they cook fresh, nice seating both in- and outdoors - and all this for a very reasonable price. Impressed."
3,"Really nice and cozy pub in the center of Hamburg. I enjoyed here a dinner after a soccer match...and it was kind of ""rejuvenating"". Nice beers and nice burgers.I took the Eva's: chicken breast, bacon and salad with fried potatoes. Really nice, good size and just 8€. Everything well cooked and the overall taste was well balanced.I really loved the internals, wooden table and chairs, rhe candles and the dark atmosphere!"
4,"Hello Friends, welcome welcome welcome! The place looks lovely, the handmade tables are gorgeous and so is the bar. Nice job. It's sparse of course, but you'll grow into that gigantic space soon enough. It takes time...til then: The food is really good. I love that I can have a burger medium instead of charred like back home (it's ground STEAK), I love that the emphasis is on the meat and not the bread. I love that there's a roll of paper towels right on the table for me to wrap myself in so I don't get covered in food. I love that a real someone cut each and every fry on my plate. I love love love the pickles that bossman makes himself. FINALLY DECENT PICKLES! I love a ton of ice in my cola, and big German beer.Even the NY cheesecake is alright ;) I'm so glad you're here! I am just down the street if you ever need anything, cup of sugar, directions etc..."
4,"Awesome bar! The food is very nice and very affordable. The space is a little crammed, but it adds to the charm and the staff (and indeed he patrons) were very nice nice"
2,"Es ist ok, overall. I'm from California and have consumed countless burritos in the States...from the States that really matter when it comes to Mexican cuisine. (I've also been to Mexico a few times.)How does the food here compare? It's not too bad...really. The flavors were ok...maybe just lacking that delicious and dirty pig-fat flavoring from the grill. I enjoyed the burrito much more than the ""enchilada"" as the burrito was prepared much more like how they should be.Service was very friendly and the decor and atmosphere actually felt very SoCal-ish...think La Lucha Libre in SD, but less pink and gaudy and more punk."
4,"It's nice to see that these formally vacant wharehouses and been modernised and used as offices, studios and small businesses. Speicherstadt houses Hamburg Dungeons and the impressive indoor model railway. A short walk from Landungsbrucken or a bus ride from the city centre."
4,The restaurant has more than just Vietnamese food. We had tasty Thai style curry dishes - a welcome break from wurst. Prices are good and the waiter is attentive.
4,"Seemingly run by a husband-wife combo, this is a really nice little Italian place for lunch. It's a bit imbissy with its high, small tables, but the food is great and a reasonable price. I had a Diavolo pizza and it was the best pizza that I've had in a long time. I'll be back"
3,"Stopped off for brunch on Saturday. My wife and I showed up around noon and found only a few seats available. Reservations seem really popular for breakfast here; I would definitely call ahead! Brunch runs from 8AM - 2PM and focuses on the classics: meat, cheese, eggs, eggs with bacon bits, OJ, and salad. I think it was just the right amount of food and selection for 8 Euro.Drinks, coffee and alcohol are available at the front counter. Everything seems to be self serve and pay afterwards. It's a pretty chill atmosphere, maybe a bit loud though when all the rooms are full. I'll probably be heading back."
0,"We made a reservation for 6 people at 6pm. We arrived and from the beginning, the female server had a major attitude. Everything we said she had to roll her eyes at us and shrug her shoulders. In fact, one of the people in our party asked for a dark beer and she replied: ""I don't know."" Again, my colleague asked for the darkest, heavier beer they had and rolling her eyes she said ""Pilsner"". If you know German beer, that is as light beer as it gets; so she recommended the total opposite. I lived in Germany and was letting it slide. She kept with the attitude while we order our food. Some of the members in my party have never been there and asked a few questions about the menu. She just kept acting as we were a waste of her time. When she asked me for my choice, I finally said to her: ""are you ok?"" And she, rolling her eyes one again, said: ""Ja, why?"" And I finally said, ""because since we walked in this restaurant you have had a very sarcastic and nasty attitude and you can now drop it."" She was in shock that I confronted her. After she walked away, the members of my party said: ""I thought it was me who noticed and attitude but I did not want to say anything."" But I did. And here is the deal: The server does not know that some if the members in my dinner party come to Hamburg every week, sometimes 4 to 5 times a month with different colleagues from work and we recommend to each other places to eat. In fact, I thought the food was quite mediocre and I've had much better Germany food in other locations nearby. I will definitely not recommend this restaurant to any of my colleagues any longer and personally, will never step one foot in this place again. (Better food: Restaurant Franziskaner near the lake in the center of town)."
0,"Sadly, this place is a poor representative of Hamburg and the German people.  We came here with our daughter and her boyfriend, who is studying in Hamburg,  and they would not serve us.  They told they did not have space, which is fine. (Even though it appeared several tables open).  When we asked how long of a wait for a table, she said,"" we don't have any space for you.""  All four of us, including our daughter's german speaking boyfriend, agreed the message was rude and because we were Americans.  Warning- if you are an American visiting Hamburg, don't come here.   What I would like to tell the server who was so rude. Please come to Southern California in the USA and enjoy our beautiful beaches. We promise to treat you better than you chose to treat us."
4,The best bakery in town lived across the road and queued up most Sundays for the incredibly perfect bread and brötchen. Worth the funny wait while you can see dramatic scenes of Eimsbüttle mums with their mini twin kids and all the guys passing by hoping for freebies? On of the last good bakeries who not just bake factory prefabricated dough.
3,"Ahoi itself isn't a luxury place, there not much design about this place. It seem more like a coffee to me, but they also offer some food. They also offers really nice view of the Hamburger Hafen, at the same time, can catch up with friends.Because of it this place is quite popular at the weekend, at least when we were there, it was full of people. Luckily we was able to find free spot to sit down. The place is self-service, have to go inside to order. When the pizza is really, the stuff will bring it out and shout the order number, that's how it works here.For me, I really like it here. Having a lovely drink with such a beautiful harbour in the sunny day. It's really enjoyable. If it isn't too windy, I could stay there for the whole day."
3,"Thanks for the great experience. The place had it all, great tasting food and beer. Staff was friendly. Great ambiance. We had no problem getting seated or finding parking. Odd location and a bit tricky to get to.Thanks for the positive experience."
4,"Awesome park for a chill time after work and at weekends. There is a huge greenfield, just bring a blanket, some food and you're set. We played viking chess, people asked to join and we had a good time playing viking chess with strangers.Highly recommended!"
2,"This restaurant exists since forever. The first time I came here I was still a kid. Since back then nothing has changed.The food is still the same, the seats and tables are the same. It's auhtentic chinese food and Dim Sum.I don't give it 4 stars, because yelp tells me ""I'm a fan."" which I'm not. I don't think any normal person would be a fan of a restaurant.I don't give it 5 stars, because it isn't as good as it gets.BUT I still highly recommend this place. It's good ;) And a lot of chinese eat here. The prove of quality."
3,"Very tasty pizza, always a lot of ppl and friendly staff. One of our favorites in hamburg once it comes to eating pizza."
3,"My friend and I had a lovely lunch here today after spending about two hours enjoying the Miniatur Wunderland not far away.Good service (what? yes!) from an attentive waitress who helped with our orders, brought us beer and food and was amazingly swift with the check. She was even able to split it across two credit cards. Yes!I've been craving currywurst for some reason and so that's what I had for lunch. A nice sized sausage with a spicy sauce and a big serving of fries. It perfectly satisfied my craving. And the delicious lager with it? Ja!Free wifi worked well as we tried to work out what we'd do next in this city.[Review 12056 overall, 1839 of 2019.]"
4,"Absolutely amazing. If you are in Hamburg for a few days, I would say this is a nice little visit. Theres a lot of detail to see and easily miss. I felt like one hour was good there but if you are in to this sort of thing, you could definitely stay longer. There were multiple levels and lots of interaction. I think its great for families."
2,"I was there for lunch and it was ok. Nothing really impressed me: overage food (I had salad and my friend pizza), average service, average prices, no atmosphere whatsoever. Also service was pretty relaxed and I had only 1 hr to eat and get back to the office. At the moment there is a massive road construction outside and it's extermly noisy to sit outside. Another reason try another place to eat."
3,"Riad's is a nice little restaurant. It's a little bit dark in here if you don't get a seat in the front room, but pretty comfortable nevertheless. I had a delicious Falafel plate for 5,50EUR from the lunch menu card. For 7,50EUR you can also get a lunch menu consisting of any main course, three starters and a desert. This is what I'm going to try next time, since I still was a little hungry after having had my Falafel plate."
4,"We stumbled onto this wonderful place when visiting Hamburg in 2011.  We were treated with a hip interior, tasty treats, and friendly staff. Owner's attention to details is not only on the food, but shows through each reclaimed materials and objects throughout this depot. Definitely was a highlight of our visit!"
4,"Not the cheapest lunch option around at about EUR9, but certainly a unique one. The various meals that I saw around our table all had a thin, almost soupy sauce, on rice & vegetables with either tofu or meat all contained in rather elegant bowls. I also ordered a green tea, which was a great decision! My colleague, Liron (see her review), had some issues with it being too spicy, but my dish was fine. It is worth noting that they don't serve anything without spice though"
4,"This restaurant was a great and random find. The food was tasty and the service friendly; OK, so my borther and I were the only customers in there, but as we were looking for something good open a little late, this was amazing !!! Highly recommended !!!"
1,"Update: we've been coming here for quite some time and I have to admit, I am getting a bit tired of the service mistakes made here. We were there recently and obviously they were not prepared for the rush which ensued due to the nice weather. Anyway, service was horrible. It took an hour for us to get our starters and then the main course came two minutes later, before we were anywhere near done with appetizers. Drinks took forever too and all around us, tables were complaining. I can understand being understaffed but the past three times we've eaten here, we've had issues with service, orders getting mixed up and things generally taking far too long, even when the place isn't packed. I may come back and update this post if the next time things get better but one more bad experience and I'm giving up on Chilli Club. The time may have come and gone where they focused on the customer.Cool place a bit out there locationwise. I wish it were more central but I guess at some point, the Hafen City will be hopping (at least I am sure all the investors in the Yuppie Island are wishing for)! Anyway, this is a modern, stylish restaurant, bar and lounge combo. They have Asian food and I've always had either sushi or the noodle thing they offer....can't remember the name. Taste great! Drinks are consistent and good, the atmoshpere is pretty laid back and on weekends full, so reserve. This is a place to go if you're looking to trudge on over here. At night, a very lonely place with no one around outside."
1,"In the 'Portuguese' area of Hamburg, a large restaurant serving Portuguese food.  We were asked if we had booked so thought the restaurant must get very busy (it wasn't at the time we got there).  We were shown to a table in a reasonably empty restaurant.Felt the menu was a bit 'samey' and struggled a little to find something 'exciting' to eat.  Leaving the starters and go straight into the mains.  The food was OK but nothing to shout about.Staff were very friendly thought and accommodated my typical English and 'not speaking any other language'.  The restaurant never became busy so not sure about the fuss of 'have you booked'.  Probably would not rush back here but OK to come back if I had to."
3,"Went for lunch on an overcast Tuesday afternoon. Not too busy and we got a table right after ordering. You order with the cashier, pay, and then sit and they bring out your food. I couldn't decide what to order and ended up with the pastrami special that was right in front of my face at the cashier. I asked for the sandwich without bread and over a salad and though confused at first that's exactly what I got! I'm impressed with the customization options here and that the kitchen got it right. The big salad with pastrami and a small bottle of water was 11.60, the ""menu"" price. I was expecting to be charged for the sandwich and the salad so this was a positive. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. Salad wasn't the freshest but it was decent and with plenty of pastrami. I think I was the only person there not eating a burger and fries so I'm assuming they are good too. If I remember well it was cash only, or cash and EC card only so be prepared!"
4,Spaghetti Eis is da best. Also the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had.
3,"Eating here could be classed as an adventure. Firstly, finding it, is rather awkward due to the huge amount of building work going on in the nearby hafencity and the fact it is hidden under a railway bridge. Then theres the quirky 15 degree interior, which looks and feels like you are sliding slowly into the Elbe canal. Added to all this, is the randomness of the seating arrangements, where you could be sitting next to anyone, (and your food could be sliding slowly down the table towards your new friends). However, these can all be considered plus sides as it is a completley unexpected, and quite wonderful experience. The food is excellent, the chef knowing pretty much all theres is to know about original German food, the atmosphere is very friendly (perhaps because its so small and cosy) the drinks are good (standard), and the cost is reasonable. If you fancy a bit of an adventure and are looking to experience something a little different, then this is definately the place. The only downside is that its best to go when its busy to get the true feeling of the place."
4,"Theres something very dark and mysterious about this place that captures the imagingation. The selection of absinthe is remarkable, and the ordering process adds to the feel of mystery. The bar tender is fantastic, offering advice to the novice drinker (me) on what to have, which will aptly suit my pallette. Just brilliant...a unique experience and one which will definately be enjoyed again"
3,What a lovely place.Excellent price value ratio!!We had seafood only!Catch of the day was wonderful.Some very good wines from Portugal and Spain. Quick and friendly service!Location in the heartbeat of Hamburg (Schanze)
3,At the La Piazzetta we got good pizza. I ordered some take away as well. The staff was very nice and the food was good. On top of the pizza we had some pasta and salad as well. The interior is cozy and decorated with Italian themed and soccer themed photos. Enjoy
0,We have waited for one hour to finally get our food :( They gave too many excuses. The food is also NOT satisfied!
2,"Firstly, the food is simple but tasty. A little bit expensive for some eggs and toast though. We we're sitting for ages waiting to be given a menu, maybe you had to go get one yourself, which I ended up doing. Waited another age to be served, the staff were more interested in cleaning tables. It wasn't even that busy. We didn't get the portions of home fries we ordered on the side and had to remind the girl after our main meal was almost gone. They came out 5 minutes later. All in all, could rate it higher of the staff were a little more attentive!"
1,"I think superchristine sums it up really. It is a great place for mid-30's single smokers who like to grind! It's not a great place (esp. upstairs) if you don't smoke, because you won't be able to enter without breathing equipment, and I don't even mind smoking! On a par with mutter there. On the plus side, it does have a nice BBQ and beer garden out back, and it's a bit off the beaten track, still, I don't really go here anymore."
0,Pretty poor experience with Kofookoo. Booked a table for a Saturday night way in advance through Yelp reservations. Table for 4 wasn't available on arrival. Restaurant claimed Yelp reservations do not match technically with their reservations system. Since the place was packed they couldn't offer a place at the bar or table in a appropriate time span. Disappointing.
3,"Great beer, lively restaurant, and, at least to an American, great tasting German food at a reasonable price. Would definitely visit again."
3,"Jim Block used to be my favourite burger in Hamburg, but I've gone off the place recently. They display very little care putting their burgers together. The only things that sets them apart from other fast food burger joints is a) the higher priceb) you get a platec) the ingredients are of a slightly higher quality If you want a burger, are sick of the American chains, and don't want to spend the time to go to a real restaurant, then this is Jim Block's niche. You get a decent burger, no more"
3,"I like that sushi/japanese place.i live just around the corner now! Since they dont have a wide choice of 'sushi menus' (a pre-selected variety of sushi/maki/sashimi), it would be wise here to order one huge dish for everyone. Whenever i am there with my friends, we try to pick a bit from everything and share the entire plate, or else each one of us would be stuck with a 6 piece roll of the same kind of sushi. And their salads are really good, i specially love the sauce! I havent tried the soup, but i have been told it is also good! I am not a saki expert, but when i had it, i liked it!i liked it even more when i got drunk.We had once ordered 2 sakis (as we were 2 persons there) and the waitress got us two 'kettles' of saki, instead of two glasses. That was A LOT for me! but i enjoyed it :) I will definitely be back there soon..."
4,"My wife and I came to this place because of the words of her friends. We had been going to another burger place in town and wanted to see how this one stacked up. We walked in and we're greeted by one of the owners. He sat us and was extremely pleasant. My wife speaks German but I don't. We sat and one of the owners took our order. The owners both spoke English which made ordering easier for me. The menu is in German, but they do a great job of explaining what is on it. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for our food to come, out come the masterpieces. We bit into them and we're immediately taken by how juicy and tasty they were. The burgers and fries were absolutely perfect !!! The toppings were fantastic, and fresh. Everything was perfect when it came to the food. As for the service, it was also top notch. The owners came around and made sure that everyone was ok and were eager to assist with any request. They went above and beyond what I would expect and am accustomed to. They make sure to take care of their customers. I intended to get their names to add to this review, but I forgot. However, I will be updating because we have found our new burger place in Hamburg. We will be returning customers. Pros : 1. The burgers are fantastic. The meat is tasty and juicy but not oily and greasy. They were cooked to perfection. 2. The fries were also cooked to perfection. Not too greasy. They were prepared just right. 3. They make these awesome cookies and cream milkshakes. They are not too heavy and taste great. And this is coming from someone who doesn't usually drink milkshakes. But these were very very very good. 4. As good as the burgers and everything else was, the service was equally as good if not better. They really take care of their customers. Being from NYC, that is something that doesn't always happen. To see such attention to that service was a pleasant surprise. Cons : (Still trying to think of one). All in all, I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I recommend anyone to check this place out. It's definitely well worth it."
0,"Service was from a young man who couldn't speak any German and who's English was very difficult to understand. Jumbo plate was good, obviously basic but what was expected.Red blue and white burger was gross. Way too much blue cheese - unbalanced flavors. Soggy buns. The patty was sub-par as well. Have had a lot of blue cheese burgers in the last year so I know a gross burger when I taste it.Macaroni and cheese tasted artificial and was too strong.To sum it up: the food at Hard Rock Cafe is dated. The times have changed and both the rest of the world and Germany have gotten very good at food and flavor. Hard rock cafes food no longer has that extra something - it has been overtaken by amazing alternatives!"
4,"We had a wonderful meal here. Great food, ambiance and service. You have to try the tartares.  We enjoyed the meat tartares, and the tuna tartare may have been better.  I'm not sure that I've had a truly delicious steak in Europe before, but I had it tonight. We split the dry aged European T-bone and it was superb. Also, sides and sauces are included so this restaurant is expensive but not as expensive as it could be."
4,"Awesome vegan Cafe that serves very yummy and interesting dishes. Not just healthy but also tasty.Only bummer: They only accept cash, so come prepared.Had the quiche with a salad and this definitely feds you up.Highly recommended, even if you're not a vegan ;)"
3,"It's too bad that I'm not a big fan of Absinthe (it's the alcohol content and the aniseed that kill it for me), otherwise I'd probably make this place a second home. There's something mysterious and magical about the Absinth Bar, which reminds me of my teenage years, when we'd all dress up in black and run around the streets at night, hopping from bar to bar and listening to Within Temptation (I'm losing points for this, aren't I). The couple that runs this place are part of what makes this place a must-visit. The guy who served our table was extremely knowledgeable about Absinthe and it's sorts. It was obvious that this place was built around their passion for the drink and it's culture. The establishment itself is small, dimly lit and, well, green. It reminded me a bit of a bar you'd find in Narnia, after passing through the closet. I didn't have any Absinthe, but my friends did - the prices didn't seem like they'd break the bank, but they weren't entirely cheap, either. To be honest, if I would have ordered some Absinthe, I'd probably prefer to pay an extra few euros and get a quality drink. I'm following the age-old beer rule here: the cheaper the beer, the bigger the hangover. Perhaps I'll order a drink during my next visit, since it seems the folks who run the place will probably be able to suggest an Absinthe which my body won't, err, reject. I will, however, take a star off the rating for the seating arrangements in the bar. They are somewhat uncomfortable (hard wooden bench-type arrangements) and I'd like to think that a good Absinthe is at least 40% general atmosphere. Recommended to folks who'd like to try something different for a change."
4,"YES. YES. YES. This is the best wurst in Hamburg without a doubt. My mother grew up in Hamburg and agrees wholeheartedly, so you know it's good. I worked in the area, which was both a blessing and a curse. You'd think after the 20th time visiting that I would get nauseous at the sight of another Thüringer, Bockwurst or Bratwurst, but the closer I got, the faster my heart would beat, the louder my tummy would rumble, and the more my mouth would water. I was addicted. The currywurst is supposedly their specialty, but I don't like my wurst swimming in sauces. Still worth a try if that's what you're into! Otherwise I'd recommend the Thüringer or Bratwurst with fries!"
3,"We went there with 7 other people, of whose 2 greeks.Very good greek food. Good quality/price ratio :) Service was good and fast.Very noisy though, and the porc is really dry. Get some tzatziki with it :D"
1,"Clouds is a beautiful place to have dinner or drinks and I have been there several times. The food and cocktails are always delicious and I would say that they are worth the high price. As a grand finale to my mother's visit from abroad (and first time in Hamburg) I took her to Clouds the night before she flew the 27 hours home. Unfortunately this time I was utterly disappointed and have a particularly bad taste left in my mouth as a result of the service and tipping rationale. Our 'personal' waitress was abrupt and argumentative from the beginning when we simply asked if there were any tables by the window free. She then presented herself as our sommelier saying she could absolutely recommend the perfect wine to match our dishes and went on to dismiss the whole wine list and suggest merely the most expensive red and white wines on the menu. As a wine scientist I found this incredible considering the wine list has many options, and plenty that would have been a far better match. When attempting to discuss the wines with her she was dismissive and simply told me I was wrong by saying that Spätburgunder is the same variety of grape as Pinot Noir. I strongly recommend that your waitresses are trained in wine service (at least) before they claim to be sommeliers.Despite feeling hustled throughout our dinner we enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the restaurant. When it came to the bill I found the cost of the meal and a section below to rate our experience. Having not ticked a rating the waitress pushed me define if I was satisfied, happy or ecstatic with the experience. I was more than happy to give them a rating but found it staggering that the rating was accompanied by a percentage tip (already calculated from the total cost of the bill). Although I thoroughly believe in tipping when it is deserved and intended to tip for this meal too, being forced to tip is uncouth and a significant faux pas on the behalf of the restaurant management (who incidentally, were on holidays and not available to speak to on the night we were dining). My advice - train your staff in wine, don't force the tipping with satisfaction ratings on the bill."
4,"Wow, super entertaining..... For 30minutes, water fountains dance along to music accompanied by a range of lights to change the colour of the water..... Whether you are a tourist or a local, would definitely recommend popping by one evening for this completely free event in planten u blomen park"
1,"This place has mediocre food at best. Been here twice now, hoping the second time it would be better. Oh well, not the case. Service is slow and fairly uninterested. Had to more often than once get up to get the attention of the waitress. Further, I find the ambiance to be pretty boring and not even that authentic. Finally, the food is average at best. I really couldn't say I found it tasty at all. It wasn't bad I guess but I simply expect a lot more from Greek food. It's not that hard to get right, especially the grill plates. They used poor quality meat as well which was really disappointing. Won't be coming back here again."
3,"Very pleasant deli cum bistro overlooking the new concert hall in Hafencity. When building is complete, this will be a great location. Right now, as with many of the places in hafencity you sit partially in the midst of a building site. Not dirty, but certainly noisy. But with tasty salads, expertly cooked pasta (and the not tried but good looking flammkuchen and tartines) this is still a really good lunch spot. And watching Hafencity go up around you is perhaps part of the charm!"
3,Mi Xao Gion was wig! Amazing. Def reco. She Pho Chay was shook. Also loved the spring rolls and the spicy glass noodle salad. Authentic decor too and friendly staff. Check it out. Also seems like most staff speaks English.
2,Convenient and easy but the döner meat isn't the best... there are better places in town. The service is okay. The other snacks are okay. The seating is. Good.
4,"Priceless and a must do when in Hamburg... The park is amazing to walk around, go grilling or just jump into the water...."
4,Great choice for northern German dishes.
3,"Ate dinner at Xeom based on the Yelp reviews. We showed up to a packed house and had about a 10 minute wait before being seated. We shared a table with two other diners in a corner of the restaurant. (Thankfully I'd read that sharing tables is common...)I ordered pho while my husband had curry chicken, and we shared spring rolls. The spring roll wrapper was a lot thicker than I am used to - I wonder if they're not available in Hamburg. The curry chicken was ok, but it had a strange smooth consistency like gravy, with big chunks of carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes. I was surprised to see tomatoes in the curry, but we ate them anyway. The pho was OK, definitely smaller portions than in the U.S., and less cuts of meat. I was given a lemon wedge whereas I'm used to receiving a lime wedge. There was also no mint leaves, beansprouts, or are jalapeño peppers... The table offered a bottle of sriracha, but no hoisin sauce. I was still hungry after dinner.Overall dinner was OK, but just not what I'm used to from the plethora of Vietnamese restaurants at home. Xeom is cash only."
4,Very nice coffee and cakes. It's a tight squeeze in there and a popular place. The Japanese filtered coffees are too pricy but the normal coffees are yummy and worth it :)
3,"What I enjoy most about this dining experience is the location. The view in the Hafencity area is lovely on a sunny afternoon and sets a nice mood in the evenings either for a relaxing or romantic dinner. Perhaps both! The service is warm and friendly, and if you would like to especially try a more authentic dish which is not represented on the menu, kindly communicate this to your host and if the ingredients are available, they are happy to accommodate. Being Thai myself, there are only a couple places in town where I feel I truly receive a taste of Thailand, particularly because of the nature of spiciness that is found in our food, as most European options are more mild.  I enjoyed the curries very much and rice noodle dishes such as the Pad See Ew.The decor has charm and provides a choice of floor seating or a table view near the window that looks out into the harbor neighborhood."
3,Came here with friends from Malaysia/Singapore who live in Hamburg. This restaurant is in the top of their list when it comes to Chinese food. I enjoyed the dinner.
4,"This little place has lovely ""croques"" (sandwiches) and some quite interesting mixtures.Delicious, friendly, sometimes a bit crowded.You can sit outside in the summer."
3,"Ach, das gute alte Meyer Lansky's- immer eine sichere Sache. Ich muss sagen, dass ich den Service hier immer durch die Bank weg erstaunlich gut finde. Die bieten dir schon einen neuen Drink an, wenn der alte noch nicht ganz aufgetrunken ist...naja, ist vielleicht manchmal gar nicht schlecht, wenn es mal ne kurze Pause zwischendurch gibt ;) Hilfsbereit, wenn man an einen anderen Tisch umziehen will und den Cocktail bekommt man noch zu Happy Hour Preisen, wenn man ihn vor dem Ende der Zeit schon mal reserviert hat. 1 A. Toiletten sind auch zu später Stunde noch völlig ok. Was ich allerdings richtig schrecklich finde, ist, dass man in dem Laden rauchen darf. Schade!"
4,"Very good food, amazing view, comfortable atmosphere  the service was not too short and not too long, perfect to spend a relaxed evening enjoying Italian food"
1,"I'm giving Wasserschloss two stars because I love the building and location, but the food was not good and the service was really bad. My partner had the vegetarian pasta, which she hated and left unfinished -- there was no sauce on the pasta, so the dish wasn't integrated.  I had the nothing special currywurst, but I'd asked for ketchup and mayo and by the time I finally got it (after asking a couple of times) the pommes frites were cold. And the bill came late after several requests.  Come here for a beer and enjoy what it offers:  ambience."
4,Loved the hipster vibe + the awesome coffee. Friendly staff and generally great atmosphere. Would have come back for more if only I had stayed longer in town!
2,burger relatively dry. no even real burger bread. side order of wedges was a total joke.
0,"I was suggested this place and brought to it by my boyfriend. As the ambiance is great, the clientele is anything but high class (the service and food was not much better). Not only did this over-involved couple who stared at us from the moment we walked in, made us feel uncomfortable and then to top it off, on their way out they wrote a very unwelcome note to my boyfriend (who did not speak great English at the time) implying nasty things about me and telling him to get up and leave the table. Mind you, we had been there barely ten minutes, not spoken much and I had never met this couple before in my life. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but considering my man and I were not fighting, nor were we having an argument or any other sort of spat, it was somewhat uncalled for and very rude. I know many people think they are so great at reading people, but trust you YOU ARE NOT. So before you think you can go get involved in others lives, maybe think twice. As for my experience at this place IT WAS DOWNRIGHT FUCKING HORRIBLE following that. Potatoes under-cooked, table water was WARM. Do not bother, not worth the service, nor the food, nor having to deal with the over-entitled, under-educated, arrogant clientele that this place attracts."
2,"We liked this place although I can understand how some people may have things to complain about. I found the interior as well as outdoor seating very inviting and service was competent yet somewhat slow. The woman, whom I believe owns this place, tends to stay inside. She seems to be the most service oriented but usually doesn't do waitressing to tables. Anyway, we come here for the cakes and quite enjoy them. The selection may be somewhat limited but they always seems to have something we enjoy. I especially like their assortment of coffees and usually get a ""Grosser Brauner"" which is my favorite. Food here is kind of hit or miss outside of breakfast. You can pretty much depend on their breakfast offering. I'd recommend simply checking it out for yourself. Do remember that if you are sitting outside and it's sunny or a lot of people are out and about in the Hafencity, it tends to get kind of loud."
4,"Definitely a part of town you have to visit. It's not simply one of the stops on a tour of Hamburg. It should be a necessary stop if trying to get a feel for the city. It's bordering on one of the largest construction sites in Europe...the Hafencity. Once complete, the Speicherstadt itself will become even more vibrant. It will also help once the U4 subway line runs to the area. Worth coming to see just to walk around and thereafter grab a coffee somewhere. Near the water and best visited in the summer but just as good when it's cold and less people are out and about."
2,Nice little cafe where you can grab a selection of teas and snacks along with some typical main dishes of pastas etc.Nice areas to sit and chat or if you are by yourself grab a paper and catch up on the worlds going on.
4,"Been there a couple of times and the staff is super friendly. Don't know if everybody, but they speak Spanish ;D.Sure, this is ""fake Mexican"", but even me as an honorary Mexican--lived there some years--I think it's tasty.Vegetarian options available if you're grossed out about meat for the day.My recommendations: burrito carnitas.And they can save you from starving to death since they close about the latest in the area."
4,"I went for the breakfast there... Very very happy about it! It is a buffet, cheap, with a lot of choice (even for vegetarians). I can only recommend it!"
4,"I just like this place the beer is always cold, the music (Indie/Alternative) is always brilliant, the people around are always friendly & easy-going and the barstaff are always genuine folks. The bar itself is retro-style (orange / brown) decorated with some glamorous wallpaper :)They also got a couple of smaller rooms next to the main one equipped with loads of comfy cairs, sofas and stools. All rooms are dimly lit and so make you feel at home easily. Yet it's a smoker-friendly bar which is a disadvantage for me personally but what the heck :) As a plus you could get the chance to bump into the odd rockstar coming from Knust or Schanze. Mutter is said to be one of their fave hangouts after the show."
4,"It's like have your personal chef. If you are in Hamburg this is the place. Excellent service, excellent food!"
3,"One of the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever tried! Dishes are amazing! You can get a big bowl of fried chicken, rice and vegetables for 10€.I'm used to go there with co-workers. Please note that space is really reduced, the restaurant is usually crown around lunching hours (around 12pm - 1pm). Unfortunately, the menu is just in German on a blackboard on the wall (just pick randomly...)"
2,whatever happens do not order the chuck steak! it is a piece of sh...flubber...or fat rubber...if you respect your stomach and want that organ to stay intact...get the sirloin instead. the sirloin was nicely cooked and tasted proper. The waiter was nice enough to refund my appetizer because i had to spit out the chuck steak into the plate....So for the good sirloin and the customer service..this place gets 3 stars for my taste....I really hope they remove the sub-par food from their menu.
4,I go here when I miss Vietnamese food.Only regret is that they do not serve Vietnamese food during lunch hours.
4,"Awesome wine bar with small dishes to eat. Stumbled into this place with a friend who said he'd often walked by but never went in. From the outside it seems fairly generic and average. Once inside, it's a great, old style wine locale. Service is super nice, the lights are kept low, the mixed appetizer plate is extremely tasty and they have hundreds of wines by the bottle and almost as many by the glass. I will definitely be back here often."
4,"Great place to have dinner eating typical food of hamburg: fish!Nice interior, great and nice service, beer and wine, quick service.For us this evening was the last of a few days in hamburg; a real great finish!"
2,"Great burrito, best I've had in germany. Not too authentic (I'm mexican and live in cali so i'm a lil picky) but still delicious. Took a while to get the food, but our burrito was hot till the last bite and delicious. The steak chunks are a bit big and i wasn't too keen on having to use a knife and fork for a burrito. Cool staff, super friendly, and overall a great burrito."
4,"A cozy, tasteful room tucked into a pretty corner of Hamburg. We went for the 9-course ""classic"" menu with wine pairings. A truly wonderful journey through food and wine, punctuated with a main course of Ibérico pork, unbelievably tender and layered with flavors. On each plate, the juxtaposition of varied elements allows multiple facets o taste - every dish having a multitude of flavor complementary profiles. A world-class experience."
4,"We accidentally landed here during peak lunchtime hour, and you could tell from quite a distance that this place is a fav among the locals. Despite a lengthy queue, we got our Döner Dürüm in less than 15 minutes. In short, if you love kebab, this is the place for you!"
4,"Good donairs - crisply roasted bread with chunky lamb meat including enough fatty bits, fresh salad, good sauces - check!Good value for money - be seated with your Mini Döner - check!Friendly staff - check!Cosy in- and exterior in wood and warm colors that feel like Turkey and not like a fast food parlor, including good bathrooms - check!But what really clinches the 5***** is that they seem to be the only(!) donair place in Hamburg that still serves the more expensive lamb meat (for a modest surcharge), which is of course the original Turkish donair meat. Döner Queen nearby doesn't do so any longer - Dubara are the real donair deal."
4,"One of my all time favorites in the Schanze I must admit. Good music, good people, comfy chairs/banks/sofa's. Closing times are rather flexible so I hear (they close at 4am sometimes if there's people around). The look of the place is retro, but that is a normal occurance in the Schanze. It's not huge but it's big enough. Want to chill out and chat and have a cool bottle of beer? This is worth checking out!"
3,"Tasty place if you are looking for Vietnamese street food place. Simple but cozy interior. Friendly service, what else do you expect? Prices are very fair and the dishes are full of flavor."
4,"One of the best steakhouses I've been to  and certainly the best I've been to in Hamburg.I had a Carpaccio with pumpkin pesto, rucola and parmesan as a starter, a 200g (ladies cut) filet as the main course with a side of green beans and bacon. For dessert, a plate of chocolate mousse and brownies, garnished with red fruits.A two-person meal dealt damage of about 150 euros. Considering how much I enjoyed my food, not a large price to pay. Certainly not a cheap restaurant (the starters alone are close to 20 euros a plate, the 200g filet was 35 euros, the dessert 12) but well suited for a once-in-a-while indulgence.Recommended for those who like meat and aren't afraid to get creative with their eating."
4,Tasty pho.  it's quite good.  warm atmosphere inside. place gets full during lunch rush. we walked in and got last table at 11:30 am on a weekday so get there early.  I will definitely come again to try other menu items.
4,"Super great food, great atmosphere, friendly people, city center location. And really cheap prices for excellent food. My favorite place in Hamburg."
4,"Can't believe I am the first one to write a review on this world-class museum! International Maritime Museum in Hamburg has information on absolutely everything related to maritime history of the world: from Vikings to Jacques-Yves Cousteau. The museum was opened in summer 2008 as a home to the biggest in the world private maritime collection. And believe me, this collection is enormous: 10 storeys filled with boat models, sea maps, navy uniforms, weapons, mini boat models and much much more. In fact it is so overwhelming, that I could hardly manage the last storey. Information provided on English as well, there are a lot of 'interaction points' so that you don't get bored. The entry is not cheap but it's so worth it. In two words: highly recommended!"
3,"Spacious cafe & roastery in the same development as the Ratsherrn brewery, which seems to be well placed for getting the sun throughout the day.Service was good & the coffees and cake were equally good and well sized. Someone more discerning with their coffee drinking than me could no doubt delineate between good or bad but I'm more concerned with size & temperature of the drink when it reaches me and both were up to scratch."
3,"Have eaten here a few times and have always been impressed with the food, the hospitality and the service. hey, if it's good enough for Cliff Richard..."
4,"Great DJ, great bartenders, inexpensive drinks, friendly and fun patrons!  Did I mention the bartenders are good looking?  What more can you ask for?  Well, I guess the bathrooms could be a bit better.  If you are in Hamburg, this is definitely a cool place to come check out!"
4,"After reading about this place in the New York Times' 36 Hours in Hamburg, I went to Hamburg just to see this place and I was not disappointed.We spent 3 hours(2.5 hours looking and 30 minutes in the cafeteria where they have several types of beer and free wifi)  there and still felt that we had missed things. The scope was amazing as was the detail.The only reservation that they had online was at 6:30 pm on the day we wanted to go (which was a holiday weekend in Germany). This was a great time to go as there were no lines and very few people.We ate in the cafeteria at 8:30 pm (they stop serving food at 9 pm) but they were still replenishing the food and it was pretty good (3 Radlers and 2 wurst and frites dinners for 17 Euros).They have a coat and baggage check. They also have charging lockers for digital camera batteries. You need a 1 Euro coin to start the charging, but you get it back when you retrieve your charged battery. They know that people take a lot of pictures here and they run down their batteries."
4,"I'm from New York and was looking for a healthy place to get a salad and Daily You is by far my favorite place to eat in Hamburg. Everything is tasty, cheap, and high quality. The chili is very good. The salad bowls are all excellent. I've had both the teriyaki chicken bowl and tofu bowl and both were great. I'd recommend asking for them with lettuce if you want to skip the rice, but either way is good. The pasta bolognese is also very good and comes with an amazingly large portion of protein. The staff were extremely helpful (we only speak English) and the food came out fast. Would definitely recommend."
4,"There's nobody in Hamburg, who doesn't know this place. Why? As you walk down the street at Schanze this bar is the first that looks inviting and worth trying. And I must say, it's nice there, it's stylish, warm atmosphere, clean toilets (i have to say that, cause there are so many bars with utterly ugly WCs). Can get really packed late in the evening. Really good crowd: yound, trendy and cool people, sometimes too cool. It's not the cheapest bar, but also not the most expensive."
1,"This place has lost its ""new"" shine. The lines are a bit more tame at this point but it still gets pretty full. I am no longer as big a fan of the salads and burgers as initially thought. The amount of meat in their salads has significantly diminished, the quality of the salad itself is poor, the burgers less tasty and the interior a bit worn, yet this only slightly. Anyway, with the amount of time necessary to grab food here, the somewhat higher prices than the other burger places and the lack of ""newness"" I'm no longer impressed. It's just another chain and if I am actually going to eat burgers or meat, I want the best. I don't do so often and hence quality trumps quantity. Nevertheless, some friends still like this place so you'll have to make your own impression. I've simply passed my peak admiration for this place."
3,"Stylish place just past the Mercado, about 3 mins walk from Altona station. It's fairly dark and swanky, but the prices aren't too inflated with an Augustina Brau at a fairly standard EUR3.50 a bottle. Good, and indeed, good looking, service, and cool beats. There's a smoking room out the back but down let your friends trick you into sitting in there as it's bloody freezing!"
1,"Tiefenthal is a cafe/bar/restaurant. Unlike the places at Schanze, this one is really ""higher"" class. It's crowded and unfortunately pretty expensive (but hey, you are in Hamburg - so it's not like you are already not used to it). We didn't go for food, just drinks and the cocktails were pretty good. The Tiefenthal is one of those places you can take your parents for a drink, or yuppie-kinda people (no offense). But if there would be alternatives in Eppendorf, I'd rather go there. As far as I can tell, there are none though."
2,We went here due to the yelp reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as expected. The food was only ok and the waitress didn't speak German or English. With a lot of pointing at the menu we got the food we wanted. I guess that during the week there is more staff and the food is better.
3,"Wonderful place with great service. Enjoyed the fine dining very much and great staff added more value. We had salad, stake, Schnizel and cheese collection with a bottle of fine wine. It was lovely and cozy to watch the first snow for Hamburg. Recommend to go and get ready for a beautiful lake view."
3,"Nice location with a nice view to the Marco Polo Terassen. Food was good and service was friendly. If you are looking for a Thai restaurant, can only recommend this!"
3,"Always busy, always full like most Burger restaurants nowadays. You should always plan with a 15-20min wait. The waitress takes your name and calls you up when a table is free. They are very quick and friendly. The burgers are very yummy and the food arrives fast. The only thing I miss when I eat here is that they don't really have dessert. They also have a small selection of cocktails but I wish they had more or at least that they were a bit bigger for the price..."
3,"I have to be honest, this location is the main and probably only Vapiano's I really frequent in Hamburg.  For some reason, I do not stand alone when I say this is the most popular location, as it is not just the food that brings people here, but strangely enough, it is also the most social of locations. On most typical nights, you are crammed onto tables with strangers eating cheek to cheek, elbow to elbow. I mean, at times, we even have to battle it out to hang our purses, coats, scarfs, etc on the hooks that are just not enough to go around.  And do not even try to set your jacket or bag on a chair to store it, thinking that it will deter people away from sitting next to you.  NOPE, major failed plan.  This is Germany, they simply say, ""Ist hier Frei?"" essentially translated into, ""No human being is occupying this chair right? Ok, then please remove your personal belongings so I can plant my hungry butt down.""  Yep, Vapiano's is a hustle.  Hustle to get a tray, get in line, get your order in, get a drink, or stand in a separate area for alcohol, and then good luck getting back in line for dessert later.  Even with all this fuss, we all still go there... The food is not of the highest quality, but it is tasty and moderately priced maybe even considered cheap to the non student crowd, and the atmosphere is somehow posh-casual.  It is kinda like the Starbuck's of Italian Pizzeria food chains, not just in Hamburg, but even when I was in New York City, it is always a similar story and routine.  Local Tip: Go here on Thursday night. For some reason, that is ""the night"" at Vapiano's on Hallerstrasse.  For some reason, people like to be seen here on that night.  I guess it is because the week is almost over and people want to get ready for the weekend, so they come for cocktails, since it has decent food, and is near the train stop, it can bring people living in the areas of Harvesthude, Eppendorf, Rotterbaum, and even Mitte together simply because it is off the U1 Train.My favorite salad is the steak one with shrimp, a bit of surf & turf.  As far as pasta, I love the curly noodles one that has a bit of a spicy beef tip/tenderloin with mushrooms and rucola, and a creamy tomato sauce, yummy.  To drink, if I am not drinking my liquid antioxidant of choice, Red Wine (good for the blood!), then I take usually an Orangina, since it has a cute genie like bottle and a fresh citrus taste to it that goes lightly with any meal you choose, whether soup, salad, pizza or pasta."
3,Very nice Thai restaurant in the Hafencity! Interior is nice and cosy.The menu is great and not too many dishes on there so one can keep a good overview :-)Worth a try
4,Amazing food made fresh. The aroma alone from the outside is enough to attract people to this restaurant. That's how my wife and I ended up here and did not regret it. I'll come back again for sure.
4,"Really cool modern experience. At first I thought all the tech was gimmicky, but I have to say the quality of the food was top notch! Really enjoyed my experience."
3,"If you're looking for something a little more upscale that won't break the bank, this is definitely a great spot to go. Was here for a company outing dinner and really enjoyed it. The menu is quite diverse and they have an excellent selection of Flammkuechen, fish dishes and burgers. There's definitely something on the menu for everyone. I had the ""Fisch Platte"" that was a whitefish, salmon and shrimp scampi (unfortuately cold) -- came with Bratkartoffeln and a small salad. Huge portion but all of it very tasty. A colleague got a burger and he also enjoyed this. It's an old warehouse type space renovated with a large dining hall and smaller rooms off to the sides, seems like a great place for a group to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. To top it off, there is a real ""Trude"" in the back lawn! Massive!"
4,"Simple, small place but food is fantastic. Probably the only Indian in Hamburg which offers authentic food."
4,Possibly the best Italian food I've ever eaten. We had the set 3 course menu for EUR39.95  starter of a prawn salad on beetroot carpaccio followed by veal with mushrooms in a truffle sauce. An amazing panna cotta with fruit to finish. To top this we had a table with a great view of the harbour. It's not somewhere I would normally eat but great for a special occasion.
4,"This is the COOLEST museum/exhibit that I have EVER SEEN!  When you think you are going to visit a tiny recreation of the world via trains...it is even better and bigger than that.  I mean, this guy and his team have thought of everything!!!  The lights go down for nighttime and the sceneries interact with you/change depending on the time of day, etc.  It is so hard to explain the magic of this place.  There are generally lines but so worth the wait.  Block off some time for this one.  This is not a place you want to pop in a run through.  The details are crazy cool and necessitate a lengthier visit.  I wish I could go back and share this with so many of my friends and family members but it is sooo far away for me.  If you are reading this and considering a visit, do it!  You will not be disappointed, but rather left in awe by the creativeness of it all."
2,"Went here last night with a few friends after developing a craving for Mexican food. Overall a solid experience.PROS+ Burritos: grilled in a panini press and finished in the oven. Huge size, and very cheesy. Definitely satisfied at the end of the meal. The grilled chicken had a good seasoning to it, and the dish was improved by the two varieties of habanero sauce. + Service: our waiter was very attentive and pleasant, and answered the questions we had. Service was prompt. CONS- ""Nachos"": are essentially a plate of grocery store chili-lime flavored chips that tasted like they were dumped out of a bag. These were then topped with a sprinkling of pico and a few pickled jalapeños. Served with a small side of guacamole, which wasn't that flavorful. - They have tequila bottles (a decent variety as well) at the bar, but no margaritas. Was very disappointed in this. RATING3.5 / 5. The burritos were great, but wouldn't bother with the nachos again. Would likely check out other places before returning."
3,"I thought this place was called Lahmacun, but I guess the sign also says Deniz Imbiss.. Anyway it's a pretty decent little kebab shop, I think - I was pretty drunk at the time I ate here."
3,"The one time I have been here, I ordered the chicken schnitzel with Spätzle and it was very delicious! I had one of their alsterwassers but this time decided to try out the dark version of it and it was even more yummy than the regular one. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
2,"A pretty good and moderately priced Kebab restaurant in Sankt Georg. The location is quite nice if you're looking for something to eat before a screening at the Savoy theater. There are quite a few choices and the Dürüm that I ordered was quite tasty, but could've been a little fresher."
4,"I had a really enjoyable afternoon here at the weekend. I'd forgotten how fun zoos are, and took great delight in being able to feed the elephants apples, carrots, money - which they pass to their keepers, etc! There are lots of other animals, my highlights included: - weird hare/dog hybrid things- the petting zoo where you can get in with the goats- some turkeys- a horse 15 euros buys you a lot of happiness. Have a look at my photos!"
4,"Have been to this place a handful of times now and the experience never gets old. It's one of those you have to be appreciative of where you are type deal. Literally if you blink you will miss this place bc it's so small but the intimacy will never fade. Hands down some of THE best drinks I've had my entire stay in Germany. Service is impeccable and they also have a coat check. Hope that smoking is not an issue because they smoke indoors with the windows closed. This place is great to let your hair down without having to do the club two step of prepping, dressing up, meeting a guy/girl. You can just come here in regular clothes, grab a drink and make a new friend since you will more than likely be bumping into people even though you may not have been planning to."
4,I really love this place so much! Not only is the food really fresh and well done but also very creative.I had their large mushroom bowl with silk tofu and holy moly! As a person with Vietnamese background I can tell you that this dish was very refreshing and new for me! Service has been amazing and the interior is what I consider very contemporary for vietnamese restuarants: atmospheric and aspiring to re-create the streetfood vibe in Vietnam.
4,"I'm a big fan of Zum Spätzle - I've been here on both of my trips to Hamburg. Both visits were on Sunday afternoons (harder to find places that are open then in Neustadt).There are English menus present and the staff was totally fluent. Both times I was offered to walk through the menus and recommendations on what to order.Both times I ordered spätzle and a glass of wine. Both times I got delicious, cheesy goodness. This place is pretty small - just a couple of tables. I wouldn't be surprised if it's hard to find a seat here during peak hours."
3,"If you are looking for a nice little Italian restaurant in hamburg then you should go there. They serve a really good pizza and also the pasta is good. The atmosphere is quite nice if you don't look at all the Italian kitsch around you. It's very small, so be there on time or reserve a table."
4,"What a nice little cafe! only 20 minutes walk from my house in Grindel, this cafe-bar-brunch-cake-snack place serves nice omelets and yummy Tazza d'Oro coffee. I was surprised at how friendly the service was here and the prices were well decent - a breakfast and two cups of coffee for 8eu is more than a fair deal. This cafe (and Karolinenviertel in general) reminds me of Berlin. I really don't come to the area as often as I should."
3,"It is amusing to travel from America to Hamburg to get a hamburger made with American beef in a somewhat Americanized restaurant, but the results are anything but amusing. The burger had the highest beef to bread ratio I have seen. I usually order burgers medium to be safe, but luckily the waitress pointed out this would be a mistake here and they shouldn't be cooked past medium rare.The filthy harry was good enough that I couldn't help but order it each time I came here. Fries are also tasty. The burger is on the expensive side, but for the quality and quantity that you receive it is reasonable. Also it was a bit of a kick to see Anchor Steam beer on the menu."
3,"Decent beach club which has the novelty of not being by the river, but actually in the centre of the Schanze, so you can go anytime. On the downside, it's not actually near the river... so... you can't see any boats. You get my drift. Come here in summer and bring flip flops. Don't even think of coming without them! The owner is pretty friendly and sorted the Qype team all out with free drinks bands even given our no-notice of a party of 20. They do basic food, chips, bratwurst etc, and it's laid back drinking. Nice. And that's my thousandth review!"
3,"Nice place to have good burger for lunch. Most of personnel speak English which is good. Prices are decent, also I would recommend to share fries with a friend, because I never manage to eat it myself. Only thing they're missing in my opinion is some Menu option (Burger+Fries+Drink), otherwise very nice place."
2,"The number one selling point of Daniela bar is that it's busy at 3am on a Monday. Not many other bars can claim that. It's very popular and very small, and in my mind very much an ending bar - somewhere i'd only really go to because I wanted one more drink, and nowhere else was open."
4,this place is great! good fresh pizza made fast with whatever toppings you want. and it's totally cheap too. i found my pizza joint
3,"good, solid Chinese food -- if you're hungry, you'll be happy you came to this great neighbourhood find.the restaurant itself is unassuming; it's big enough but not fancy.  service was friendly and quick when asked for, and the food came out fresh and fast. the vegetables were delicious, and all the meats we had were done tenderly and flavorfully.  prices are fair, and you do get a good portion.  as with most Chinese restaurants, the menu is designed for family-style eating  there is also a lunch menu that is served from 11am-5pm.my peeps come from Shanghai, so i never got my tastebuds trained for Sichuan-style spicy, so much of this menu was a bit off-limits to me.  however, there are plenty of non-spicy options and i can say they are all yummy!  the restaurant is off of the main street Eiffestrasse, behind a car rental place."
4,"Very cozy place, somehow dark and homey in the evenings, with very nice and friendly staff!"
1,"Just had the lunch buffett.  Not good.  All of the hot food in sauces have thick gelatinous skins, the tempura is soggy, the sushi stale.  Avoid this place, even the beer is bad.  How do you screw up beer in Germany?  We were the only two people in the place for an hour in the middle of lunchtime on a Saturday."
3,"In a one week business trip to Hamburg, I ate green lovers four times: once with a coworker, once as catering for a team meeting, and twice on my own. So I guess you could say I'm a fan of this place! And I'm clearly not the only fan, as there was a lunch line every time I visited (various times between noon and 1:30). But not to worry, the line moves quite fast and you'll be eating lunch before you know it.There are various salad and soup options available, or you can create a custom salad by pointing at ingredients at the counter. I quickly learned how to say the various parts of my order in German (mixed salad, egg, beans, corn, mushrooms, tomato, parmesan cheese, balsamic dressing), though most of the staff is pretty fluent in English. Visiting from SF where a custom lunch salad can easily cost $14, the prices here (around 5-8 euros for a custom salad, depending on what you put in it) seem very reasonable.There's some indoor seating but it's pretty packed at lunch, so you may want to plan to take your meal elsewhere. Though if you do manage to get a seat and are dining alone, not to worry, they have free wi-fi!Healthy, fresh, fast, and reasonably priced, this is a great antidote to the heaviness and grease typically associated with German food."
4,"Are you serious about your coffee? Nord Coast will serve it up perfectly for you. Chemex. Yes. Siphon? Yes. Proper coffee, right here. Even some flat whites! My white tea was also exceptional (I was way over caffeinated to enjoy anything extra jolted). My colleague and I enjoyed our beverages with a front seat view of the beautiful canal (back window). Cafe Nord is bright, spacious, roomy, friendly, professional and sleek. It's a great spot should you need a sophisticated fix in beautiful Hamburg. *grab a loyalty card."
2,"Perfectly good cafe with a good number of seats, music at an acceptable level and a decent range of drinks on offer. A nice selection of cakes too although the ones we had seemed to have dried out to a degree so maybe we were there just a little bit too late in the afternoon."
2,"I was having a nice stroll as I often do in this gorgeous Hafencity I live in, and stumbled up this cafe, tucked inside a brick building around the corner from the Speicherstadt.  The decor really draws you in because there pasty case boasts a nice selection of desserts alongside a bar that opens up to a seating area blended into a mini gift shop filled with books, cards and such. I chose a window seat so that I could not only peek outside but get an overall view of the room.  Great place to lounge with friends because the layout is open and cosy. It feels more like you are sitting in someone's home dining table than in a cafe/restaurant. The meals range from light and healthy to rich and hearty homemade dishes.  I happened to be in the mood for wine and a dessert so I ordered the Kaiserschmarrn.  The wine was very nice, she suggested a glass of French,  Côtes du Rhône.  I really love this dessert, Kaiserschmarrn tastes to me similar of a thick pancake but with the sweet flavors of a sugary donut and served often with a side of berries or sauce.  My favorite is when they serve it with vanilla ice-cream, a dopple of whip cream and sprinkled with a few fresh strawberry slices. Here it was served mainly plain and a bit overcooked and too sugary.  I ate it nonetheless, but would it have been a bit fluffier and moist, I would have enjoyed it more.There is a lunch buffet for those in the area looking for a quick stop, as most people frequenting this area are there for work or tourists taking in the many sights. The main menu is very German with a mixture of Austrian and Northern traditional Hamburg recipes served. Meat and fish are the main components and though it is not an extensive menu of options, there are enough fine choices and it really does feel like a home cooked meal and atmosphere. Prices are a bit higher for such a cosy looking cafe, but I imagine it has much to do with the location being nestled in the main Harbor and historical landmark of the warehouse area.I had the Hamburger Pannfisch once for lunch and it was delicious.  This location is really great to go with a friend for cafe and dessert or even a nice quiet dinner if you happen to be in the area or it is also great for going alone and relaxing with your own thoughts after a nice walk along the Speicherstadt.  During the day, a good spot for a casual meeting on one of the sofas near the window."
3,"Simple place to grab an authentic and really good Italian coffee, pasta, or toasts. Friendly, popular ... and I'd go from 3.5 * to 4.0 * if they managed to clean out the cardboard, boxes, Amazon shipments and stuff on the floor next time I visit. ;)"
4,"This neighborhood has its own soul. Its dark red brick buildings  follow  the canals where many footbridges allow you to travel through these buildings. One tip is to go during the sunrise or sunset, you won't regret it!"

4,"Absolutely worth a visit! Booking your tickets ahead  of time is highly recommended. Alternatively, you can try going on a weekday and being there very early. It worked for us - we only stood in line for about half an hour and got to see most of the exhibition before it got super crowded. There is also a cafeteria where you can get snacks, drinks or meals before starting your tour.The gift shop offers a variety of souvenirs and model trains. They also have their very own newspaper which looks super cute and realistic. Don't forget to take your free copy at the entrance!"
3,"Pretty good Indian food restaurant. We tried the chicken tikka masala, paneer curry and garlic naan. The food came out fast and looked really nice. They put nice little vegetable decorations on top of all their dishes. Not sure if this is needed to be honest, as the focus for me is the taste, not the decorations on top. It was my first time here and we agreed that the curries were simply not flavorful enough and tasted like tomato paste. The Indian curry spices were just not really there. The garlic naan was the highlight however. Hot and buttery and crispy. It could have been a bit more fluffy though. All in all, a pretty good place for Indian food if that's what you're in the mood for. However the search continues for me for the best Indian food in hamburg."
1,"Went there on a Sunday for brunch+ or the reasons why you want to go there* Location & Atmosphere: The only reason you want to go there. At water level, still central but not overwhelmed with the crowd around the Alster a few meters away. Terrace is much larger than inside the restaurant, so you want to go there only on a sunny/warm day. There is also a possibility to sit on stairs with a drink facing the Alster and the city tower.* Food: For brunch there is a corner for 13,8EUR (drinks not included) with deli meats, smoked salmon, green salad, tomato mozzarella, veggies, scrambled/boiled eggs & white/wholewheat bread.- or the no go* Staff: a BIG downer, damn, the ladies there make you want to either go away or throw something at their faces. Attitudes (What for?) / Withering looks (need a moisturizer?) / Fish faces (Aquarium?).If you decide to go, do your best to ignore their lack of customer oriented skills (euphemism)* Food: 13,8eur is overpriced for what's served. Not a single dessert / cake on that buffet corner.The only veggies plate (eggplant, zucchini, carrots) available bathes in oil.Scrambled eggs look like there are made out of an omelette mix powder (really!?), I stayed away.All in All, You pay for the location which might be cool on a sunny day but even for that, staff might ruin the experience... too bad, I wont go again.  I do not recommend the place."
3,"If you are looking for a good after hours spot on a Thursday night in Germany check this place out.  It's a nice bar for the regular fruity bar drinks and also a good regular one.  Keep in mind you might have to wait a little at the bar; however, being from Miami I am kind of used to that in the clubs.  The music was good more hip hop if that what you are into.  I didn't eat there so I cant speak for the food, but I think it's best to go and eat there early if you are hungry.  Otherwise you will be standing up.  I would go again when I'm in town."
0,"Consistently embarrassingly poor service. Definitely not recommended. Food was very good, but the servers/staff were so incredibly bad. It wasn't even worth it. I can forgive rushed service, but running around like crazed lunatics and throwing attitude doesn't fly. Very disappointing. Lame. Just plain stupid."
4,"Possibly the best Irish pub I've been in outside of Ireland. As the host Aiden says, It's 60 square metres of Dublin in Hamburg. Great Guinness, great food, live music, a quiz and even live theatre  it's all done to a very high standard by friendly staff. I've had a lot of fun there and you will too. Slainté."
4,"One very impressive model, amazing animations. I can spend so much time to look all the details."
3,"Been there for lunch. The decoration is very nice and it feels very cosy. The service is ok, but not as friendly as I would wish for in a restaurant.I ordered a duck curry and was surprised when I received a sour chicken soup as a starter. For lunch I wasn't used to that and it tasted really nice. The main course was also tasty and I can also recommend it for people who want the option to order their dishes ""Thai spicy"".Unfortunately the tast has it's price. About 13€ for a lunch dish is already a premium."
1,"Too expensive, poor food, really bad service. Nothing new in this part of town. They truly did their best to fullfill the low expectations for this part of town. Basically the majority (actually all) restaurants I'm the area are quite bad. Some are just less bad but none can be defined as really good. It peeves me that they get away with it because of all the tourists who come through here. Anyway, another reminder to remember not to eat in this part of town. Only place even worth considering is Taparia. Forget the rest."
3,Such a sweet little cafe with awesome cakes. But the vegan range was quite small unfortunately. The mint and ginger tea was great anyway :) thanks for having us !
4,"Very friendly staff, delicious food and not too pricy. They brought out olives, bread, and drinks as soon as we got seated and tolerated my terrible German. I've been there three times and I still have yet to try something on the menu that I wasn't very pleased with. Be careful around the bathroom area though, there is a sneaky hidden step and once I missed it and fell. Thankfully no one saw. But I would hate for anyone else to have the same experience."
3,"Nice coffee shop if you are walking in this area in the mornings.  I must admit, a stopped in here a couple times from being out all night before and would grab a coffee to freshen my mind on the way to University, haha!  Yes, sometimes we would drink during the week and I would pull an all nighter around Grindelallee and would jump onto the U3 to go home and shower then head to University for classes.  Anyways, this coffee shop is next to the U3 exit/entrance depending which direction you are headed and I quite like their coffee to go, friendly service and assortment of pasties ranging from light flakey croissants to more sweet treats like something similar of a cheese Danish.  Croissants are delicious on a universal scale of consistency, you know what to expect, light, buttery, flakey, soft, fluffy and basically delicious calories.  However, sometimes I find cheesecakes or any cream cheese pastry in Europe not quite as sweet as in the US, probably because we really go HEAVY on the sugar, but their pastries here were the perfect mixture of sweetness :)The prices are fair and its additionally a nice Cafe to sit in the mornings with a paper.  It is also nice for a cake, they have lots of cakes here and all tasting very fresh, Mmmmm. Once I had something like a pumpkin/carrot cake with the creamiest frosting that I put in a to go bag but ended up eating it before I even made it to the UBahn entrance which is literally 1min walk outside the door, haha.... I really love Scandinavian themed coffee shops or bistros, when I first moved to Hamburg, I frequented many of these shops around the city."
3,"Prior to my trip out to Hamburg, I thought hamburgers might have originated here!  Anyways, though that isn't the case, I am so glad I found Jim Block!  I had it bookmarked for a cheap, quick, and pleasing eat.  I came here for a very late lunch/early dinner with my boss on a Sunday afternoon.I got the Mushroom and cheeseburger meal, so it came with fries and a drink.  I decided on bottled water as opposed to soda.  The plate was huge and was about €9.  Our orders were served fast.  The burger was messy and covered with a lot of mushrooms and the cheese was perfectly melted.  They have their own signature sauce put on it and it also came with shredded lettuce.  The fries were crisp and I saw many others opted to get a baked potato or side of bread instead.  They also have the option for bunless in which you just get served the meat with toppings.  Her falafel burger was shaped into a patty and she was very pleased with it.  My meal was so big that I couldn't finish it all.  There's mostly communal seating at this very busy location.  And it's kinda cool to see how fast food is different in Europe, as they use silverware!  I would recommend Jim Block for a quick and pleasing meal.  They don't have salads but there's something for a beef eater, chicken eater and the veggie eater."
4,Tucked away just a bit but worth the walk. Friendly staff and stellar pour-over. Will return a number of times before leaving town.
2,"Very nice place but I feel like for the price I payed the amount of food was a bit poor, but tasty"
3,"We didn't book a table but they were able to find us a seat instantly in the main room. The resturant has two rooms first as you walk through the door and the section through a corridor with a display showing the special of the day behind a glass display. Both rooms were busy but not over crowded and all staff were very polite and welcoming.The restaurant is very close to a train station and in an alternative arty district.The decor is very urban and industrial but in a very stylish manner. You can tell all the details and artwork was heavily scrutinised and calculated for the right look.After much debate over the menu we ordered two beers and went with the Lamb shoulder for two at 23 Euros each this was one of the cheapest mains on the menu. We ordered two sides Chantellene mushrooms and mashed potatoe with onions.The drinks came quickly followed 20 minutes later with our mains, the lamb was served on a wooden plaque and our dishes were two wooden chopping boards with steak knifes attached by magnet. This was served with mini side salad of which you could choose the dressing and half a corn on the cob. The waitress charved the meat off the bone onto the plaque board then presented this to us on our table.The food was lovely, the meat was very tender and the sides were cooked perfectly and very tasty. We actually didnt need the extra sides as the portion was quite big. The only negative i could give was the price was quite steap however for good quality food, it will never be cheap. The mashed potatoe was fluffy with mini bits of onion and the mushrooms were sauted in butter and herbs. we orded a espresso and jager after the meal and the total was 70 Euro, not cheap but as we were satisfied this was not a problem. I would recommend this resturant but mainly for an occassion to celebrate."
4,"AMAZING!!!pros:veganaffordableamazing servicewonderful atmospherecons:noneI ordered the Barbecue burger and I actually ended up ordering a second one because it was so deliciousit had a wonderful ""cream"" like sauce as well as a tons of barbecue sauce that was super duper yummy!!the pizza was melty, had a wonderful sauce & it really had fresh ingredients + toppings!! I can't wait to come back to Hamburg and come again!"
4,We love the food there especially special lunchs are yummy :) Its very central and reseanoble prices.
2,Nice Café Bar serving tasty green tea and some fresh selected kind of homemade pies. They were playing cool Music that made a charming atmosphere to our conversation. Quite affordable and almost a standard around the corner. During the Summer the garden is a blast in a students district like that. But somehow the waitress wasn't friendly... WTF ? I will be there again for a beer very soon.
2,It was good to try German traditional type of foods. I liked the restaurant itself and so on. But the fish was very salty for me maybe it's because I'm not German
4,"One of the better meals we had while in Hamburg.  The giant white asparagus was in season and was delicious.  Food was presented in a simple clean elegant manner, and more importantly, everyone liked their meal.  Service was attentive as well."
4,"If you want to drink a glass of wine with a wonderful panoramic view, don't hesitate to go up to this bar restaurant. You will have access to the rooftop where you can chill on the comfortable benches or armchairs. The waiters are kind and they know their products so they can advise you for your order. The only thing is that it's a bit expensive but you will forget the price once you taste their tasty wines."
2,"Surprise to find this place. Food are not bad,  but not surprisingly good anyway. Very friend staff, we really enjoyed it. We like the duck and dim sum which are very good. The beef rice noodle are so so, could be worse. The owner seems well connected so he has many pictures with famous politicians."
2,"I came here during a night out with a friend last week and it was OK. We were looking for quick easy food that wasn't Italian (as he is Italian!) so coming out of a nearby bar saw this place and the hundred or so people inside and decided to check it out. We didn't even realise it was Chinese until we were inside and nearly walked out - often they are just overpriced buffets - but we had a quick look at the food area and decided to stay. This place seems to differ from the usual all you can eat places because there is a pretty good selection of raw ingredients to choose from which are then stir fried in front of you. Plenty of choice of starters, deserts, sushi; enough to fill you up either before or after a jaunt down the reeperbahn! So at just 50 euro including AYCE food for 2, and 2 large beers it was OK. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner for 2 as its big brash and noisy but for pre or post booze fuel stop its perfectly acceptable."
4,"WOW!! What a marvellous place...little India.Simple, easy and unconventional but really great. The food is excellent.I had the most basic food...chicken tikka masala. Indian spicy. And it was very spicy! Just perfect.It's a place for great food and less candle light atmosphere.To sum up: Come around and enjoy!"
0,So you want wine and tapas? Well forget it - your not welcome there if you have that wish. The owner is surprisingly unfriendly and rude and only wants 'real' dinner guests in his tapas hole.
3,"If you see the locals eating here, you know that it's gotta be good...but it was soooooo good. This place was bustling nearly 24/7 for a reason. We passed this place several times of day over the two days we were in town as we were staying nearby and every time the tables were filled...12PM, 6PM or 2AM...this place was putting down excellent food. We came here for some late night goodies after a night out and then more importantly for dinner one evening and I was thoroughly impressed. The ezme and homemade pita bread (more of a cross between pizza crush and naan) as a starter on the table was TOO DIE FOR! Such a great first impression. Then the rest of the food that followed was just a pile of flavor explosions! The meats are incredibly well season and prepared. The vegetables are fresh and all the sauces are lick the platter clean good. Highly recommend this as a stop while you're in Hamburg...at ANY time of day. Only complaint...the place was HOT! Really warm and wish they would use the A/C a little more liberally."
2,"Located in the middle of Portuguese block this restaurant didn't necessarily disappointed but really didn't have anything special. Food was ok, prices were ok. Drinks were ..... small. Being a Hamburg restaurant, I expected fresher seafood. Being a Portuguese cuisine, I expected more flair... Was let down on both ends, but it did served as an ok lunch."
3,This wasn't very peaceful place to eat a lunch because the tables were near to each other and the place was full. But I didn't mind anymore as soon as I saw the prices! I didn't know that it's possible to eat fish so cheap... I had my suspicions until I tasted my salmon with peppersauce and it was purely delicious. The salmon was well done and I definitely recommend everyone else taste it as well.
3,"Had to wait a while as it was super busy, but once we bit into our burgers, it all made sense. The meat was the finest we've tasted in a burger, ever, period. Chips nothing to write home about."
2,"Staff here are really super friendly! They seem serious about their coffee with lots of options on the menu.But it's not a cozy or comfortable place where I'd want to hang out for long, a second drink etc..My non-coffee drink (chai latte) was rather lukewarm, flavour on the dull side. The many happy Yelp voices suggest that coffee drinkers might be luckier here."
4,Great Location when the weather is Bad! :)You should come early in the morning or 2 hours befor they close the exebition! Otherwise it will be maybe overcrowded
3,Fast and delicious!  Tried the wagyu cheeseburger loved how light it was . I would qlso recommended their mochi !
4,"pannfisch is essentially the hamburg's take on fish and chips and yes it's way better. i think they use three kinds of fried fishes. i have to admit that they taste a little funny like every time i have a fish dish in germany. it all tastes funny. lake fish. sea fish. so i guess it is its own taste, but i can grow into that. it comes with senfsauce which is a mustard sauce. good idea. packed with flavor as opposed to your usual tartar suace. and bratkartoffel always wins my heart. and don't forget to get your beer.this place is a one-man operation place. you go to the counter to order and to pay. they are not used to foreign tourists around here. i ordered in german, so i am not sure if they speak english. the bathroom is in the icecream shop next door, which also provides a seamless transition to dessert. 1 euro icecream = yes please. when your CEO works at yelp and he said he liked it, i have to believe it right?"
2,"I wasn't really impressed with this place. I figured I had to get a burger if I was going to be in Hamburg, but the meat lacked seasoning, all the fresh ingredients were cold and the cheese wasn't melted. These are some of the most important parts about a good burger. Also, they don't accept American credit cards so make sure you have cash. (I walked around for awhile looking for an ATM, that was fine!) The truffle mayo sauce is good and the ketchup is regular ketchup. The ""large"" fizzy water was pretty small in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend. I went in on a Sunday around 8:00 and sat right away since I was by myself. Service was pretty quick."
3,"Cool, hip and funky. We sat on sofas in the window and didn't want to get up!Reggae easing through the speakers, cold augustiner and friendly bar staff. We were immediately give a glass of free nibbles which is always an a+ in my book.Wanted to have a quick drink and then meet friends but that turned into a few drinks and a change of plans, friends came to us and we chilled out and watched as the sun went down and the area came to life.(One little note for the geeks: dyson airblade in the wc, for me its cool when places use up to date technology!!!)Go there, you wont regret it!!"
4,"Delicious falafel, great price. What more could you ask for? The falafel kimo has tons of sauce, cheese, lentils, potatoes, vegetables. Falafel in Brot is also great, just more of a focus on the delicious falafel."
4,"Fantastisch und wirklich kaiserlich. Sehr geschmackvoll und mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet. Die Speisen sind authentisch schmackhaft und die Besitzerin (eine echte Österreicherin) sowie die zauberhaften Mitarbeiter/innen im Service sind bemerkenswert aufmerksam und sehr kompetent. Dieses Kleinod mit herrlicher Sonnenterrasse in der Hafencity habe ich für mich entdeckt und empfehle es allen, die den Standard satt haben und das Besondere unserer Tage suchen."
3,"Passing by one Sunday night, I saw the sign outside for Irish music night.  I'm a sucker for any chance of hearing a fiddle, so I popped in, wandered through the upstairs, and found my way down to the basement bar.What I found there was better than I'd possibly imagined --- 15 people with fiddles, pipes, Irish Bodhran drums, guitars --- I even saw a bass leaned against a wall, but not in use.  Good rollicking jigs, and several hours of them.  All instrumentals, which suited me fine.At one point I figured the only way to tell which country I was in was to listen to the two older guys having a loud conversation instead of listening --- and notice they were speaking German.Upstairs is fairly standard ""Irish pub"" look, but the basement decor's a bit odd --- the plaster is painted like huge wood beams and stone walls with ""windows"" opening out on blacklight-illuminated fantasy scenes.  One section of the wall has a sea god who belongs airbrushed on the side of a van.  Very odd.Food, eh?  The Guinness was excellent (though a half-liter instead of a pint), and the fish and chips was much better than I'd expected --- I'd rate it as a good but not excellent chippy.  I'll have to go try something meat-pie-ish, as that's a better way to judge the kitchen.The food was good, the beer was good, and the music was amazing --- I know for sure what I'm doing next time I'm in Hamburg on a Sunday."
4,"Best place to eat turkish food around Altona. Very good quality, reasonable prices, friendly and fast waiters. Daily lunch is 5 EUR. I just know this place during the day. If you park you car outside, pay the necessary fees, there are always policemen around!"
3,"Sehr gutes Sushi, viele Sushi-Variationen, sehr nette Bedienung, frische Zutaten! Preislich etwas gehoben, kein Vergleich zu all-you-can-eat Anbietern."
3,"This place is massive, busy and awesome. I've not really seen anything like it before. Certainly not in Australia! I decided to get what everyone else was having, doner kebab meat, chips and all the trimmings (salad, cabbage two ways, onions etc). I couldn't finish it there was so much. Also came with Turkish bread and tea to finish. Am hoping to go there again before heading home."
3,"4 Stars for the Burger.  My boyfriend and I were too late Saturday night to eat in the main dining room, so we tried the front deli.  It was ok, nice ambience, service and decor, and the food was okay.  However, the burger was great.  Came with coleslaw, fresh tomato and a perfectly cooked piece of burger.  Every evenly flavored and overall amazing.  Onion soup needed a spice pick up.  Would try this place again!"
4,"I loved it! So much food, friendly staff, cool environment! But don't forget to make a reservation."
1,"Overrated Italian restaurant, expensive, laud and busy. My chair was in the middle of the corridor and every time the waiters were hitting on me. The risotto was quite a strange one, couldn't finished it. And the pasta of the day looked like the pasta of last week. Not al dente but overcooked, without personality and taste I was expecting in a family Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Not a place to come back."
3,Pretty good Pho which is perfect for Hamburg's normal overcast weather. I too love their spring rolls!
2,"Not sure what it is about Asian restaurants that they feel it's necessary to have multiple different kinds of stiumulation going on during your meal. I walked in and was bombarded with 1) loud asian music 2) blasting TV with some fishing reality show and 3) loaded newspaper rack.I was tired, and hungry, and it was a block away so I went for it. Under other circumstances probably wouldn't have tried it as the menu doesn't seem anything to write home about. I Had a quick meal of noodles with chicken and veggies, large beer and was out the door. I can say, however, that the noodles were not drowing in MSG which was a nice change from a lot of asian food you find in Germany.The patio DOES seem nice though, and I would go again if that's where I was ending up for the evening."
2,"Cafe is really cool to hang out. Quality of food and drinks is blah! Service couldn't care less unless they know you as a local. I work in the area and do breakfast meetings here. Were I not in the area? Nah, would skip it. Nice but not worth the extra trip."
4,"This is a slightly ""hidden"" restaurant in the Hamburger Hof on the Jungfernstieg. It's my local coffee place as our offices are very nearby. Most people don't know this place by name but have probably walked by it often if they live (and shop) in Hamburg as it is quite central and everyone has walked through the Hamburger Hof at some point. They have very good coffee and the food is quite good. It's a fairly standard type of fare but is always good for a quick meal. I really don't order anything else except for breakfast type things in the morning or salads for lunch but these are favorites of mine. The service is also quite good and there is one waitress who's been there forever who is super nice. I can't remember her name though. The seating is also good because you can be inside, or outside/inside since the ""Hof"" is a ""Passage"" and you have variety in terms of people-watching. Further, they also have seating on both side of the Hamburger Hof completely outside which is nice in the summer months. Finally, it usually isn't overfilled so you can always find a place to sit."
4,"The name is program! I have been here already twice this months and I have to say that the steaks are awesome. The Prime Cut Filet is very tender and definitely worths a try. Friends enjoyed the New York Strip and Rib Eye very much as well. Looking at the sides, I am recommending the leaf spinach and potatoes. Besides, they selection of wines is good. PS: not sure why other people write about cheese burger I haven't seen any on the menu!"
4,"My husband and I were craving a US diner style breakfast and found Mamalicious on Yelp. It by far surpassed our expectations and absolutely hit the spot for breakfast.We ordered the original eggs benedict, a side or chocolate chip pancakes and bottomless coffee. Everything was soooooo good.  Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian but the meat substitutes that came on our eggs benedict was delicious even by my bacon-loving husband's standards. The service was very friendly, the price was right, the filter coffee was great and the venue was very cute and cozy. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were there right after they opened. So we will keep that in mind the next time we come back. All in all, I think this will become a favorite of ours in Hamburg. So excited to have found this place!"
3,If you are ever in Hamburg. Don't miss this place! The schnitzel was excellent as well as the potato pancakes Nice atmospheric. Truly enjoyed. C
3,Probably my fav burger joint in Hamburg. However every time I visit is not consistent.  Sometimes the fries are fresh sometimes there not. I always get the poutine because I am canadian and it's nostalgic. It def one of the best poutines I've had except the gravy is never hot. A poutine should be served piping hot so the cheese curds melt into the gravy!
0,I met the owner upon arrival. What a schmuck. Treated me like he was Donald Trump or something. The place was smokey and unfriendly. Image-conscious wannabes. Stay away. You can get a beer anywhere.
4,"If you like great handmade pizza in 10 minutes, this is a place to check out. They have a creative weekly offering of different pizzas (even vegan and sweet options) are available. The staff is nice and the prices are fair for the central location."
3,"Original Persian food, nice place, wide variety of persian foods, and also some traditional persian I've creams!"
4,"I felt like I am in a good restaurant somewhere in South-East Asia, a real thing. Very peacefull, calm, full of orchids  very differnt from any Asian restaurants in Hamburg. My partner and me tried two different menus and all dishes were tasty, except of curries  too salty.Not as pricy as I thought. Would definitely come back again."
4,The best chicken sandwich I've ever had was from here! Super cute little cafe with delicious food. The staff is very friendly and service is great! It was right in the main area of Hamburg so very easy to find. I highly recommend!
3,Really good restaurant. Highly recommend it! Please try the fried potatoes that comes with spring onions and bacon... spectacular!
3,"Great Sushi in a great location. Food was spot on. The day we visited was super hot. It's a bit on the expensive side, so don't be surprised about your check. I definitely would go again. The waitstaff is friendly and easy on the eyes. Thanks guys."
4,"Great donër! Unfortunately, it seems that everyone else in Hamburg agrees. Around lunch time, expect to have a half hour wait. We saw that one day and went somewhere else; came back to Kardelen at 2:00pm the next day and got food in under five minutes."
4,"This is the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Hamburg I know - they didn't even used to have a menu; rather, those 'in the know' would just order one of five house menu items, like the pho or bun of the day.  Now they've modernized with a one-page menu with pictures, perfect for the old and new fans alike! Very affordable, good home cooking.  Difficult to get a table after noon on the weekends, but it's worth coming early for!"
4,"The light show is really beautiful. I wasn't going to go, but changed my mind at the last minute. I quickly taxied over from my hotel and got out and ran to the park. I was able to make it there by 10:15 (it starts at 10:00) and the show lasted until 10:30. I sat on the side of the lake opposite the large tower on a cement block. It put me the closest to the fountains of anyone, but this also meant I got pretty wet. If you don't mind getting wet, I would also recommend going for that seat."
4,"I feel like I am in an Abbott & Costello movie when talking about this place... ""Where are you going?"" The Daily, ""No, not when, where"" The Daily! ""Ok so you go daily"" ""yes but it's The Daily""!! It could go on and on. But the most important thing here is the food. Not a big coffee drinker so don't ask me how good the coffee the was. The food on the other hand, that I can tell you about. The food here is pretty good and the prices you can't beat. Each day they have a different ""special"" warm meal. However, they always have a choice of delicious soups, hearty pastas, and warm baked potatoes to please the belly. I always seem to get the daily special which my favorite is the lasagna. It just melts in your mouth. The layers of cheese and sauce, and more cheese and more sauce. Ok now I'm hungry. Anyway, to top it all off they have some tasty muffins and cakes as well. Just be sure to beat the lunch rush because it will be hard to find a place to sit!"
4,Authentic Cantonese food!   Large selection.   We enjoyed both the Dim Sum and dinner dishes.    The Kung Pao Shrimp was especially good.
4,"Great coffee! So many different variations, and a small selection of cakes. Very small coffee shop so it can get crowded but they also have tables and chairs outside."
4,"Who would think that Hamburg would make the best burritos in Northern Europe? Don't leave Hamburg without a late drunk binge eating extravaganza at Jim! It is worth every euro cent left in your pocket. Great art work on the wall, fantastic staff and food beyond your wildest hangover dream come true."
2,"I was positively surprised by the many different dishes you can order, even though sometimes further detailed descriptions may help you figuring out what to eat. Waiters were friendly, what actually persuaded me into rating three stars is the fact that portions are a bit disappointing in terms of quantity and that people were loud, also payment with cash card is not supported, anyway i'm definitely going again! Dishes tasted really good."
3,The first time I went to Germany I stumbled on the Schanze by accident. The next time the intent was to hit the Schanze and I ended up at here.  You can start off with drinks upstairs as the bartenders do a great job working their way around the bar.  After drinks and lounging upstairs it's then time to go downstairs after I think 11pm.  Be prepared that it is pretty hot down there if you have on multiple layers as I did.  No matter nothing more drinks can't fix and an escape to the bathroom to peel off a couple of layers.  The music was a great mix of old and new. Great !!
2,"I found the place a bit over-priced for what you get. Standard Thai food without that extensive a menu. Further, service was mediocre at best. No one went the extra mile and it was default all night. Lots of people have already spoken well of the location and ambiance. I'd say it's good but not outstanding. There are better views of the harbor as well as in the Hafencity. Finally, I found the bathrooms to not be that clean. I was already there pretty late in the evening but if you are going to charge these prices, make sure someone is regularly keeping the washrooms tidy. I probably wouldn't go back, mostly due to the pricing for average Thai food. It's worth checking out though if you must do something in the Hafencity and you like Thai. Maybe we just hit a bad night for the chef."
1,"For my (maybe spoilt?) liking sadly the most boring breakfast throughout the whole Schanze. I refer to the Kostbar süß (sweet) now which had the character of a loveless canteen meal: tiny plastic packs of honey (1), Nutella (1), jam (1), cream cheese (1) and butter (1) slapped on a plate.Plus 2 biiiiig, flavourless rolls and a tragic slice of tomato, melon and cucumber. For the price of this (approx. 5 Euro without a coffee) I've had many much better breakfasts around town. Quite a letdown being only topped off by the bored and inattentive waitress. (- And they follow this pattern during the summertime, too, when you wish to sip a beer outside You could do a runner five times until these girls come to collect your money or orders.)"
2,The coffee and breads here are superb but coffee temperature is below mine thoughts! All staffs are friendly....Ofen I go with my friends
1,"This place is a trendy hipster coffee and brunch place. The coffee is very good, the food as well. The decor and look of the place is great. I've been there twice now and the issue is the feel. I felt treated by the hostess not like a customer that should be treated friendly and be welcomed but rather like someone who is lucky to even make it into the door. We got there a few minutes before opening time (10 am for a breakfast place -- weird by itself) and stood in line. She let in about a dozen people. When it was our (my daughter and I) turn she assigned us ""the couch"". Folks that came after us still got tables.  We went to the couch which is an old style leather couch with an old suitcase as table. Very uncomfortable. As we sat there uncomfortably, tables got served first. In addition there were at least 4-5 tables unused. So I went back to her and asked why we were sent to ""the couch"" whereas folks that came right after us got a table. Begrudgingly she said that we could take a table but that they all were reserved, some starting at 11 am, some much later. It was 10:15 am! We didn't plan on spending an hour there so took the table. We noticed several of the other unused tables had ""reserved"" on them with the time of reservation up to 12:30 pm!! Crazy! Anyway, we had our coffee and food (avocado toast which was tasty) and were out of there by 10:50 am. It's poorly managed in terms of seating, with a super snooty attitude from the hostess. Unwelcoming. A few suggestions: drop the attitude and treat people nicely. Get rid of the couch and add more tables. Get rid of the reservation deal for 2-4 people. Early bird gets the worm, especially in a breakfast place! Reservations should only be used for big groups (6 or more) with plenty of walk-in slots."
3,"Superb establishment. Everything everyone has said is true, I realised as much after my own personal cocktail consultation on massage Mondays! What do you like? What tastes, what spirits, what mood are you in? What's your favourite colour? What's your name, where'd you come from, how many. no wait. I got recommended a Hendrick's crush, which contains crushed kumqats! What an invention, a fruit that no one had any use for before, apart from ornamental, of course. Anyway, it was delicious. I've since been back and sampled the flammkuchen (also great) and watched the fish a lot. An impressive tank. On Monday nights every customer gets a free massage too - slightly surreal, but great!"
2,"I was in town on business. I usually take the time to find the local Hard Rock to pick up a magnet from the shop if it is my first time in the city. This time I decided to stop into the restaurant for a late lunch as well.Location: An odd location in that it is not in the ""central"" Hamburg area. Unique, though, as it is within an old port building featuring great views of the port waterways.Food: Solid burger and ok beer selection. Portion was quite large, though, so come hungry.Service: Rather poor. I was there after the lunch rush and the restaurant was pretty empty. I figured I'd be in and out of there pretty quickly, but alas, not to be. My server was quick to the table when I first sat down, however, it was rather tough to get her attention once my food arrived. Spent more time chatting and laughing with the bar staff."
3,"Honestly some of the best Pho Soup and Noodles I have had outside the United States.  The restaurant, though very well located in the innerStadt, was small and very crowded for lunch.  Being a very cold March day in Hamburg having the door open and close at our backs was a bit uncomfortable, but the hot soups and tea mostly made up for it. One can tell that this is a family restaurant.  The service was very nice and fast.  If you are looking for a warm quick lunch this would be my #2 suggestion for Hamburg.  Guess I will have to make a new list!We ordered two green teas, which got cold rather quickly because they are served in bowls, but by the time they were too cold the soup and noodles were there.  I ordered #15, which was viggies in noodles, always one of my favorites. My friend ordered Pho with Shrimp.  We shared the spring rolls which I could tell were made and fried fresh, not frozen.Looking forward to a follow up lunch at Quan do!"
1,"This wasn't a great burger experience for me. I ordered the avocado burger, which was small compared to other burgers at our table. In my opinion, the ingredients were pretty bad - I didn't enjoy the taste of the guacamole or mayo, and the bread and beef were below average. The food was slow to be served, and the french fries were were pretty bland tasting. The sweet potato tasted better than standard, which I would stay away from, but honestly I thought this place was very mediocre for the price."
3,"The whole family checked out Xeôm the other week for my husband's birthday dinner, and everyone left very happy! As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with genuinely happy faces. Everyone was so nice, and the atmosphere was really cool. And the staff was beyond accommodating for a large group of people.The only reason I can't give this restaurant a full five stars is that my own food was not anything fantastic. However, I did try a couple of other dishes, and they were both delicious! Soo I guess it's hit or miss there. That said, I would definitely go back. :)"
3,This is my first salad's place in Hamburg and it turned out to be great. Best thing is you can create your own salad with awesome sauces. There was a queue at lunch time but salad was great.I will definitely go again!
3,"This is a great date location with its hip atmosphere and attractive (and competent!) servers.  The food is aesthetically pleasing, varied and of a good quality.  If you have a larger group though, the volume due to its high ceilings can be a bit overwhelming and the price is quite high though understandable for its location.  All in all, a great place to eat when you're in the area!"
3,"Crispy duck was good, bulgogi as well which comes with kimchi. The soups are ok, good do with an extra prawn and less grease. The price was excellent and service was good"
4,"Good place on a side street with open-air sitting available. Very nice, fast and welcomming service."
4,"Had some excellent Königsberger Klöpse (meatballs) here at lunchtime with great mash potato and sauce. EUR5,90 for a small portion which was very filling. Quick, hot and very impressive. It gets pretty full in here at lunchtime so you may have to share a table."
4,"Great little cafe in the middle of a passage shopping area. They have awesome coffee, as well as ice cream cones. The area is great to sit and watch people going by, and at times in the afternoon there is even live music playing in the shopping area. It is nicely done, and reasonably priced."
4,best rolls in town! check kleine-konditorei.com
0,"Im really dissapointed about this bar..First impression was ok, nice atmosphere, funky interior and good sounds.After 5 minutes I felt like leaving as soon as possible.Its way too packed, dancing is almost impossible, and the 50degrees temperature doesnt feel like any festivity either..The music is good though, charts mixed up with good tunes, house/rnb style. Among the crowd students and older, lost tourists tried to get drunk and create themselves a good night out.Mine was everything except that.. When this old lady with yellow glasses and 60s jeans started to dance like a fool..she must have been on drugs, although that must be a weird combination as she looked like a lost schoolteacher from kindergarten, I had to move myself at least 1m to the left, just to ensure myself not to get involved in her wild expressional, private dance. After my friend Kat almost got smashed to the ground and hurt her knee by some drunk fat yuppies, we decided to leave... I wont be back. But I probably visited Hörsaals worst night..."
4,"This place saved our lives after a train from Denmark arrived an hour ahead of schedule. Super friendly staff even at 6 in the morning. Wonderful sandwiches and amazing sweet potato soup with a ginger twist. Oh, and did I mention? Incredibly cheap, 10/10 would come again!"
4,"An outstanding restaurant! The food was excellent, and the staff's hospitality made for a truly memorable evening. The owner, Franco, clearly loves feeding people and interacting with customers, and the whole restaurant was filled with a great energy. In addition to the great food, the service is what makes this place really shine. I visited this restaurant while traveling alone in Hamburg, and I felt right at home here. I had only the first two courses of the four-course menu (plus dessert and a fancy shot!), and everything was superb - some of the best seafood I've ever eaten! I would have gone for the other courses had I not been so full :) If you are looking for good seafood and a fun, intimate experience in Hamburg, look no further. This place is amazing."
4,"lovely and beautifully decorated place. very good coffee and delicious scones. the whole place gives a very personal feel, and it's a pleasure to spend time there. definitely coming again for more scones!"
3,"I went here for take-away coffee a few times when I was looking for an apartment in the area. I liked that they have outdoor seating so I could sit outside in the sun between apartment visitings in order to drink coffee and read comic books. Coffee was just okay, though, but service was rather exceptionally cheery. Never got an apartment in the area, but if I would have, I'd hop in here from time to time."
1,"i recommend trying food that is not sushi here. last time i ordered sushi from their lunch menu, i found the tuna not fresh enough to eat raw. if color or smell of sliced fish have changed, it's a sign that it is no longer fresh.the atmosphere is good. the restaurant does not really serve Japanese food, the teriyaki menus they have for lunch use sweet&sour sauce and not teriyaki sauce."
3,"There is some construction going on at the street end and so it is not very easy to locate the cafe. Cafe has a very nice seating arrangement - nothing too overwhelming and you get enough space for yourself.. both inside and outside. Prices are not superhigh - though the coffee I ordered wasn't the best I had in a while. But, nice friendly staff and you really feel that you have come to a small home driven cafe in a positive sense. Very close to the station - so you dont need to walka lot..."
4,"Wow this was the best Chocolate Factory tour/experience ever !!!You learn all about chocolate where it comes from, to how it is grown and then the whole process to how it becomes to being a chocolate bar with many tastings along the way.  This is the first tour that I have ever been on that involved so much tasting from start to finish and making your own bar.  At the beginning 5 lucky people can try the beans (that are covered in the white slimy flesh) that come from the big fresh coco pods (first time ever seen a real fresh one not a model version).  I was one of the lucky ones and it tasted a bit like a lychee / melon.  Don't miss out. We then went along and tasted the beans after being roasted, we then made a bar with a choice of approx 10 ingredients to sprinkle all over our bar from gummy bears to nuts, then we watched the machines that made the chocolates from the melting process to the wrapping of the bars. You can even weigh yourself to see how many chocolate bars you would equal to I was around 640 bars. At the end you then get your bar back from the fridge and wrap it up and the chocolate by the way is gorgeous a bit like Lindt.  I highly recommend to any chocolate lover.  The only thing that lets this factory down is that there is only one tour during the day that is in English and that is done at 12:30 so if you want to go along to this place and you can only speak English then don't miss that tour at that time."
1,"Solid drinks, a bit overpriced though. Ambiance is generic / OK, you could smell the toilets inside the bar. It's not living up to its hype. Staff is not very attentive."
4,Great place. Good ramen. lots of variety. May have to wait for about 20 mins to get in
4,This is probably the best place for tasty food and amazing cakes in the world! You really need to try the hot cocoa!
3,"They just finished renovating and have a whole second floor for eating now! It's a great place to grab a quick meal before a movie at the Savoy. Fast and quick, but still pretty tasty. I don't want to know why it's so cheap, but I'll take it."
4,Delicious traditional food. Typical for the portuguese food is fish.We were in a group of six people and got our food all at the same time. Nice service. Price was ok. A reservation is highly recommended.
3,Greek food for the soul ;)im not Greek but i really liked the food and appetizer here.the owner is supper friendly and gave us very good tips on selecting different dishes. :)
4,"If you can make ice cream out of it, you'll find it here. They sell ice cream flavours I would never have dreamt of, and I have to say this is quite probably THE best ice cream shop in Hamburg - if not Europe. The size of the queues all year round will prove me right. Delicious!"
3,"Kebap shop with a  much wider menu than just kebaps. Great outdoor seating with lots of sun; on a sunny day. Additionally, they give you a free salad and bread with your order. I don't know how the kebaps are but I got a dish consisting of lamb, a yoghurt sauce and little chunks of bread, topped with a pretty hot chili. Absolutely delicious. The yoghurt was just adequate to balance the powerful flavour of the lamb. The food also gets prepped very quickly. Definitely a fan of this place for a quick bite"
3,"This place is great for some quick and authentic Indian food. It is buried in a street full of hostels and consequently other nightlife offerings :) Order at the register and receive a buzzer for when your food is ready. I got the Gobi Pakoras and Lamm Curry Thali with the Mango Lassi. The Mango lassi was sweet and offset the meal which was equally as good. I can't imagine the health rating on the restaurant would receive 100% but if a little realness in food preparation and presentation doesn't bother you, you'll love the food!"
0,"This is a mexican restaurant?! More like a nightclub with tables! I'm seriously glad that I ate before meeting friends here. At the door there was a queue of 50 people waiting to get in, all dressed up, on the pull. It was moving at a rate of 2 people per minute. Coming from inside the restaurant was booming dance music. Ok, Ok, I was sorta expecting a bar. I wasn't expecting a meat-market club though. It's not as terrible as my 1 star rating, it's just not my kind of place, and I'll probably not be back is all"
4,"Everything was authentic- the service, food and atmosphere! Would highly recommend. We got both the tikka masala and butter chicken, which were cooked perfectly"
0,"Just my personal opinion: Outstandingly rude security in front, truly incredible. And then once inside, nothing really worth writing home about. If it were up to me, I would go literally anywhere else!"
4,"My new favorite Falafel place!!! I love it when i get so many freebiesi ordered the (number 23) Chicken Shawarma, and while i was waiting for my order, i got a Date-cookie, then a sesame cookie.. and then i got a free falafel! The owner is from Iraq and quite friendlyit did help that we have the same mother language, but stillHe had also offered the previous 2 customers the sesame cookie although they couldnt speak a word of arabic (excluding falafel and hummus). The chicken shawarma tasted really good... i eat everything if its immersed in hummus... A sandwich costs between 3EUR50 and 4EUR pretty fair for the size of the sandwich ur getting..."
4,"update: Kentucky Fried Chicken eat your heart out! This is where the fast-food chicken is in Hamburg. So I finally tried the chicken and it was great. It was also a surprisingly manageable portion, which makes a nice change from a lot of the fast food around. The sign outside says ""Best Chicken in Hamburg since 1966"" and they might not be too far wrong.I really want to try the half-chicken and chips, as it's supposed to be one of the best in Hamburg, however when I went the other week they'd already sold out! Anyway I had schnitzel with hausgemacht pfeffer sauce and it was damn nice. I'll be back to try the chicken one of these days!"
2,"Atlas Restaurant is somewhat hidden in a relatively modern business district in the northwest of Altona. Like some of its surroundings, the restaurant oozes a bit of the red brick loft style that was so fashionable a decade ago. Unfortunately the dining room was rather empty on the evening of my visit, which - together with the empty (except for the cloth and a single candle) tables - made the place feel a bit barren. Service was fast and friendly throughout the evening and is one of Atlas' strong suits. The food, on the other hand, was a bit of a mixed bag. The evening menu is competitively priced (at 28 Euros per head) and includes three courses, which leads one to expect above-average, brasserie style cuisine. The salmon tartar starter was accompanied by pulpo, melted tomatoes and pickled cucumbers - a combination I personally didn't quite understand. The salmon tartar was decent, if a bit bland on its own, but how the other elements should be combined harmoniously eluded me, despite many attempts. The main, Boeuf Bourguignon, was better: the meat was tender and the sauce rich (in a good way), only the vegetables were slightly too tough.Desert was a lovely mousse au chocolate cake with pistacchio ice cream, which left very little to be desired, indeed. Atlas Restaurant is offering more than decent food at a good price. Maybe I'd just caught the wrong day of the week, but I'd probably not go there for dinner again, if the place is always as empty in the evening. Just in terms of food there is little to keep one from exploring the backyards of Altona."
4,"Really liked the vibe, the service was fast. Sushi - amazing, great choices and varieties. The only not so good thing for me was the tempura, it wasnt hot and really greasy. Otherwise- definitely a great place to come on a Friday night!"
3,"A really great falafel place that has cosy seating area and nice food. It's downstairs, really roomy, and free newspapers give you a reason to stay for a bit longer and make more of a meal of your falafel rather than wolfing it down and bailing again straight away. I guess at a pinch the falafel at Falafelstern tasted a smidge better but overall given the ambiance here, and the similar pricing, it is an all-round better package. The falafal certainly was large for the price of E3,50 and the service was friendly. If you are in Hamburg longer then go here and Falafelstern and you will be happy!"
3,A very popular location for dinner on a Tuesday evening - which was a good sign for us as we only had one night to eat dinner in Hamburg. Food service was quick and the food was authentic and tasty. If you want German food in a picturesque river setting and a very comfortable relaxed atmosphere this would definitely be a good choice!
4,"Authentic, old school German atmosphere combined with some German Staples. It's a great environment to experience. And of course, the beer is plentiful. Schnitzel and basically any Würst are safe choices for your first forray or 75th return visit."
4,"First time in Germany and my boss recomended to visit this place after work. It reminded me of a quaint French Bistro that found its place in Germany. I ordered a glass of wine and the potato and leek soup. The soup was a great consistency and pretty filling. Don't forget the bread that was served, in which I asked for some olive oil. I was brought some sea salt that went well with my bread. If you want to relax with a nice glass of wine afterwork. Try Tati's Bistro!!!!"
3,Trendy & HotYoung & creative crowdDelicious & cheapGut & Günstig Perfect for friends gathering and burger sharing. Healthy salads for ladies are adding a good asset of choice
1,"I'm a regular at this location, and today noticed a significant drop in the quality of the ingredients in my JB Caesar Burger. Think less Gourmet Burger, and now closer to McDonald's burger on a plate.Please disregard older reviews of this restaurant, as they are for a different higher quality menu."
3,"Great park! Beautiful! A private public space. Lots of green, garden, and water! Mini golf. Ping pong too! Wonderful for a stroll or a picnic! Makes you realize what we lose when we privatize parks in the US..."
4,"Hamburg has 3-4 very good steakhouses. Meatery is easily the best. The quality of the meat is amazing, the tartars too and most of the other dishes I've tried. The side dishes are perfectly executed as well (the reblochon potato gratin, the very light onion rings and the mushrooms are to die for ). But the meat is definitely the star, cooked to perfection at the desired level of doneness."
3,"Mmmm... delicious, relatively authentic Tex Mex food. Good prices, large portions, quick and friendly service... and yummy! Plus the drink fridge is filled with exotic (read American) drink choices: Dr. Pepper, Cream Soda, Root Beer, Arizona Ice Tea, Corona. If I'm in the Grindelallee and hungry you'll most likely find me here. *The points off are for the cleanliness. If you can help it don't go downstairs to the bathrooms."
4,"The price is a little high and the place a little ""cold"" fancy. but the meat is fantastic."
3,"The location, service, and interior of this place is really nice. The running model train within the whole restaurant adds a cool feel also and I really felt like I was back in the states! Came here for the 4th of July to get my American fix. My partner tried the spare ribs, and I had the crispy chicken sandwich. The spare ribs were awesome, my partner was in heaven. The crispy chicken was nothing special however... next time I'd just go with a regular burger as it seems red meat is more their specialty? We also tried the cheesecake here and it was pretty good, but a pretty small slice for the price. Overall, worth a visit if you need some American flavor in your life!"
4,The best fucking Turkish food in Hamburg. I've been trying different places all week and non of them can compare to here. They use real tandoori ovens and charcoal grill it's truly fucking amazing. Plus the owner is so nice and speaks English. If you're in Hamburg this place is a must I could eat here daily.
0,"If you live near the Schanze and are on a budget, you'll know La Sepia. Likely you've eaten there more than once; I certainly have. I've had acceptable dining experiences there (meaning nothing appalling), but mostly, the quality is mediocre or just a cut below. The service, as mentioned elsewhere, is slow, not attentive, and sometimes just plain rude. To sum up: if it's about the money, you might do all right. But if you can afford it--or if quality is important to you--go somewhere else."
3,"Great location, terrific food, tasty drinks. Very pricy but in total worth it. Do make reservations beforehand if you're interested in a table with view."
2,"I went to this coffee shop yesterday super excited after I saw their amazing tools( grinder, aero press, roasting their own beans etc.). I assumed it would be an amazing coffee shop and even brought my sister and boyfriend to show them the great location I found while visiting Hamburg. When we went to order our coffees I learned that they don't carry any non dairy milk which disappointed me a lot. Seeing vegan food options on the menu made me believe they for sure would carry non dairy milk but I was wrong. I passed on my coffee order after making the barrister aware I can't have milk and was offered a chai latte or tea. Button line is...carrying vegan food options but no non dairy milk was pretty disappointing to me."
2,"I really like what I ordered, a vegetarian burrito without the tortilla (allergic to gluten). I was a little surprised that they didn't have one gluten free option on the menu and think that the price was a bit high for the amount of food I got."
4,"Delicious food, generous portions, friendly staff in cool atmosphere. What's not to like? Can't wait to go there again."
3,"Excellent kebab house with innovative queuing system. You queue, order, pay and take a ticket - then find a seat and your food arrives in about 3 mins! I recommend the mix teller - wholesome plate of lots of stuff. I always get this as the menu choices are baffling. The battered fish looks interested but I've never had it thus far. Friendly staff and bargin basement prices. Worth a go."
4,One of my favourite places! Always get he chicken tikka and samosas!  Nice food for a cheap price! It can be really crowded and a bit of a wait when you go at a busy hour but at the right time it's great!
1,"Terrible service for breakfast, atmosphere is loud and unruly, you usually can't really hold a conversation without practically shouting at each other. We just tried to order breakfast though and they just didn't take our orders, we tried making notice of us in between after she actually cleared our table and told us she'll be back as soon as possible to take orders but didn't come back at all, after 25min and trying to order 2 times we decided to call it a day and left for a different cafe. Definitely not going there again, prices are okay though and I guess I'd recommend it on a less busy day."
0,"Awful service. Everything is so slowly. The waiter make an observation, that I asked him to take an order."
4,A very nice restaurant selling southern german food. The dishes are very tasteful! The athmosphere is nice and the staff is great! You have to order the food at the counter and then it will be brought to your table.
0,Location is great! On the beach with a stunning view of the harbor!Food and service is ok. But they only accept cash!!! In this day and age not acceptable.
3,"After an aborted attempt to visit another restaurant on our first evening in Hamburg we found this delightful little pub. Tucked in a pretty, quieter part of Hamburg near the Hummel statue, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the servers (not all spoke English, but were more than happy to get their coworkers who did, and English menus were available) were friendly and even attentive - not terribly common in Germany! You don't have only one server - the whole team is ready to help you. We were excited to try a craft Pils rather than something from the big breweries, so we ordered a few glasses. After a few inquiries we made our selections from the menu. I wanted to try a dish more local to Hamburg and our server helpfully pointed them out to me - all different herring dishes. I asked which she would recommend and she very helpfully told me that the Eingelegte Bratheringe (a fried herring dish) had started marinating that day, so it wouldn't really taste the way it should until it had marinated overnight and therefore suggested the Heringstopf - a dish with marinated herring fillets in a housemade cream with onions and apples. It came with Bratkartoffeln (fried potatoes) and salad. It was delicious but extremely rich. I couldn't finish it because we had ordered an appetizer (a very tasty goose terrine). The boy had pork schnitzel which came with a nice cucumber and cream salad that we didn't have in any other parts of Germany. Bottom line: The meal was reasonably priced, the service was friendly and efficient, there were Hamburg specialties on the menu, the ambiance was great, the area was pretty and the beer selection was good. Wholeheartedly recommend it."
2,The long line gave me a headache but in the end it was worth it !
4,I simply love it! The best pizza in town! Friendly service and great prices! My favorite party-italian:-)
3,This is a very nice family owned Italian restaurant. I came here for dinner and enjoyed the cosy atmosphere. Better yet it was neither too pack nor was it too loud. The food was alright. Not the best Italian I have had in Hamburg but definitely fair in regards to value for money. The mains are ~8 euros. What I can vouch very much for though is their tiramisu. That was very good and very large! Order one and split between 2 as I did.The most surprising thing for me was this was the first time in my entire year in Hamburg thus far  that a waiter has asked me if I'd like tap water when i asked for water. This is such a rarity in Germany. Anyone that's moved to Germany will know what i mean. That in itself is deserving of an additional star hence 4
4,"This is a great burger joint in Hamburg.  My favorite so far in the burger joints I've checked out in the eponymous city!The closest comparison I can draw is to London's Patty & Bun - Dulf's is a messy plate-full of beefy delights, customizable in many different ways and overflowing with goodness.  The restaurant sits in the Karolinenviertel, which is a millennial area with Notting Hill-like vibes and tons of recent grad-aged people.Dulf's Burger serves 150g patties of Charolais beef - if you have never seen this French breed of cattle, then google it - spoiler alert: they're huge.  Served atop your choice of three different buns: sour dough, sesame, or brioche, the burgers are sumptuous and the toppings are plentiful.I went for the Farmer burger on a brioche bun, which comes topped with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, a fried egg, homemade burger sauce, and overflowing with coleslaw. Dulf's range of homemade burger sauces is quite impressive too: highlights include truffle, wasabi or cumin sauce....Of course, I went for the truffle sauce.I wrote a bit more about it on my blog; beeffanatic.com/2016/11/…"
3,"Nice place for the spring or summer, loads of parking and outside space. Our waitresses were very nice, informative and friendly which always helps for a chilled atmosphere. The service was with a smile and the cocktails and wine were better than expected. We had the set menu and enjoyed the overall experience. Try this place!"
4,"main place to get food for me. it's cheap, it's tasty and it's fast  what the hell more would you need?"
4,"I was on a free walking tour of Hamburg, and was brought to this area. And that's what it is. An area of old warehouses, many of which played a key role in the economic development of this city and country.The place is really photogenic. I was surprised at how many photos I wanted to take. The network of canals flowing between the warehouses create some wonderful photo ops, and it was also interesting to learn about the history of the buildings. I would recommend taking one of the free walking tours for this reason.The Miniatur Wunderland is in the area, so that's another reason to check it out. See my review of that for more info!"
3,"Cheap and nice food but it is always crowded so the staffs are agressive sometimes. So if you don't mind the service, this is a good place to eat."
2,"Bon café, même en été où on peut tout obtenir dans sa version frappée. Dans la série café sans service, pour ne pas citer le nom de la chaîne que je boycotte, en voilà des sympas, en fait.Ils font de bons wraps et bagels de surcroît, le tout sans prétention. Eviter les croissants. On y rencontre la faune gentillette qui part bosser de Eimsbüttel le matin tôt puis les jeunes mères dans la matinée et les pélerins qui lisent le journal, le temps passe. Au fond, on peut apparemment consulter internet. Cartes postales gratuites à la caisse.Carte à points, le 10e est offert. Je perds ma carte à chaque fois... C'est l'intention marketing qui compte, non?"
4,Super great food.  Someone back there knows their way around the kitchen!  Great service.  Extremely friendly.  Nice and reasonable lunch specials.  Very nce atmophere; well decorated.  Grab a bite when you are waiting for the Miniature Museum.
3,"Joh. Albrecht is a large, central, brewery restaurant that serves predominantly German fare. I've only been once, and then only for the beer, which is very good. I keep on telling myself I should go and try their lunch menu, as it's so close to where I work"
4,I was at this qrito last Sunday and I must say I was impressed. I have been having serious withdraws from Mexican food (I am from San Diego) I could never find a place. I ordered a carnitas burrito and filled it up with all kinds of fresh fillings. It's pretty much a Mexican subway and I like that style very much. Heading there today to get a second taste!!
0,"Worst place ever, the most not nice people gathered together and work there, if you wanna ruin your night and evening I totally recommend it."
3,"I really like this place. If I wasn't leaving Hamburg this week, it'd probably become my go-to lunch spot for a relatively healthy yet filling meal. It has a calm vibe and serves mainly German pasta and salad dishes (although not exclusively) and also offers pastries and coffees. There's a daily menu, and I've found the food really fresh tasting. You get served fresh bread with each meal, and the prices are reasonable. Check it out! It's nothing special but a solid place I'd recommend trying for lunch."
4,"What a lovely place. Feels like ""Little Italy"" in Hamburg.Coffee, sandwiches, baguetts and other small things makes the time there timeless.Fantastic place to relax, enjoy and chill Clear recommendation!!"
4,"Beautiful old building, interesting guided tour (with appropriate length). A must see when in Hamburg."
3,"It seems kinda weird that I'm writing the first (English) review of the main Hamburg beach. But I guess there's not all that much to say: It's a sandy beach on the banks of the Elbe in Hamburg. A few notes:- A nice way to get here is to take the ferry from Landungsbrucken.- Be careful when you're near the water's edge. See that container ship going past in the distance? It moves a lot of water, and can cause some surprising waves- There are permanent barbeques on the beach.- There are public toilets- There are restaurants nearby"
0,"Arrived at 7:30pm Saturday with family of 4.  Noticed about 4 tables seated with local Germans.  Despite plenty of empty tables available, we were told ""restaurant is full""...apparently Americans are not welcomed here.  Racism at its worst in a progressive metropolitan area"
4,"I don't really do reviews, this is more of a personal bookmark, so to meet the minimum word count I'll just say it is definitely a chinese restaurant, located in Hamburg."
3,"Been here a few times. Cozy little place with a good selection of burgers to choose from. Love the fries too. You usually order up front at the counter. For the non german speaking folks, the lady behind the counter asks if you want ketchup or mayonnaise with your fries, and if it's a take away or not. The service is quick, and there is outdoor seating available if it's summer (and not raining)."
4,"Great Burger. I went to a place called Peter Pane my first day in Hamburg and this place blows it out the water. Fresh Ingedients, Fresh Beef, Great combinations, very good burger. The only thing I didnt care for was the long wait for our food, but the place was crowded and understandably so. I recommend this place if you want a Hamburger in Hamburg!"
4,Great spot for a quick breakfast.  For hotel guests in the area - skip the hotel breakfast and come here.Food options range from fresh packed ready take away to dine in options.The decor is comfortable and welcoming.The staff were friendly and welcoming as well.  We ate there each morning while in Hamburg because of the great location and welcoming staff.
4,Delicious! The jumbo portion is too much for one person. The prices are right and the curry sauce they use is amazing. This place has probably the best currywurst I've ever eaten. Beats many places in Berlin out of the water.
4,"Really nice Café: I love to sit outside, drinking excellent Cappuccino or Latte! Far to much of good cakes for me...One of my favorite Cafés in Hamburg !"
4,"The food is really good, the price is reasonable for what you get! The food comes a little late, which means is made fresh. And it was fresh! The personal are also very friendly. Next plan is brunch!"
4,"Finally some fresh, delicious and with love prepared food! We loved the place! Definitely a must for foodies!"
3,"Not a perfect taste but good in Hamburg. I tried first time in 2015 and was disappointed, after one year I tried again was much better than first experience. I had miso ramen and it was ok, the soup was thick enough but I'm not a fan of its noodle. Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) was good. If you like to eat spicy food (really spicy) karai ramen with Korean kimchi flavor would be the best choice."
4,"Great park for jogging, dog walking, picnic and just laying in the sun. You can get there really easy for it near elbchausse.I think there was even a bus station right next to the park entry."
4,"The best spätzle in town, the place is really cozy and the people very friendly. If you are looking for german food, this is the best place to have a wonderful experience."
2,Fast service. Decent food. Nothing special but delivers what is expected. Caesar salad was more dressing than salad. My kids loved the place. Go figure.
3,"Reliable old standby for me in Hamburg, as I find myself there at least once a year.  Excellent menu, nicely prepared & presented.  In St. Georg, which has a Villagey, Bleecker/Christopher feel. Decor & atmosphere remind me a bit of Odeon back home in NY."
2,"Been here a bunch of times at this point. I always get the Döner Teller to go but most of my colleagues get the regular Durum Döner. One way or another, the fresh bread in this place is super tasty. The meat is also usually quite good. Unfortunately, the service here is extremely hectic and not at all customer friendly. Actually super annoying is the process of ordering. You pay, get a ticket and wait. No one really makes much of an effort to find out what you want and if full at lunch, it's chaotic. Further, the place is a dive. Each of the many guys behind the counter is covered in grease stains and sweat. Hand washing seems to be a non-issue and I am concerned about these guys touching my food. Finally, the restaurant itself is filthy. It's not inviting from the outside and the interior is quite repulsive. In summary, the food is actually tasty and the bread is the best part. Unfortunately, you have to risk food poisoning when eating here. I do admit at times I say f""§k it and just go for broke. You only live once! :-)"
4,Delicious food & fantastic service! Perfect place to eat with a baby too as the service is excellent and accommodating for all needs.
4,"A good place for burrito lovers and ""alternative"" people.I'm vegetarian and burritos are one of my favourite foods, so when I found this place I was excited to see their menu is conveniently divided into meat/vegetarian/vegan selections - with more than enough choices in each category.The burritos are big and juicy, the kind you have to eat with a fork and knife, and are some of the best I've ever had. When it's busy you might find yourself waiting quite a long time for your food, but the atmosphere is nice and they specifically say that on their menu so there's no surprise. All in all, one of my favourite places to eat in Hamburg so far."
3,"I usually avoid American spots when traveling abroad, but German cuisine isn't particularly spectacular that I felt like I was missing out on the local experience (I could make a killing opening up a spice shop here). Plus, like everyone else said, eating a hamburger in Hamburg is probably one of those bucket list type of things.The decor is... interesting. It seems a little all over the place. Definitely American-inspired but with random Tex-Mex thrown in. Pretty loud space but open enough that you can hear the folks at your table. I highly recommend getting a reservation. We showed up with a group of 5 on Thursday night at 7pm and found ourselves having to wait at the bar for about 30 minutes before a table opened up. That said, the wait staff is very accommodating and will try to figure something out for you.Food-wise, pretty solid. I had the Bronx Jon medium-rare. I'm a fan of the English-muffins-for-buns approach. It's enough bread to hold the burger without giving you an immediate carb hangover. Temperatures seem to err on the higher end of the spectrum (most other burgers at the table were over). For what it's worth, the Bronx Jon isn't ridiculously greasy. All burgers come with enough fries to feed a small army.Nota bene: they only take cash."
4,"OMG, the best Chinese food ever. They have a Chinese menu, and the food there is absolutely authentic. We ordered boiled spicy beef and sour bean with minced pork. It is soooo tasty that I want to lick the dish. The restaurant is not big. We came in 7pm on Sunday, and it was already full. We wait about 20 mins to get a table. And the food didn't disappoint us. I have also ordered several take-away here. The food is also great. Definitely recommend it to others."
4,"We got there pretty late, probably 30min before closed. Still a lot of people there. It is really popular. I had shrimp pho, and my friend had no 7. Both are pretty good. Wanna try the drinks next time. 很好吃，并不是特别地道但是融合的很不错，下次还会再来。想尝尝喝的，看到别的桌喝的，看起来很好喝"
1,"This place was quite an unpleasant surprise. Although we had passed by it often, living quite nearby, we hadn't tried it out. On a sunny day, we saw seats outside and decided to try it out for lunch. We had some wine, a pizza and noodles with gorgonzola and bacon. First and foremost, the prices here are a joke. I live in the area so I know it's not cheap around here. At the same time, the prices here are higher than everywhere around and the portions are smaller. The pizza is a decent size but they forgot one of the ingredients. Further, it was thin-crust but mushy and wet. Nothing crunchy or appealing about this dish. The noodles were bland and I think I counted about 15 pieces (in total) of penne. This as a main course and for something like 12 Euros. The pizza for somewhere in the vicinity of 15 Euro for the ""large"" was ridiculous. The wine, also not cheap, was OK but nothing more. Finally, service was a joke. Slow is an understatement. Disinterested and unprofessional fits the bill.So, why two stars? Well, I really like the decor inside. It is well styled. Further, it's a nice location and if you are only coming in for a couple glasses of wine, fine. I'll give them two stars for deco and location. Otherwise, everything else is a joke.Finally, you better like snobs. The place is usually full of your usual Eppendorfer clowns. Pinks, greens, animal prints, silicon lips, LV bags and so forth. I can usually drown them out and mostly find them amusing decoration for a place. They entertain me well but I know enough people who would gag at their sight and here you don't have to wait long for the ""show"" to begin."
4,Really cosy place where you can enjoy a good coffee or hot chocolate in a very friendly atmosphere. :)
4,Honestly a must try if in Hamburg! The burger bowls are to die for. We also had cakes for dessert and they were AMAZING!!! the staff was really friendly too.
2,Good cocktails. good food. happy hour. service could be better.
4,"I got the best calamaris (baby calamari) here, I love them so much I eat only this food here. So amazing and even my friends tried them and told so. The other food I have tasted from others was also nice but the calamari.... Can´t wait to come again."
2,"My wife and I are still on the hunt for the more American-style Chinese food (e.g. bucket of chicken fried rice), and this place is not that.Dinner was good, but fairly nondescript. I got the chicken fried rice, but there were less than half a dozen small pieces of chicken in the entire thing and on the whole it was rather bland. The fried wontons were good, but the meat-to-dough ratio was a little disappointing. She got a chicken noodle dish that she was relatively happy with, but once again, nothing outstanding.We'll probably be back because it's relatively close, but the hunt for my default take-out place continues."
2,"The place is dark like Ali Baba's cave. You wait minimum 15-20 min. for such simple meal as crouques. Quality of sandwiches is ok, but nothing special."
2,"Why go to Zoë 3 when Zoë 2 is literally nextdoor? It's a question I've only twice had an answer for. 1) Zoë 2 was too busy to get into2) Zoë 2 was closed, but then we realised that Zoë 3 was too They have upgraded this place recently with the addition of sofas, before that it really was tough to make a case for going in. I'm sure it's a fine bar, but you'll never want to go in."
0,kaum fisch nur teig
4,"As a non-smoker I only ever visit Duske & Duske to get my fix of English-language magazines, but their selection is surprisingly large (for automotive titles, that is) and the service is impeccable, in an understated, Hanseatic fashion. I think it's also much more charming than getting the mags at the train station anyway. Once I bought some cigars as a present for a friend, who told me they were top notch quality - they better be, for Duske & Duske's range isn't exactly cheap, but the helpful and competent assistance was a great bonus, particularly as I had no clue what I should buy."
4,"Chicken chil/coconut dish was insane.  Excellent spring rolls ...  Menu changes every week, so expect something good"
3,"Oma's pork schnitzel with fried bacon & onion bits is possibly my favourite thing to eat in Hamburg, and as they also serve Duckstein then you can't go wrong with a visit here. The portions also managed to keep 8 very hungry skateboarders appetites sated on my last trip over, and also the veggie option was a winner with our token vegetarian.I try and eat here at least once every visit, and I've also had a good night propping up the bar sampling the beers. Visit!!"
2,"Value for money: far to expensiveService: needs training, to pushyLocation: interestingFood: good to averageBeen there a few more times invited on business expenses, the concept is interesting so is the location, but thats where the good news ends. Food quality and preparation varies and for my taste it's a notch above average. I used to live for several years in Japan and in California and comparing H&H to the benchmark the verdict is a simple one. How to improve: we all know money is made with beverages: Train your staff to stop being pushy. I am the guest and I will let you know if and when I want a new bottle of whatever. Train your staff on products you offer and of course on  the daily menue. To stay polite I will not post the answers I received on simple questions. Yes you have a nice winelist but where is some ""exquisit"" sake to go with ...? Lastly: attitude ... You want to play in the major league? Well you certainly have the right foundation, but there there is plentiful to improve if you really want to get there. Treat EVERY guest with respect not only your so called whatever VIPs. H&H has a good name in Hamburg I was told, but a name I can not eat, smell or drink for that matter. You guys can do far better. At present it is only 3/5 stars with the third one for the potential. Will be there again in late May. Hopefully we can see some kind of improvement."
4,"Here you'll find the best burger in Hamburg, bar none. So 5 stars.However, they could really do with redecorating. It feels more like a conference room than the cosy meaty paradise that it should be. Ah well, I'm sure they'll sort that out in time.Back to the food. They have a range of about 10 burgers, all of which are going to set you back about EUR12, so they're not cheap. They are however freshly made, using fresh meat, which allows the server to ask How would you like that cooked? Rare, Medium-rare. I went for medium-rare, which anywhere else in Hamburg would be a recipe for extreme food-poisoning, but here you just get the great extra taste.Extra props for having two blue-cheese burgers on the menu."
4,"Possibly the most interesting museum I've been to. The three tours available have you navigate without sight, without sound, or with disabilities due to old age. I did the tour with no sight, and me and three other people were placed in a pitch-black maze with a blind tour guide. He guided us around in an amazing tour. I would definitely recommend visiting this museum if you're in the Hamburg area."
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Sagner's, and tried the northern German specialty labskaus.  The restaurants was a short walk from my hotel, and also was totally local. Luckily they had English menus, and the hostess was quite helpful and could speak English. I also sipped on a tasty local beer. Well priced also."
4,"Das Terzetto ist zu meinem Stammitaliener geworden. Ich habe dort schon meine Eltern, fast alle meiner Freunde und auch Kollegen hingeführt. Das Essen ist wirklich außerordentlich gut, der Service typisch italienisch ;-) und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis absolut in Ordnung.In der dazugehörigen Bar nebenan habe ich kürzlich zusammen mit einer Freundin unseren Geburtstag mit 40 Leute gefeiert (geschlossene Gesellschaft). Unsere Wünsche wurden alle erfüllt. :-)) Würde ich wieder machen!"
3,"(this applies to any Bok location)  great and fast food, especially the Thai curries and mango salad! Made fresh without MSG. Great light taste, and a good value. Highly recommended for a quick Asian meal. The Bok in the Sternschanze is a bit more average rather than budget priced, but has an expanded menu and really excellent food."
4,"Wonderful new little cafe serving home cooked food and thoughtfully sourced coffee and teas. The owners are kind and passionate about the quality of the ingredients they use, which hasn't gone unnoticed by locals as they regularly sell out of what they have on offer. There are also items from their family farm for sale and free wifi :)"
4,"Great local place with an extensive menu, well prepared fresh, local ingredients, good local wine and beer at reasonable prices."
4,"There is no other option than rating this spot with five starts due to it's perfect location. There is obviously no parking and it's best to come by public urban transport and walk the balance. There are some simple food offerings, but they have a good selection of beverages. I also like the approach that they serve a lot of local brands besides the big brands of the large conglomerates. This is a mandatory spot to visit for every Hamburg trip."
3,"The restaurant is decorated in a modern eco-friendly way. Creative menu and chill service. Even though not shown on the menu directly, you can request your pizza to be made with gluten-free ingredients. And it tastes great (which is absolutely hard to achieve for gluten-free pizza)! They nailed it!"
3,Excellent fresh food and impeccable service. Great place for a date. Gnocchi melted in my mouth and small salad looked and tasted great.
3,"Had a very relaxing evening there. The service was professional and friendly. The wines that I tried an the drinks my friend had were all good. The munchies were very good (sweet potatoe fries and a flamkuchen). When the weather turns wet or colder, the inside is spacious and well designed. It's next to a museum and not in a very scenic area of Hamburg (of which there many...). But still very nice. I highly recommend it."
3,"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I came in during the downtime and got my burger relatively quickly. The atmosphere was relaxing and the burger itself was quite juicy and full of flavor. The fries were pretty fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside - always nice, and having mayonnaise and ketchup for free was a plus. The milk shake I ordered was alright and I was all in all pleased with everything."
3,"What a night! Went with a group of 11 and were treated to a tapas style meal selected by the owner which included four flavourful seafood courses: sea bass, sword fish, shrimp flambé and Canadian halibut.  A truly authentic Portuguese dining experience including a beautiful acoustic serenade throughout our meal.  Highly recommend."
4,"Best Dim Sum House in Hamburg! After a long but worthwhile wait, Restaurant Mr He finally reopened (after their neighbour burnt down). We went hoping everything would still taste as delicious and authentic as it did and we were not disappointed! The same super friendly waitress was there. The custard buns are to die for, which we always order a portion to takeaway, and so are the xo sauce turnip cakes and pretty much just everything. We highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Cantonese dishes. The prices are worth paying for the quality food and they're not more expensive than other dim sum places."
2,"Popular for dogs and the HSV. Different paths to choose from. Dogs should be on the line, this is normally ignored, and once in a while the controllers are out and about.Near by is Lüther Park and its beautiful church. The area has cafes which I will notice for the next time"
4,Nr. 88 +++++
4,Geile Location - super Essen! Ich habe noch nie so ein perfektes Rinderfilet mit Scampis (Surf & Turf) gegessen!    Extremst empfehlenswert!
4,"Ein super tolles Event, kann ich nur empfehlen!! macht spaß und man lernt sich besser im dunkeln zu verständigen."
4,"Absolutely delicious combinations of ingredients which left me reeling days after I had dinner there! Asparagus season is in full swing and nearly every sea food dish we had incorporated asparagus somehow, whether it be in the sauce or simply accompanying vegetables. Friendly staff there too made it a pleasant evening. It's also possible to sit outside which is nice on warmer evenings. Dessert, namely Spanish style creme caramel with strawberries, asparagus and mint salad, was absolutely scrumptious! Will definitely be recommending this place to friends and returning there myself! Reasonable prices, especially worth it due to quality of food, and all set menus are def worth a try!"
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (3.5/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
3,"Whenever i go to that place i do the smart thingI get there before 7 pm , because somehow it gets totally packed as of 7 pm. there's always a waiting line at the door. They have an All you can eat offer for 17EUR. You just sit on the sushi bar and have all those plates parade in front of you, they also have some sweets too (which are not that good FYI). the sushi is of course not the best in the world, but for a 17EUR All you can eat buffet, it's very acceptable. i have already been there a couple of times, and i most certainly will be back!"
4,Very cool place. Entrance is 10 euros (less for children). It was very interesting seeing all the cars (and the progression of the car through history). I would definitely recommend doing this. The staff was also very helpful and were able to speak English.There is also a small café and gift shop.
4,"Really authentic, I am a Chinese myself. I always come here, and the quality is good, quantity it's also fine."
4,"This is place is GREAT, you can definitely tell it from how many Asian show up here. I love the fried chicken here , so juicy. Miso ramen and soysauce ramen are both good. The highball was in a wrong glass but tastes good. Finally the desert, mochi is my favorite, and I can't wait to try mocha ice cream next time."
4,Amazing food better than our visit to italy. The restraunt staff was so wonderful. We loved watching the chef cook our food and our mouths watered with every plate. The chef gave my son and daughter an ice cream and came personally to each table to make sure every person was happy and fully satisfied. Wonderful place they take visa Mastercard and dogs :) and my kids wanted to go again for dinner
3,Very nice and ... Thai atmosphere. Good service and very good food. Expensive but quality kitchen.
3,"Froindlichst is an all-vegan restaurant in Winterhude with a variety of foods including burgers, pizza, burritos, and salads. There's also a full coffee and tea menu, a few cakes, and an ice cream section.I had the ""Den Burger"", which is some sort of play on words that escapes my feeble German. It's a lentil patty on a bun with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, ketchup, and some kind of basil cream. It comes served with too few sweet potato fries, and an extra little plate of the basil cream. The burger itself is quite large and filling, and actually pretty tasty. The condiments seemed like too much at first, but when you realize how dense and large the patty is, you're glad to have something to dip it in. The fries are pretty fantastic, but again, there aren't enough of them.To say I was apprehensive about trying Froindlichst would be an understatement. Aside from being a vegan restaurant (a category I mostly avoid), there were a few warning signs. First, my wife had made a reservation online, but when we arrived there wasn't a table set aside for us. Fortunately, there were plenty of empty tables, but this seemed like an opportunity for disappointment. Second, the service was perfectly friendly, but when we placed our order, the sound of juicy burgers hitting the grill didn't exactly emanate from the kitchen. Laid back, they are. Fortunately, all's well that ends well, and at the end of the day, I left satisfied and pleasantly surprised."
3,"Part lobster and fish dealer, part seafood canteen - Hummer (lobster) Pedersen is an institution down in the commercial fish market area.Seating is casual and busy, service efficient; patrons at lunch are a mix of business people from the neighboring office buildings and tourists.Dishes are simple (think fried fish with potatoes; oysters with some shallots at the side; tuna tartare; plain cooked and opened lobster with hot butter at the side) and effective for it. Their wines are very well selected. All at not cheap, but very fair prices.Do yourself a favor and eat here rather than at the garage-style fish roll outlets up the street who will probably even serve their spiny lobster with crude mayonnaise and french fries at the same price..."
3,"1. bad service but good spicy food.2. I'm not a fan of spicy food but I still want to recommend this restaurant for people who like the real Asian food. Because including me, all Asians who like spicy food would go there. At least, the best one in Hamburg. ( Frankfurt has a better spicy food restaurant in my mind haha) 3. only accepting cash!"
4,"I was deeply impressed by the super friendly staff and excellent service. Upon arrival you are greeted by a friendly waiter who takes your jacket and hangs it for you in a separate closet. Even though the bar was packed and they were short by one waiter, they managed to handle the situation in a speedy, friendly and professional way. The drinks were delicious and you can SMOKE! Thanks to the additional ventilation, the air is not too stuffy! Love it! Our waiter Jan was brilliant! He took really good care of us and all the other guests! Another advantage: The bar is open until late!"
3,"Whether or not 20up is your kind of scene it's worth it to come and check out the view at least once while you're in Hamburg. Floor to ceiling windows give a breathtaking view of the Hamburg harbor. When we came it was really crowded and we had to hover to get a table, but once we sat down it was really nice. The drinks here are strong and pricey, about 9-16 euros per drink.  The dress code is business casual and the crowd is a bit more on the mature side. I would put this on the beginning of your itinerary to grab a drink and tick off your list, then walk over to the bars to fill up the rest of your drinking tank. :)"
4,"Just wow! Extremely friendly and helpful staff, impressive food! Anytime! 100% recommendation!"
4,"A good and reasonably priced place for getting lunch. Long queue around noon but fast service. Also, they only accept cash:("
2,"Beach clubs as beach clubs go, just stopped in for an after-work gig and it was relatively empty. Filled up quite fast though. Decent selection of grill stuff, booze and lots of seating actually not in the sand. Sweet location, nice that it's in the neighborhood and don't have to trek all the way down to the river to hit up a Strandbar."
4,"Best museum I have ever visited and my background is in heritage preservation and anthropology so I have seen a lot of museums.Beautiful building which houses 10 floors of what used to be a private collection. The layout, design, and thoughtful displays are amazing! Great children's section on every floor where kids can interact with displays. Each floor is themed starting with cultures earliest interaction with the sea. Navigation, ship building, art, miniatures, sea life, a gigantic lego ship....sooo much stuff. This was one of the most pleasurable museums to walk around, it is serene and dim inside which really sets an amazing mood."
3,"After experiencing Zoe Bar I just had to try out this place. It's a very different atmosphere. The general theme of dark has been maintained. Black floors, black walls, minimalistic lighting. The sofa's are incredibly comfortable and perfect place to chill and chat and watch whats going on from Neuer Pferdmarkt. The sofa's seemed pretty new and in comparison to the disheveled ones in Zoe Bar there was the definite trendy atmosphere present. Service was good although I was a little dissapointed that there was either various Astra's or Carlsberg. The music bothered me a little here. They had a wide range but all played quietly. When they started playing Alternative or trance stuff then that sounded plain strange when it was so quiet. I was there on a Friday night and was surprised how quiet it was inside. There was a lot of action over at Zoe 2 outside. And I had the impression people were coming over and getting there beers and going back over to Zoe 2. I will have to sample this place once more I think. Conclusion: A good bar in a good location. Minus one star for the music weirdness :)"
4,Kopiba is a really nice coffee shop at Neuer Pferdemarkt which we stumbled upon during a late evening (8pm) coffee hunt. The coffee is great and the couch at the far back is perfect for sinking into for a cuddle :) I'd love to come back here. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was lovely.
3,"Nice cosy little pub. Service was very friendly, beer was cold. An open air market was happening in the square right next to this place. Good selection of dishes, the wurst salad was quite good.Came back for breakfast on Sunday. Three eggs, potatoes and sausage was fabulous, just the thing after a long night in St. Pauli"
4,"So we wanted to check this museum out so badly because we had read so many good reviews and heard great things about their collections.  And then vacation happened and we almost ran out of time to see it at all.  But...we had to at least go see the special Dali exhibit that they currently have there.  So glad we did!  If you are a Dali fan, you will love this one.  I wish I could say I saw lots more of their permanent collection but I didn't.  We had to browse through in about an hour and that is nowhere near enough time to see it all.  We knew we were going to miss loads so we mapped out the major pieces/exhibits that we wanted to see the most.  If I make it back to Hamburg I will have to go here first thing and give it a proper tour.  They have a really lovely building and have built an amazing collection."
4,"I agree with Andrew, A meat eaters paradise. I'm surprised to read that no one has reviewed the peppercorn steak special, this steak at a low price of 13.95, come with a salad, green beans and baked potato as well. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! the steak was great, their housemade sour cream made the potato. The salad arrived shortly after our beers. Our server was so kind, always smiling and he read my mind when i was craving more sourcream."
4,"This is a fine place to start your party for the night. It is on the far end of the Hamburger Berg street and I could claim it is one of the fanciest :) When you walk in all you see is a huge bar in the middle, but then when you look to the left there is a lot of place to dance too, and on the right, so to say behind the door, are a number of small tables. When you pass them and go in the direction of the bar and follow the bar you end up in the back of the bar where you have more small tables, which are away from the crowds. It gets packed during the evening (as other places). They have few hard guys that don't let drunks walk in and they got a DJ :) Most of the bartenders are women and they are allowed to take a drink with you.cheers"
3,Nice place for a no fuss no frills stop. Definitely a nice place to read and enjoy a cuppa. Their vanilla latte is heavenly.
4,"Super cute ice cream shop ! The place is cosy, modern and full of charm.They have different and original flavours such as strawberry-rosmarin, salty caramel or coconut-strawberry. If you have allergies, it is really easy to understand how the ice creams are made of, thanks to a colours system. They also create vegan ice-creams ! You can either eat inside or take-away."
4,"This venue is really cool. I've been there three times and I always listened to some good music. The place is unbelievably small, the smallest venue I've ever been to, and the first time I was there I wondered how they could do gigs in there. But the atmosphere there is great and people is there to listen to music. If you want to discover and listen to some underground, mostly German, artists that you've probably never heard of that is definitely the best spot in Hamburg I know so far."
4,Lovely place for coffee or sandwich. Unpretentios and affordable inspite of location. Big enough to accomodate large groups. Wonderful service. First floor terrace overlooking Binenalster channel makes it even more attractive. What else to wish?
3,"I went to Marseille several months ago as part of a work dinner with some colleagues. Since being diagnosed with celiac, it is always up to me to pick a restaurant, and I chose Marseille because there seemed to be relatively little with wheat in most of the dishes (focusing more on meat, fish, and vegetables). I asked when making the reservation if it might be possible to make something gluten free for someone with celiac, and they said that would be okay. However, I was surprised and impressed that when I arrived, they even had gluten free bread for me! The waitress was also very well-informed about the menu, even knowing that certain things like their polenta had been cross contaminated with wheat. Overall, I was very impressed by their care taken for a celiac diner, even though they do not advertise as being gluten free friendly specifically. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed in the taste of the Bouillabaisse I ordered. However, the service was so good that I would be happy to come back and try a different dish sometime."
1,"Haven't been able to taste the burger yet because we have been made waiting for 1h 20 minutes as for now. Basically the service ignored us, taking orders from anybody else around us which came AFTER us. Eventually we had to ask for menus. After 1h10m, when we decided to talk to the manager, he only put up a bunch of excuses. I can now count 6 tables that sat after us, ordered, ate, paid and left before we could even see our burgers...Oh and the drinks are room temperature warm.EDIT:Food eventually came and I have to admit it was really good, make sure you try the different homemade sauces and the fries."
3,"We went here once for breakfast and in my opinion it is a very good price for the tasty breakfast. Another time I tried the pizza, it was a little small in my opinion. The staff was very nice and helpful. One downside was that the street was a bit noisy."
3,"They were super busy when we arrived but managed to give us a table. We ordered quickly and the food came out surprisingly fast as well! I had the salmon, it's was so tasty! Definitely going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
3,"Great sandwiches, and in general their bread and cheese plate was a perfect start to a Sunday. Their barista was good too. It was hustling and bustling with people. I enjoyed having food and people watching :)"
1,"Unfortunately it's only in German. It feels a little uncoordinated when walking through the museum. There's just a lot of text/information everywhere. It was cool to see and I got a little information brochure in English, still I think such a museum, especially in such an international city like Hamburg, should offer it in both languages, German and English."
2,Decent Italian food. It does what it says on the tin.
4,"Couldn't agree more with a lot of the reviews, definitely the best place to get currywurst in Hamburg. It was served in the traditional way, chopped up and with a fresh roll for mopping up all the yummy sauce. Rain or shine you can huddle round a table and awkwardly try and eat this delightful from a paper tray which pigeons swoop in around you. Not a gourmet dining experience but a must do in my opinion."
4,"This museum was very fun. It smells very nice inside, although the spices out on display to smell have pretty much lost most of their smell / blended together with other spices. There were four samples that you could try (roasted chickpeas, sugared chickpeas, and two other sweet things). It was pretty cool walking around and seeing all the different spices."
4,"Super. Super. Super awesome.Showed up shortly after opening to avoid the crowds. The only downside is that the coat check wasn't open yet so I was wandering around with my outer layers balled up.I loved all the detail, the scenes within scenes, the Elbephilharmonic that opens up, the airport with departing model planes, and the full on cruise ship at the end. Like some cheesy metaphor, there is tons to see and enjoy if you only take the time to notice. I went alone and spent nearly three hours here and made full use of the cafe because apparently walking around and looking at little things makes me hungry. Give yourself plenty of time to come, see, and enjoy."
2,This place offers a novel way of serving food with meat being carved directly onto your plate by the staff who are constantly passing your table. The meat was well cooked although the sides were average. Overall we found the experience to be unusual yet fun. I would recommend this to people visiting Hamburg.
4,"What a blast! Really enjoyed this place.  Got there early (0930) and was pleasantly surprised how few people were there already. Spent about an hour just looking through all the models and by the time I was leaving there was of pretty good crowd of people coming in. So I was really glad that I got there early. One thing I was not expecting was all the interaction that you could have with the models they were buttons that you could push to make certain models move. Of course, as a pilot, the airport was my favorite display and I could've spent a lot more time there"
4,Savage spot with great food/service and good Guinness and i know a good Guinness.
3,"We came here for the 6-course house menu, which will keep you there for a very pleasant three hours.The food was good, rich, and portions sized to made sure you wouldn't leave hungry. All taken together, it was relatively heavy food without too many sides that I should probably not have eaten directly before heading home and going to bed... oh well...Loved some of their dishes - particularly the lamb chops - while others were just ok (e.g. the fried duck was overdone and not too refined). Overall, fair value for the price and a good experience if you want to sample some authentic Chinese cuisine while always staying on the 'safe side' for a Western palate."
2,"Wonderful position on the Alster, very nicely arranged and designed. On other hand its quite expensive and waiters are unfriendly. I go there sometimes to bring our friends visiting Hamburg for first time because of nice location but the place is definetely not my favorit."
4,Lovely little spot with excellent food. The lady there was very nice and she had an English menu which was a big help. Portions are large - we had the 3 course special and it was too much - we could have split one and it would have been plenty of food. Everything was fresh and tasty. Vegan & vegetarian options. PS - they are cash only.
4,"To be honest, despite thinking I was sober when I arrived at this bar, looking back I was not! But what I remember is that it was really nice atmosphere, wicked decor, good drinks prices and even though we planned to move on to another bar we did not so must have been good! I also have a vague memory of spinning some sort of music wheel on the dance floor and dancing on my own. So yes, I recommend it and will definitely be going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
3,"The Delta Bistro is really in quite an odd place! You'd be forgiven for thinking you were actually walking into a factory, because, well, you are! It's on the first floor of some sort of cash and carry which is part of the meat market here. You'll be walking down a deserted street that's fairly badly lit with parked lorries stacked on the pavement, and getting a little bit lost before you find it. Upstairs, the seating is very spacious, and the service, although not fast, very professional. Both starter (carpaccio de boeuf), and main (rib-eye steak) were excellent, and the Austrian wine we ordered was very drinkable too. I would tell you how much it cost but my date for the evening paid for everything too, what a bonus!"
4,"I love this place. Feels like a local spot. You get a really nice big plate of food for the money you spend. They are cash only and the girl that was working there at the time I went did not speak great English so I'm not sure if there is only two things offered here or if she was highly recommending the specials. I ordered the first thing on the chalk board (which is in my attached pictures) There is standing tables inside and a small spot next to the window, but the place to sit is outside at their communal tables. You order your food and drink and wait for the bell to ring, then you get your food inside. As an American I didn't know this, but I found it cute. You also bus your own dishes. For the price I paid, I didn't mind, and I wish I could come more often. They are all friendly and it is in a great location."
3,"This bar is in ok. Giving 4 stars for the reason I once reviewed this place as another bar :D So, I suppose, this place has no face. It is just an ok bar with sofas and cheap drinks. It is a great place to go in between, but I would never say smthn like: Oh, lets go to the Roosen today!:)"
3,"We went here for a work lunch. We got a table pretty quick. The waitress was very attentive. The food came very fast which is good if you have to be back at work. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there were some weird small black specks in my drink which may have been dirt or dust... I'm not sure... all the food look great and tasted great. The dessert was my favorite - the tiramisu is amazing!!!! They have a garden out the back which is probably wonderful in summer. Overall good food, good prices, good service!"
0,"Barca is a shame for the leisure and tourism industry in Hamburg!On a sunny day in September we decided to take a pedalo boat trip in the evening and called Barca. Unfortunately they only have one mobile phone and no one picks up the phone. I tried it several times during 3 hours and I wrote an email. We needed to go to Barca without any information as the website does not provide a lot of general info on the pedalos. This left us unsatisfied at the counter at 7 p.m., because a boat rental was not possible anymore. They told us it is to late as sunset is in an hour and they frankly speaking do never pick up the phone. The pedalos looked nice and the landing stage was packed with people chatting and enjoying the fresh breeze.In the end this is the worst customer service I have expected in years. No one ever picked up the phone, nobody responded to my mail so far and the website does not provide basic information on the rental times."
1,"Basic, average food for premium price. I ordered the seafood plate- it turned out to be boiled seafood with a watery sauce and a handful of sliced veggies no side dish, even though it costs 16€. I wouldn't recommend this place."
0,"NOT authentic pho!im asian and live in a viet heavy community so i knownoodles wrong type and broth is wrong flavorno tendon, tripe etceggrolls look like lumpiathis restaurant is scamming the german customers who dont know any better!"
4,"Went here the other day with some fellow english speaking tourists for some food and a few drinks. We really had no idea what we'd find inside, but we were in the neighborhood and hungry enough to eat almost anything at that point so we just went in. I'm so glad we did because the food was absolutely delicious! The cocktails were also really good and the service was great as well. Our waiter spoke english really well and was nice enough to recommend some great drinks and burgers to us. If you're ever in the area and up for eating some great food in relaxing atmosphere, you should try Down Under."
4,Second visit here and it is just as good as always. They continuously add new places and delights to make kids and adults giddy.
0,"Not the best place at all. Australian restaurant with german menus. The ads and the website gave uncompleted info about the food. We went for the chicken wings, but they refuse to give with the excuse we need to book table in advance (information nowhere to find). We asked for kangaroo stake, but they did not even had. I saw ad inside for meet cake, but they sayd its just old ad. In the end i decided to have bison burger, but they mixed up the order. So. This place is no go ever again for all of us."
4,"Really nice Mexican place in the schanze! I was initially worried that I'd not find much to eat on the menu given that spicy food and I don't get along very well, but the staff recommended a few dishes I might like and I wasn't disappointed. I had a really nice mexican sandwich with an omelette and avocado - one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! Recommended for some authentic mexican food for a decent price in the Schanze."
3,I came in on first opening day. Staff is very friendly and food was very good. This restaurant is now on my regular weekly lunch break list. I give one star less because kitchen is rather slow but I give this to quite busy conditions in first days when we were waiting 10-15 minutes just for seats. Will see how things will look after few months. Hope the spirit will stay and food quality will not drop.
4,"Absolutely huuuuuuge!! Everything is made to perfection! No waiting time, affordable prices and very friendly staff! A must for everyone who is visiting Hamburg for more than a day!"
3,"Pony bar - yeah, not a bad bar. In close proximity to the Abaton cinema too, so ideal for a post-film drink/discussion of how intense the latest Rambo film was. Just joking, they don't show John Rambo in the Abaton, but I wasn't joking about how intense that film was. Especially the archery scene. Anyway - packed with students, one sign of its next to Hamburg Uni. The other being that you can pick up their WiFi. There's loads of action here."
3,"PRICEY but it's 20upThis bar is inside of the Riverside Hotel at the highes floor of this buidling. It's worth your time, especially at night while sipping at your 13€ cocktail and enjoying this wonderful panorama view of Hamburgs waterfront through the large windows starting on the ground and going all the way up to the ceiling.Visiting this place is a mix of:Relaxing, spending time with friends, dressed business casual, seeing Hamburg from a different angle, enjoying the drinks and emptying your wallet.No need for reservation, just wait in line.(Only 4 Stars because I don't like to empty my wallet.)"
3,"Great place. Nice view to the B+V docks, good variety of drinks, nice food. Stinky toilets."
0,"Nice cafe with unfortunately really unfriendly and rude service. I can understand stress from the workers when the line is long and there are a lot of people, but no need to slam plates on the counter and roll your eyes at customers."
0,"Terrible service for less than mediocre sushi. For that kind of food, it's better to do a take out from an Imbiss."
4,"Excellent seafood with very affordable price, cannot ask for more! But mind the steps if you're traveling with difficult mobility."
4,Perfect place for perfect ice cream. I love that it is clean and modern with outside seating. The ice cream is fantastic and the flavors include transit as well as some newer trendy flavors. Prices are fair and coffee/tea drinks are also available. I will definitely be back!
3,"Food: 5 stars    Value For Money: 5 starsIt only loses a star because the place has a grungy feel (the total look, the feng shui, as well as the feel of the table tops) but otherwise what you get for your Euros is completely superb.   The sheer variety of salad thingies that go on your falafel plate or into your wrap are just so tasty, so nurturing - - eating here keeps you alive in spades, on high octane.   And the smear of hummus,  and the droozle of tahini - - a bit of olive here and multiple veggie assemblages there,  this is flavor and substance and nutrition in heaping, power-pack format.   And those aromatic, hot falafels on a cool, multi-aspected salad plate - - the concept is knock-out, and the guys behind the counter are fast and adept.   Really, really good tucker."
4,"A really nice little restaurant with high end cuisine. Friendly and relaxed with superb food. I chose the surprise menu, since i couldnt decide which of the delicies to pick. Super friendly waitress, and a dedicated chef who several times came to the table himself. Not overprised at all, and well worth the visit."
0,"I decided to check this place out because it was featured on Lonely Planet's ""Top Picks"" for Hamburg.  I relied heavily on their recommendations throughout my time in Germany, and they did not disappoint with the exception of Oberhafen Kantine.  We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday which you think would be the beginning on the Saturday night dinner crowd.  We walked inside and there were maybe 2 tables of diners and the other tables were marked reserved.  The staff was very rude and told us we could not take any of those tables.  I asked about the outdoor seating, which was completely empty, but I don't think they understood what I was asking.  We sat outside for a moment while we tried to come up with a new dining plan.  A minute later the hostess walks out and writes on the chalkboard that the patio was closed, in a clear attempt to get rid of us.  Maybe this place is more receptive to locals, but my experience as a tourist made me feel completely unwelcome.  If you're an English speaking tourist in Hamburg, I would avoid this place entirely."
2,"Regional food from Franken (Nürnberg) - northern bavaria. The roasts are very good, bratwurst and a nice selection of beers (try meister). Roast potatoes are fried not roasted - minus one star"
4,"What a magical world they have created! Halls over halls filled with impressive and amusing details, this railroad model museum took this art form to another level. Even if you haven't heard of it, it is quite an experience. Although I was skeptical at first, the imagination and skills of the two brothers undoubtably deserve our admiration. It was adorable how they took inspiration from actual travels to the different countries and made the landscapes their own. You could spend days here discovering new details...It was great to see they had several opportunities to donate to the respective countries' struggles- a way to give back in a playful setting. We also appreciated the free beverages and perfectly organized waiting room area while waiting 45 minutes to get in. Proud that Germany has such a wonderfully unique museum to offer!"
3,"Finally a cosy café in Hamburg-Wandsbek! Manyl small rooms with vintage couches. Perfect for breakfast/bruch with friends. Larger brunch buffet on Sunday. Crowded on sunday, so I recommend to reserve a table. Perfect if you bring young kids, because they have a room with some games. One disadvantage is there is no diaper changing table at the ladies."
4,"Food was good, vegetarian and fairly-priced! It was a little hard to find a seat, but that is always a good sign :)"
1,"After having ordered my burger, I almost had to wait for one (!) hour. After about 40 minutes, I enquired into the reasons for the delay and I was told, that there was a huge backlog of orders...Mhmm. Also: EC-Card payments available only for amounts above 15€. No credit cards accepted! Wouldn't consider it a pleasant costumer experience."
3,"I have had many a doner in many a German city, but I am putting it out there - this is the best. I was guided here by a Turkish employee at my hotel, so I had high hopes. They were fulfilled. The meat is sliced fresh, and you have multiple meat choices. The flatbread is pressed and cooked fresh, meaning it's hot and delicious. There are many other choices too, from chicken wings to lamb. The restaurant itself has some tables and is a bit beat up, but fine. I subtract a star because you come out smelling like doner for a day thanks to all of the smoke and poor ventilation in the cooking area. But, it's worth it."
2,"Went there for a business dinner. Recommended by a colleague.The beer is good, but given the fact that they are a brewery, choices you have a a bit sparse.The craft been (only one available) is lacking a proper description.Food is OK. Waiters however were good - friendly, quick. Location is very nice.Noise Level to high for business lunch - unless of course you are looking for Nomunication."
4,"Great caïpirinha !!! If you need to refresh yourself, you found the good place. Katze is a nice bar located in Sternchanze and they have friendly waiters that even gave us water for free. They have a Happy Hour while you can have a caïpirinha for only 4,50€. Don't hesitate, they worth it!"
1,"Was there yesterday, February 16, 2019. Had traveled from Sweden and booked a table several months before. The food gets a strong four but the overall impression made them get two stars. There were so many mistakes in the service of the person who served us. She didn't smile, first of all. We got the impression we were not welcome. We got bread but the restaurant couldn't fix drinks that were not on the menu. While drinking our pre-drink we got the starter. We didnt have time to enjoy either pre-drink or the starters seperatly. At this time the main course came in. A Henssler mix - their specialty, with sashimi, sushi, tempura. We still hadn't finished our drink, nor our starters. Now we also lacked the beer we were supposed to have with the starter. Our waitress did not present the main course, which was strange because there was a mix of a lot of different components. The waitress was still quite unengaged. She forgot the drink for the main course. We had to ask for it twice before it arrived after 30 minutes. Then we had come halfway through our main course.When we had finished our entire dinner - from the moment we were seated at our table to we got the check - it had been 50 mins. We dissapointed and went back to our hotel for coffee and desert."
0,"Had duck with vegetables and rice with peanut-curry sauce. The meat, if it was meat, tasted absolutely artificial and the sauce neither tasted like peanut sauce nor had a kind of curry taste. Somewhat unidentically! The meat was extremely tender and underneath the panade was dough or something. The ""meat"" to my mind was some kind of fake which had no meat content at all. Overall it was a really unpleasant experience. Never again!!"
4,"One of the nicest locations in Hamburg to eat, drink and listen to music. The old LighthouseShip is placed near the Überseebrücken and is painted red. You will find it. You can choose: Sitting outside on deck an drink a bear or eat something or go down into the the engineroom, where a nice bar is placed. There you hear often Live Jazz Music. I think it was on mondays. A few rooms are even a small hotel on board.Enjoy"
4,"Great place to sit outside when the weather is nice;  quiet, casual neighborhood vibe.  The flammkuchen here, is the bomb.  So light it practically floats on air; the balance of ingredients is deft, as it has to be with flammkuchen:  enough flavor to enchant, while not overwhelming.  Top drawer."
3,"Kartoffelkeller was a great place to warm up after spending a cold day exploring Hamburg. Situated underground, there are cellar vibes that are offset with candles everywhere and cutesy decor. The menu is, unsurprisingly, potato heavy so there was plenty for a vegetarian to chose from. I ended up going either the potato soup, which was a welcome surprise because it was served in a small pot with a little candle underneath. We also went with potato pancakes as a starter. The pancakes were crispy and served with sweet jam that made them a better dessert than starter but they were great, none the less. The only reason my review is 4 stars and not 5 is that Kartoffelkeller was a bit expensive for having a potato heavy menu. Being flagged as touristy and in a tourist district that isn't too surprising but worth noting. Overall, I would certainly go again for the food and experience."
3,Pizza Siciliana was great but the pizza Diavola was extremely spicy! I love spicy food but it was too much.
3,"Watched Deutschland lose their World Cup match here, which hurt the mood, but the food and beer were very good. I actually had the best Schweinshaxe ever and most of the time it is pretty good anywhere, you really need at least 2 people so don't order any apps if you go for that glorious piece of pork. Nice friendly service and good place to catch some sports action!"
2,"Marsbar - for that little taste of Munich and Düsseldorf right in the west of Hamburg! I went there with a mate due to the simple fact that he likes the wine by the glass there. I hadn't visited the place before, because I know it's a favourite hangout of the Eppendorf Glitterati and hence doesn't exactly suit me down to the ground. Yet that evening at Marsbar turned out to be much more interesting than what I'd bargained for But first things first: the vain bodybuilder-cum-waiter is in place, as is an abundance of the cashmere-clad wealthy. It can get rather crowded, even though Falkenried isn't exactly the cosiest of places - but to see and be seen is apparently of much greater importance than an inviting atmosphere to many. As it got dark, things got a lot more interesting: there was the loud, aging gold-digger (-turned-wife?), whose favourite pastime seems to be shouting names in her loudest voice, especially when she sees a rather well-known German TV chef sitting at the other end of the terrace. After a few more people's names she changed her approach and screamed the names of some holiday resorts. Needless to say, her voice was of the shrill kind and hard to overhear. Yet Madmoiselle Namedropper wasn't the lady that left the biggest impression. That honour must go to a 40-something, sitting together with a bunch of obviously well-off friends, having a glass of wine. So far, so unimpressive - if it wasn't for the fact that she was obviously at her 15th glas and pissed senselessly. At first I thought it was some kind of candid camera comedy performance, but any sense of fun was lost when she, still sitting on her chair, fell to the side, not moving for a few seconds. One could hear a needle drop for a few moments, until a waiter (not Jean-Claude van Damme's bigger brother, but another, friendlier one) came to her rescue. And this was when I really couldn't believe my own eyes: not only couldn't her friends be arsed to help her, they also didn't feel bothered to take her home and to bed, preferring to stay until last orders instead. While Ms Boozer was still babbling and swaying relentlessly. I guess the Eppendorf Glitterati have their own etiquette It may be unfair that this grotesque evening will forever dominate my impression of Marsbar, but a bar is very much defined by its costumers. And, based on this visit, I have to say they're a strange lot. Apart from that I can commend their Ginger Ale (served with ice and a slice of orange!) and mint tea - the drinks selection in general seems to be decent, tough not exactly cheap. So go there if you consider yourself part of the upper class hoi polloi or if you have a penchant for the weirdly embarrassing. Just know what you can expect."
3,"A good spot! Menu is heavy on burgers (probably shouldn't be surprised, though), but the salad -- the salad was amazing. Still thinking about it a day later. If I were here longer I'd go back!"
0,"Absolutely disappointing.Burgers barely have any substance, the homemade ice tea was terrible and there is no service"
2,"This is just another Asian in the line of those which are pretty far from original Asian food. Vegetable is not cooked enough, most of the dishes are way to spicy and place is mostly empty which makes it even more unatractive. Service staff is good but that's about it."
3,Ordered burger champignon and tartufo. Both good. CP - value good. An economic choice in between all touristic places.
3,"Cool bar in between St. Pauli and the Schanze. They sell Pilsner Urquell pretty cheap and have a cool open mic night, which is what I was there for. The only drawback with this place is that it's a little bit isolated."
4,"During the winter, I never come here, since it's not really on my way to anywhere and I guess has not really looked so appealing form the outside.But we came here on an impromptu sunny evening and it was really good. Now the warm evenings have arrived, there aren't many better places to while away an evening with friends on the Fleet Insel. Because it gets so busy in this area a lot of the other places seem rushed, too busy and more than a little unfriendly.We had very friendly service from our waitress who spoke English and German without a fuss and they let us stay for as long as we wanted even after they should have closed and gone home. We even were able to enjoy the piano player from the next door Steigenberger Hotel terrace!Very nice, great fun, good chilli and beer. If you are passing, on a nice sunny day or evening, it's highly recommended."
4,"I've been to this place when I visited Germany.I've tried couple of other Indian restaurants but shikara is no match with those..I loved the food here, it's fresh and tasty, ambience is great and service is excellent Feel free to ask chef or manager about the daily specials or what suits your taste."
4,"Very cool little pizzeria just off the Reeperbahn in St. Pauli.  Order at the counter, then find a place to sit.  Don't be surprised if you end up sharing a table - they only have a few large tables and a few chairs at the counter.  Thin crust, good toppings, and a good selection of beers."
0,Food and drinks are small and we encountered the RUDEST waitress on the planet. Don't waste your time or money
4,We went last night while on a visit to Hamburg.  It is off the beaten path but worth the walk.  Our 82 mother on a birthday trip requested traditional German food particularly specials of the Hamburg area.  Thamers did not disappoint.  We all started with beer (of course) and she ordered up the Krabben.  I ordered blackfisch and big guy wanted Wienersnitzel as we generally only have it when we are visiting Germany.  We fancy ourselves bratkartoffeln snobs as we have had excellent and not so good.  Thämer's was some of the best. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend.
4,All the tourists that visit Hamburg have to see the Rathaus (town hall) of Hamburg. It was build 1897 out of granite and sandstone. The roof is made out of copper. Just go in the city center of Hamburg and you will see the magnificent building. Secret hint: Between the windows you can see the 20 kings of the old German empire. Another hint: Find within the inner yard the fountain Hygieia-Brunnen that was made in memory of the victory against the cholera epidemic in 1892.
1,"Extremely dissapointing. We went there for a casual family dinner in the winter of 2016. The location is nice-harbour view. I am pretty sure that in summer, the restaurant will be a great attraction. The staff is very polite, atmosphere is neat, clean and stylish. However the food was not that great. Firstly, they gave some fresh warm bread with a tomato sauce, which was delicious. But then, the starter-Bouillabaisse was bland. No proper seasoning, taste, it was too watery. For entry, I ordered turbot wrapped in bacon and risotto. Risotto was well done, but the fish was raw, it was probably frozen. The vegetables next to it was just way too bitter and overcooked. I do not know why the vegetables turned out greyish brown, but there was way too much lemon and/or ginger that made it too bitter I think. I did not order any dessert, however I did tasted my mom's dish, which was creme brulee and white chocolate mousse. There was nothing special with the mousse. I wish they put some liquor to make it more interesting. The creme brulee was way too hard. The top must crack as soon as you hit it lightly with your spoon but we had to use some force. The taste of the dessert was alright, but in my opinion not being able to cook soup, fish, vegetables, creme brulee is simply dissapointing for this restaurant.In conclusion, I would only go to this place in summer, to drink wine or beer, to enjoy the view. I would not pay for the food."
4,"This café exceeded my expectations! The café was great, comfy, loud and people were enjoying the vibe and atmosphere the café gives.I went there with my friends and drank something after a long day at work while the other one is busy with studies and needs a breather.I recommend it highly. Please, make a reservation to go there, because we needed to wait for quite some time, but then we asked if we could sit at the bar. We wanted to drink and not to eat, so we couldn't care less if we sit at the table or the bar next to the barkeepers.Best decision ever! We felt the rock-vibe much more than we once felt at a normal table.I don't understand why people are complaining, but that may be because we went there in the late evening (around 21 o'clock) and got the full blast of hard rock or just plain rock. I don't see why people are offended by the music.And the people at the tables should be more realistic ... they do have two floors and only have a limited amount of staff. Naturally, people won't get beer as fast as the speed of light. I had no problems when I went there once when they just opened or just sit at the bar. I've got great service back then and even last week.I'd say that people are at fault for coming in busy times or days. Especially on the weekend, people tend to go there, because the Kiez isn't far from there. So, head up! It's worth it.And I do think the prices are reasonable ..."
3,"Concept of this place is great and design too.It made like real apartment, if a real apartment was with table football,bar and filled with sofas:D +they have literature and live music evenings every first and third wednesday.-Not so special drink menu.Also once my glass of wine was filled from 3 bottle leftoversphe:( Thats why only 4 stars.Otherwise this place is great."
4,"Can't tell if the people here are French German or German French! The whole restaurant feel very authentic with a fun sailor vibe. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it seems-aside from the tables in the back there is an upstairs and a patio that they open when there's nice weather. The menu is really extensive and it was hard to decide what to order!We ordered table cider, the savory crepe with the poached pear and the chefs special, which was a crepe with a specialty sausage, mushrooms and salad.The table cider came in a cute mug and was delicious. The pear!!! Was!!! Spectacular!!!! The savory sweet flavors really hit the spot. This was a second dinner of sorts so if we hadn't been so full, we would have ordered a sweet crepe. I just admired from afar!!"
3,"The name of this restaurant is fitting for my wife and I as we have ""desired"" to dine here for quite some time. Still we wonder sometimes what took us so long. If you've walked along Gertigstrasse at any point on a beautiful and warm evening you will notice that Deseo is one of two very popular tapas restaurants that are always seemingly buzzing. The vibe here is definitely more upscale than Arcada, just a half block down, and it's also reflected in the prices. The food here is very good though and very much worth a go.A reservation almost seems mandatory when dining on the weekend, and I would highly recommend it. Having made our reservation just a couple days prior, my wife and I studied and salivated over the menu, pretty much knowing exactly what we'd order once we arrived. We started off with complimentary bread, aoili and olives, which all of were great. We then proceeded to order the pimientos de Padrón, goat cheese with potatoes, chorizo, bacon-wrapped dates, prawns in garlic oil, and calamari in garlic oil. Every dish we had was savory and delicious; ones that I would definitely order again.Service was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice here as my wife and I indulged on our ""desired"" dishes and observed life passing from our window-bar seating."
4,"Love this place!!! Amazing Turkish coffee and fantastic selection of Turkish sweets , baked goods and puddings. Yum!!"
3,"A great find! It's a small cozy place on a nice street. Really warm on a cold snowy night. They have 3 options for vegan spätzle which I was really craving. They recommended the ""cheese"" and onion one as the most traditional and I got it with smoked tofu as an option. It starts with a small side salad but then when the spätzle came out it was huge! It comes in a glass baking dish straight from the oven. The vegan ""cheese"" was really creamy. It was a bit of a struggle to finish it but it was so good! The staff were really friendly with perfect English. I'll definitely head back when I'm in Hamburg."
2,"It's expensive for the quality they are offering but I guess you have to pay also for the location. The wine was nice but the food quite tasteless. We just ordered a mozzarella salat for the two of us and well, it was cute and ok but not at al for two persons. It is a fine restaurant if you want mostly enjoy the location."
4,Lot of ppl waiting to get in. Got a seat after 20min without a reservation. The food was great and well priced. Liked the Red sake mojito!
3,"Dubara is apparently ""the best kebab shop in Hamburg"". This is more of a folk-lore thing amongst my friends then an official claim, but of course, I had to test this theory out. OK - I have to be honest here, due to the baffling popularity of doner in continental europe, you're never going to get quite a good a kebab in France/Germany/Holland etc. as you will down the curry mile in Caspian's, Manchester (check out the reviews!!), but this place isn't bad at all. They do a special with coated nan with some sort of pizza sauce, all wrapped cylindrically, so you can eat it length-ways. This is important as any kebab-lover can attest. This monster will set you back EUR 3.70, although there are cheaper options, including a kebab with chips actually in it. I must try this. They also sell beer as everywhere here, and the staff are funny, so give it a go."
3,"Very nice experience!  The food was surprisingly fresh tasting for a chain.  The salad was good, I highly recommend when getting a sandwich or a soup (as I did) adding the salad for and extra euro.  Everything can be taken to go!  Something I have noticed becoming the ""new trend"" in gastronomy in Hamburg.  I can remember when even coffee was never served in a togo cup!Dean & David was great! Nice location and decor.  Free Wifi if you are looking for a nice place to get some work done!Check it out!"
3,"I really like the Irish Rover. It always makes me feel at home, being a traditional Irish set up, complete with live music on Sunday's as well. They recently introduced a lunch menu! It's a bit sparse so I've only ordered the fish and chips during the two times that I've been in since this addition. It's a huge plate. Definitely the largest piece of fish I've ever gotten in a fish and chips meal and tons of fries.During the evening, they have a feta dip on their menu that is outta this world good. I always ask for no olives and they're happy to do so.On the weekends, they have a full Irish breakfast available for brunch. So yummy and kid friendly. They have a high chair! I've been bringing the wee one with me since he was about 5 mo old, both for brunch and for dinner. I guess you're not truly Irish unless you've brought the babe to a bar.The cooking is great, the beer is delicious, the people are friendly and those will all have me coming back again :-)"
1,"We had the Lachs Waffel with the beetroot dip. It sounded good on the menu, but when it was served it was actually just a big waffel with a few pieces of smoked Lachs lying on top of it. Also the taste of the waffel was odd and the whole thing just didn't taste good. In addition, 6-7 euros is quite pricey for this type of dish. Overall the food was pretty disappointing, so I wouldn't recommend going there."
4,"Love it - possibly in the top 5 of all German restaurants I have ever been to. warm atmosphere, a friendly and fast service, typical French meals, excellent quality and very tasteful food! All that for a price that is easily affordable (33€ the 3 course menu)."
4,"Tasty food. I've been in Europe for 2 months and this was my first burger since being here... I was very pleased! I had the BBQ burger and I would definitely recommend it! I got the menu, which ended up being a bit too much food for me, but it was worth the price."
3,"The food is basically very good. Nothing fancy. If you like Vietnamese style dishes this is pretty nice. If you are a fanatic about Vietnamese foods this will probably fall a little short. That said, I would happily return and enjoy a different selection. Nice folks. There is outside seating today (oct 2, 2015---it was a beautiful Friday in Hamburg)"
3,"I really like this patisserie. The owner bakes everything himself and the pastries taste absolutely fantastic and also look good. I really like the atmosphere in this little retro café: simple but cosy :) You can also get a typical German breakfast for 6,90 euros (worth mentioning that all you can drink coffee is included in the price)! Service is friendly and they have papers you can read whilst chillaxing away. The location is quite possibly the only annoying thing because you do not usually come past this place unless you know where it is. Then again this is not necessarily a bad thing, they always have customers inside so I presume the locals know this place well and keep it a well preserved little secret"
3,"I went there based on the numerous positive suggestions. It is in the basement of the building on a pretty little street. I had called in with a reservation request and they promised me that a table would be open. But once I got there, still had to wait 10 minutes to sit down, which was a bit of a bummer. I ordered a Salmon, Spinach and Tomato savory crepe. It took a while to get but it was very delish. The salmon was a bit salty but very flavorful. I went for a sweet crepe (sugar and lime) and that was even better than the savory option.My recommendation is for you to stick to the sweet options if you decide to check it out. They are far superior and just as good as the ones you get on the streets of the City of Lights."
2,"Nice and warm and filled with manily uni students this is a great little place for lunch as it's near the Uni, cheap, fast and effective. Their soup and bread is yummy, filling and a bargin. There's plenty of other things on the menu if soup isn't your thing, pizza, bagels, pasta etc... the coffee is drinkable too."
4,"I really enjoy my lunches here. Ti Breizh is a traditional Bretonian eatery, complete with striped shirts and maritime decor, which serves nothing much else other than Galettes and Crepes. The menu is very diverse, ranging from light Galettes (with cheese and egg) to the heavier ones (various sausage-type toppings), and for dessert there's a scroll-long list of every type of crepe combination imaginable. Brown sugar, maple syrup, chocolate, ice cream, whipped cream, apple sauce - if you can think it, Ti Breizh make it. Granted, this is probably not the best place to go with a large party, as the kitchen is only capable of making 4 galettes/crepes at a time and it will take the food a little longer to arrive to a big table, and the prices aren't the cheapest in the area. You can, however, get an affordable lunch menu if you arrive at lunchtime and the combinations on the lunch menu are normally diverse enough to include something for everyone - including a cider or a cup of coffee. Very recommended!"
4,"Very flavorful kebab and rice! The soultani is well cooked, overall well done but still very moist. Served with mint and onions, as well as flatbread. Very reasonably priced about 14.50 euros for soultani, about 2.80 for each drink. Served very fast! Good Persian music playing in the background and elegantly decorated."
3,"Indian Food in HH for the first time. The first impression wasn't very good. The spot looks a little bit dirty, empty to-go boxes lying everywhere trash bins overfilled, but the inside smells great though. We ordered two different chicken dishes and we were positively surprised. The food is really tasty and prepared very fast. I would give 5 stars if the place was cleaner and not so chaotic."
4,I was not impressed by the name and other reviews of this place but we were looking for sushi on a Sunday and it was a bit challenging. So we followed our gut feeling and came here for nigiri and sashimi. I have to say I was very surprised. Fresh fish!!! Service was great. We ordered a chief's choice for 2 plate and we liked what we had. Comes with miso soup for start. Also bathroom is nice and neat. Will definitely come back.
2,"This used to be a five star place. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have taken a dive. Service is fast and it's so busy you have to fight for a seat. This hasn't changed. These are the reasons I'm disappointed: 1.) My favorite items, the salad and the sandwhich with thinly sliced filet has been discontinued. Only variations of burger patty are available now. 2.) They ran out of carbonation for their fountain drinks. They offered a bottle of Fritz Cola instead, but didn't have any in diet. 3.) I ordered a salad with balsamic vinegar and got one with French dressing. 4.) They remade my salad and it tasted like both balsamic and French dressing combined. Was the mixing bowl clean? 5.) It used to be that their salads used the finer parts of the leaves. My salad tonight consisted of at least 50% white parts, the tough and tasteless sections of the lettuce leaf near the stem. I ended up eating less than half of my salad. Even my husband who happily gobbles up my plate and his took just a few bites and gave up. Honestly, with the filet strips no longer on the menu, I have no reason to return to this Jim Block or any other Jim Block."
4,"We were visiting Hamburg for the day and found this coffee shop / cafe on Yelp. What a find!  It reminded me of the fabulous shops in San Francisco. Great hip, minimalist decor. The coffee and food was amazing!  I had a latte that was delicious and hit the spot since we were exploring in the rain. Their breakfast menu was small but fabulous. The staff was helpful and spoke English...yay. We ordered 3 different things--waffle with fruit and mascarpone (so good), poached eggs with avocado, and scrambled eggs with a delish cheese spread for toasted bread.  Everything was fabulous!  Definitely worth a stop!"
3,"Great French pastries and good coffee as well! Nice tortellettes and eclairs. Friendly service. Has cute French photos decorating the walls. Is unfortunately a bit too small for my taste (also no toilet)  there were only 2 tables inside, making it more of a Stehcafé where you can stop for a quick yummy French treat. Wish they could expand so you could really enjoy sitting there for a while!Recommended for a short stop in Paris!"
4,"As everyone knows...I'm addicted to great coffee!! And this is the place to find it. At first I was worried that it was a tourist coffee company and I was happily wrong. The coffee is super strong and fantastic. I was in town with my husband visting a friend and we came here multiple times during our visit. Almost filled the entire stamp card. And I'm also a sucker for a stamp card. I definitely enjoy the cafe itself as well. It's very modern and plenty of space. The service is very friendly. The waitress insisted that I sit down and that I could pay later. The culture in Europe is definitely to not be rushed and sit an enjoy the break in the day. Also who can't be in love with the ""Deathspresso"" icon and slogan!! ""Schlafen kannste du wann du tot bist"", ""You can sleep when you're dead!""Wach auf Hamburg!!"
4,"I was in a rush and wanted to grab a quick takeaway for the train. The staff here was professional and helpful (in both English and German), and my Pho was done in 5 minutes! Everything nicely packed, very tasty, and proportion was perfect for the containers. Can't wait to eat in next time!"
3,"Spacious, and has leash free dog areas - always fun.  Both shady and sunny areas - I take my dog there almost every Sunday."
0,"Burgers are ok. Cheesecake is good.Gave it a second chance to make up for the 1st time... But...Service is still HORRIBLE. 30 minutes in between even seeing a server. Bartenders running food. No method to the madness. This place is understaffed, over sat and mismanaged. 2.5 full hours from seating till payment of check for a BURGER. that's insanity.I won't be back to endure another waste of an evening"
4,"All this time I thought the bratwurst I had back home was delicious...not even close to what I had here in Germany. The real stuff is amazing! They don't serve it like a hot dog either, just a roll on the side and it is juicy and tasty. I'm gonna need another one before I leave. Soooooooo good!"
3,"Wow, talk about cheap and plentiful food. I came close to the end of lunch time when most of the food was sold out! I ordered the fish of the day. They were out of potatoes and asked if pasta was OK. I was given a HEAPING plate of fish and spaghetti (like the entire box).  The fish was covered in a delicious, savory yellow sauce (the color of hollandaise but tasted different - better). There is no English menu but the host and chef were very sweet and accommodating. There is limited seating inside but plenty of outside seating. Highly highly recommend! My second best meal in Hamburg."
3,"It seemed only fitting, being Australian and all, to go to the 'Down Under' bar to watch Deutschland Vs Australia in the Football. I must admit, I was a little scared. I was anticipating a horribly tacky, over-done museum of typical Aussie icons plastered on the walls with a sound track of Steve Urwin saying ""Crikey"" over and over in the background. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that although there were typical Aussie icons present like digeridoos and kangaroo signs, it didn't feel over done. It didn't feel like 'home' but it felt good. I think the menu was comical rather than accurate...I don't actually think in reality there are too many typical Australian dishes. But they did a great job to have kangaroo on the menu. Please eat them- they are a pest! I had a chicken burger that came in a baguette. Once again, I don't know how Australian that is but who cares? It tasted good! We had friendly service from the bar staff and waitresses which IS typically Australian and to me, more important. It was a great atmosphere to watch the game in. Australians and Germans together got to witness the thrashing. All in all, a great night."
3,"I love spending time at this little coffee shop and vegan restaurant because of the hipster vibe, very cool decor, and great music. There's a counter in the back where you order and then some couches and tables in the main room where you sit to eat or drink coffee. The coffee is decent (not amazing but better than average). In terms of food, I've only had a tofu wrap and a cookie, which were both pretty decent. If you're here, be sure to check out the art area right behind the restaurant called Gängeviertel; it's one of the coolest parts of the city."
3,"Another fabulous beach bar in Hamburg!Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and lots of tropical kitsch!This has more recliners than most other bars, unfortunately it also fills up quite quickly. The drinks at Del Mar are great, you have fantastic views over the harbour and can just sit back and relax and watch the ships go by. If you've never been to a beach bar or just need to relax after a long day, check out this spot!"
3,"When I'm hungry and I'm in the Reeperbahn area this is my favourite spot to get some fast food. Their Pide is really tasty, I'd definitely recommend it and they make it right in front of you. I've never been bothered to try anything else apart from it though , but they've got even Kebap here."
1,"Had a quick diner here with some colleagues during a work visit to Hamburg. It was on a Saturday and very early (before 19:00) so not at all busy though several table had already been reserved. I had the veal Wiener schnitzel. As schnitzels go a Wiener Veal is my absolute favourite. I didn't like the one the served me that evening. It was way to thin and very dry. For all I know it could have been last night's left over, that's how bad it tasted. Also didn't like the fact that they charge extra for the Preiselbeeren. If ever I would visit this place again I would not have the Wiener Veal Schnitzel again!"
3,"Enjoyed an excellent mid week lunch here. Helped by a bright spring day, it felt great to be down by the water in this large, open modern restaurant. The whole feeling was of space and light. We were happy to take the recommended specials - great sushi to start with, followed by a main fish course. I then indulged in ice cream, deep fried! The service was friendly but unobtrusive. Great place for business lunches."
3,"Really nice new-ish place on the catwalk that is Schuterblatt, hence, a bloody good venue from which to enjoy a cold Augustinabrau. The signs on the toilet doors to indicate the correct genders permitted are not to be missed!"
4,"This is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant! As we walked in we were already so glad to be there. The interior design is so pleasing - both calm and hip. It would be a great place to bring a big group to. Clean lines mostly white, accented with dark wood tables and yellow cushioned benches gave it an snappy touch. There are only about 10 main dishes on the menu which is in my opinion a good sign. Everything tastes fresh. My friend and I ordered two different things and shared. The veggies were crisp and the meat perfectly prepared - the beef was tender and the chicken and pork were crisply grilled. I thought the offer was cleverly assembled, offering a variety in just one dish. For example: the grilled combination of pork, shrimp and egg roll on vermiccelli. It is located about 10 min. walking distance from Central Station or directly at U-Lohmuehlenstrasse. The price per plate is around 6-8 Euros. I suggest trying the Vietnamese beer, Saigon, made from rice. It was really good - kind of like Sake. They offer cocktails as well and of course tea."
3,"Cute place for a brunch in summer.Outdoor seatings however arent the most comfortable. The crowd is made of families, groups of friends, couples, business meetings. The brunch buffet doesn't offer a very wide choice, however it has the basics: cheese, salami, bread, eggs, müsli .."
4,"Most delicious tapas. Had a birthday dinner here and I have never had more mussels for 9€. We almost couldn't finish them, but we did. Totally recommend, the house wine is so easy to drink. Love this place!"
4,"Kardelen must be doing something right to have a line out the door at lunch every day of the week. And I think it's a great place for casual Turkish food, too, but I have to admit that I'm a little puzzled about why it's so popular. The menu is incredibly long. This is mostly because they serve a handful of foods (Döner meat, falafel, veggies, various casseroles) in various formats (plates, wraps, sandwiches), and every single permutation is on the menu.The food itself is really good, and everything is prepared at the moment you order it, so you can customize as you like with sauces and other special requests. I usually get a Döner in bread or in a wrap (durum), but the other dishes look great, too. As mentioned, there is always a huge line. However, they are good at moving orders quickly, and even getting a seat in the packed dining room isn't all that hard. I do wish they were less popular and had more space/capacity, but that's just part of the Kardelen experience."
3,"I ordered vegetarian pizza without cheese. It was good, but not heavenly good. I would prefer less tomato sources and more olive oil. But vegan pizzas are not easy to handle. Pizza was served in a shape of heart with really beautiful arrangement of seasonal vegetables on top. Extra points for this. I like a little crazy vibe of the place a lot, cooks   flirting and guests singing together, amazing place for weekend dinner!"
3,"A very cool place in Hamburg Schanze. The burgers are excellent (150g patties). We came free to eat at 19:30 and had a small choice of tables, the place was fully booked. The potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent side order the the fantastic burger (No choice of a bun but that is okay for me).Only thing is when you go downstairs to visit the toilet you must know that is an old house. Nothing more to say."
3,"Service was ok  butt the food had great taste and culture its always packedBlond waiter who wiped our table with his hand and told us ""thats how it is in here""Youre awesome keep it like that"
3,"Better than the average British indie night. Ended up here, en route to the Schanze, and stayed all night. EUR4 entry and EUR2.50 for a bottle of lager is pretty reasonable for a Saturday and the music was the same clichéd bands you'd hear in the UK: Oasis, Blur, Joy Division but with more variety- eg instead of playing Love will tear us apart they played Disorder. Not recommended if you want something quentissentially Hamburg, but a good safe bet."
3,"Almost one of ""must-visits"" in HH due to very central location, nice schnitzels and great beer."
4,"Ich kenne den Laden bestimmt schon seit 25 Jahren, mit meinem Mann bin ich zum Stammkunden geworden, als wir in der Nähe wohnten. Leider ist das nicht mehr der Fall, aber zu bestimmten Gelegenheiten ist ein dinner im 'la Pergola' zur Tradition für und geworden.Großartig die fluffigen weichen Brötchen mit Basilikumpesto, die als Gruß aus der Küche kommen. Man muß aufpassen, daß man sich daran nicht schon satt isst.Ansonsten: toller Service, leckeres Essen, moderate Preise, kuschelige Atmoshäre, ich persönlich liebe das Lammfilet mit Dijon Senf Sauce, und für uns beide ist die Rindercarpaccio mit reichlich frischen Champignons, Parmesan und Rucola oder das Vitello Tonnato ein Muß.Reservierung ist ratsam, die Plätze am Rand sind gemütlicher als in der Mitte und immer schnell voll."
2,"The sitting-on-the-floor option is a novelty thing and fun - for the first five minutes. afterwards you get a bit cramped. there's hardly any space and if you go with more than 4 people, conversation tends to get lost in curry fumes. Yet my friends never seem to get tired of it and always drag me into this place.The food is ok. Even though the menu offers plenty of dishes they tend to taste similar. Some of the dishes are served quite cold so ask if you're unsure. Also stay away from the lassis unless you like sweets with your main course.the service is a bit grumpy and not very talkative. still, it's ok+ food at an ok price at a great location!"
4,Super toller Strand!
4,"Beautiful cafe in a quiet place in Eimsbuettel,always offering very fresh and delicious food, be it a breakfast or lunch or just coffee&cake. Very customer oriented service, good prices, fine decore in a country style.Tables in a front room (there is another room at the back) are very densly packed, so be warned  your neighbour will hear every detail of your conversation! If it's completely full, most likely during lunch time, expect lots of table and chair shuffling to let customers to get in or out. Have to say it, the place is lovely anyway and worth visiting!"
4,"I've had the Miniatur Wunderland as a bookmark for close to ten years. I made the specific trip to Hamburg to visit it today. And it was totally worth it. Absolutely incredible, it exceeded my expectations.Picture a table-top miniature train set. Now expand it to the size of a warehouse. On two floors. And add hundreds of trains, thousands of vehicles, millions of little people. Everywhere you look, there's some interesting little detail. I spotted a dozen monks working on repairing the Popemobile. A guy operating a jackhammer that would bounce around. Two people hiding on a roof that were fighting.The cars stop at lights. They even have their turn signals blinking before the light turns green and they head off on whatever mission they're programmed for.The airport? Absolutely beyond anything you can imagine. The planes take off and land. They taxi up to gates. The mini jetbridge pops out! The ground crew vehicles all follow the proper procedures for driving around the airport. They even have a fire brigade that leaves the firehouse to follow inbound trains.Tips: Get there as early as you can because it does get crowded. Make sure your phone is charged as you're going to want to take a million pictures and a ton of video. They do have a free wifi.This was one of the highlights of my week-long trip to Europe.[Review 12057 overall, 1840 of 2019.]"
3,"This is a newly opened Indian restaurant in the Hallerstrasse. It's nicely decorated and the staff is very attentive. They also have a large selection of vegetarian dishes at good prices. My Tarka Dal was delicious and at a reasonable price. Only the service was not particularly fast, so make sure you have some time when you visit."
0,"Currywurst ohne Pommes? 5,90 Euro für eine größere Wurst? Kein vernünftiges Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis."
0,"What to expect from a copy of  world-famous tourist trap. Being from Bavaria myself and loving Bavarian food  this is one of the few places in Hamburg to get some. We went to get ""schweinshaxe"", a classic. (Grilled pork shank). First, instead of the typical bread dumplings, it comes with potato dumplings, ok, small issue. But the true dissappointment was the Haxe itself. It was dry and the crust (the best part) was hard as a stone. My feeling is they had put too many on the grill and just warmed up the leftover ones from yesterday, poured the fat over it and sold it as fresh. My mother in law had the pork roast, which had no crust whatsoever and was dry as well. These people are ruining the reputation of Bavarian food! its a Tourist trap. You want the real deal? Go to Munich, at least its the original trap. To be fair, I had a decent Haxe before, at the Speersort -branch of the Hofbräuhaus. But there the waitress was so unfriendly that I did not want to go again. Bad choice, obviously. I'd rather handle grumpy waitresses than bad food. I really hope for them it was just a bad day."
2,Das Essen hier ist wirklich lecker. Pakistanisch und Indisch sind nicht besonders unterschiedlich. Beim Mittagstisch gebennsie sich allerdings nicht die allergrößte Mühe. Schmeckt trotzdem immernoch gut. Die Bedienung ist mal so mal so. Gehe hier aber dennoch gern hin.
3,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Joh Albrecht. Been there several times. If I have friends visiting Hamburg, it is probably the place I take them to. They got a good view of the canal if you are lucking getting a table next to the window. They have really good Flammkuchen. I've ordered it every time I got there. I've tried schweinshaxe and schnitzel once or twice. Not impressive. Beer is good though. The place is good for group. They have a lot of long tables."
3,"I went there for lunch. The food tastes good and the service is lightning fast. The saladbar was fresh, but they could have given us a broader sortiment to chose from.Overall: Good place for a quick meal."
3,"This place deserves the name, burger+lieblich, burger with love. Although burger always gives impression of chain fast food, you realize they are more than that after having it at Burgerlich. Really a cool place to hang out with friend and be a ""Hamburger"""
3,"Strong cocktails, we loved them. We ordered mai thai and the mystery mojito. Nice ambiance in an early Sunday morning, after a stroll on the harbor. Too bad the terrace is still closed. Staff could be more energetic, but the good cocktails make up for it."
1,"Definitely overrated here on Qype. We had reserved at Taparia and they screwed up our reservation. Will next be docking their review on here but Casa del Sabor comes first. Right off the bat, I want to say we received very polite service. Place was packed and the young waitress did her best to get us a table. All is well at this point. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. First off, the food is mediocre. We had tapas primarily and had ordered six different plates. Each and every one of these was bland if not downright bad. The turkey with ""devil sauce"" (whatever that is) was horrible. The chorizo with white beans was also disappointing. The meatballs in tomato sauce we also just bland. The other plates.....completely forgettable. Worse than the food was the house wine. I am convinced it was watered down. Either it was a horrible 2 Euro bottle from Aldi or some other discounter or they added water to ""stretch"" it. One way or another, bad. Anyway, too bad that the food just doesn't work here. It seems genuinely Portuguese and could be a great little place to come for good food. Unfortunately, they've long ago stopped focussing on quality food and just rip off tourists at this point. In this part of town you'll fill your restaurant without even trying. Shame, since our waitresses were so polite. (Maybe they actually listened to the few poor reviews on here from others about service. I'll cross my fingers that they do the same with the food.)"
3,With its glorious trees and other greenery the outside spaces here are a great place to sit out in during the day doing a bit of people watching or just listening to the wind through the branches.Internally it's comfortable & inviting with decent service and the ostrich wrap and goats cheese salad make for a great sharing combination.
3,"If you're in Ottensen at 5am and want to go to a lively bar, well, you don't have many choices. Familien Eck would be one though. Maybe one of the reasons is that it's pretty tiny, so it doesn't need that many people to be lively :) It's basically a dive bar, and a fair percentage of the crowd will probably be quite alternative/punky looking. Everyone is nice though, and the drinks are a reasonable price. One noteworthy thing is that to save space they have the DJ working almost on the ceiling! It's hard to describe, so you'll just have to see for yourself."
4,"A friend of mine brought my mom and I to Plat du Jour for lunch.  It was so cute and French, packed with businessmen and women for lunch.  What a spot to truly enjoy well made food with a lovely ambience.  I had to go back, so I brought my boyfriend and his sister one afternoon.  We each ordered the steak because it sounded and was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant forLunch with friendsLunch with business partners"
0,"After a great experience the previous night at the excellent Hof Brauhaus we decided to give this place a try on Saturday night as it was just around the corner from my Mums hotel. I'd had lunch there before and thought it might be just the thing.What a huge disappointment! The service was friendly and helpful, but of the three main dishes we ordered were all well below par. The Wiener Schnitzel was burnt, my pork medallions were over cooked, the baked potato with chicken was likewise incinerated.I would never return there sad because it's in a great position!Beer lovers note: Although this place bills itself as a brewery, there seems little evidence of this taking place, although there are copper tanks in evidence. I tried a Dunkle and was very unimpressed."
4,"What an amazing experience, it was made more interesting due to the language barrier for me. Friendly staff and the menu kept me guessing. Once the friendly guide knew I was Australian he made an extra effort to translate most things for me which I really appreciated. I booked online from Australia and the customer service was top notch. All my questions and queries were answered promptly. I went by myself and wouldn't recommend it unless you can speak German as unless you are lucky like I was tonight you will struggle knowing what's happening."
4,"I great place to chill out in Niendorf. Whether you need to walk your dog, run, cycle or just sit on a bench this place is perfect. Lots of shaded paths make it nice and cool in summer. There's a playground for kids, barbeque areas and even a deer sanctuary. Waldcafe Corell is a really good place to stop off and get a snack too.I'm lucky enough to live 5 mins walk away from this place and I'm going to make sure I take advantage of it more in the future."
4,Possibly the most beautiful building in Hamburg. It still impresses me after many years in Hamburg and I'm always finding out new things about it.
4,"Who would've thought a place named the bird actually is well known for its burgers and who would've thought that I actually could find one of the best burgers I've had (and I've tried a lot) in Hamburg? Ok maybe I should've seen that one coming. So my friend tells me about this great burger spot and while I agree to go I'm thinking how good could this burger actually be, I guess this is a perfect example of what they say about not having expectations because I absolutely loved it! When we first arrived there was no seating inside except for the bar and that's where we sat, First of all they had ""angry hour"" which had all kinds of specials but being that it was a Sunday night I didn't think they would honor it but they were willing to, the one that caught my eye was the buy one tap beer and get one free per person at the bar, it was set to be over at 20:00 and it was 19:45 and the bartender told me that if I could finish my first beer by 20:00 that I could have the other one free, while I didn't go through with it, it was still nice that they would do it, now on to the burger, it comes with fries and they have many different kinds, you can also make your own burger if you wish, the burger came with fries and was huge and impossible to eat without getting some all over your hands but those are the best ones right? I finished the burger but it was no easy task, good quality good prices also"
2,"Turmbar is certainly unique. It's a little bar in an old water tower (?) thing. Walking to the bar seemingly takes forever, going round and round in circles. At the top there is a little bar that serves most of what you'd expect. The main problem is the slight lack of windows!"
3,Lieblings is located close to Reeperbahn. It has a variety of ice cream flavors. The ones I tried were all really good. Great place to stop by when visiting St. Pauli.
4,"(This review is best read in black and white while listening to smooth jazz.)It's like walking into a cliché!Just like there's a moment of eye-pain when you open the blinds a sunny day, there's gonna be a moment of awkwardness when you walk through the door into the super romantic ambience. Just power through. Make joke about it if necessary. Just power through.It's a place designed to get you into a warm fuzzy haze of happiness.Didn't like the chairs though. They're big and bulky, there's too many of them, and I don't like to perform self-origami just to sit down."
4,"wow, mein Premier vom Afghanischen Essen, hier am Sonntag Mittag am Steindamm. lecker! alles frisch. Jasmintee mit Teeblätter & Jasminblüten.SEHR zu Empfehlen! Probiere es mal aus, und geniese diese tolle Cuisine. Bon Appetit!"
4,Walking in the door the delicious smell of brewing beer. Chicken spinach curry was today's special for 7 Euros. Messing beer also delicious and reasonable.
0,"Been there once due to the many recommendations and was really dissappointed. Bad service: slow, uncoordinated, sloppyFood was average at its best I have to admit that we were a crowd of 12 people which is always a little tricky for the chef - but we ordered a table in advance - therefore it should not have been a surprise. Overall: Not worth the trip to Wandsbek at all."
4,One of the best doner durums I've eaten. And 3.5 Euro is a good price.
4,"It feels a little odd - writing a review about a bridge, but this bridge is no ordinary bridge. The Köhlbrandbrücke is a 3.5km long steel monster which leads from one part of the harbor to another. The bridge is perfect for a sightseeing tour. Accessible only to vehicles (no bicycles or pedestrians allowed on the bridge) driving over the Köhlbrandbrücke gives you an amazing view of Hamburg's harbor and a glimpse of the sheer size of the harbor district. The view from the Köhlbrandbrücke by day is a must-see for both tourists and residents interested in seeing more of Europe's 2nd largest harbor."
0,"I'm a native Californian.  I know Mexican food well. Sometimes I like it authentic. Sometimes I like it Americanized.  Being a native Californian it is likely I will eat Mexican food or a Mexican-inspired dish for at least one meal a day.  Which is why when I travel I find myself in Mexican restaurants in places like Germany or Scotland. I usually approach these places knowing that they will be pale comparisons to what I can get back home.  And it was with that in mind that I went to Jim Burrito. So when I say it was literally the worst burrito I've ever had, keep in mind that I wasn't expecting it to be as good as something from back home. What was so bad?  I got the Poblano covered burrito. The sauce tasted like dish soap. It was awful. The burrito's fillings were also very wet and lacking flavor. So basically I had a soupy soapy burrito.  The German friend I had with me tried a bite of my burrito after I refused to eat any more, and he also said it was awful.  As I looked around the place I noticed most people ordered the quesadillas. I'm sure that this much simpler recipe of cheese and a tortilla would have been a better choice, and should you find yourself dragged here by German friends, I recommend you keep it simple and order that.I think the most aggravating part of the meal though came when we went to pay.  We brought our dishes back to the counter, and in German the server/host treated us like we had offended him by not eating the awful burrito.  It was bad enough I had to pay for something inedible, but to be treated like we had offended them by not forcing ourselves to eat the awful meal, well that's just ridiculous.  I didn't make a scene, I didn't request the burrito be taken off the bill, instead I vowed silently to myself I'd write this review to warn other travelers away from this place."
2,"A nice restaurant, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The quality of the food was good and the meels were all typically german or austrian... But it was really not as elaborate as to justify the high prices."
3,"The ice cream shop ""Eiskantine"" offers a small choice of ice cream flavors. The flavors include very common flavors like vanilla and chocolate as well as special flavors like chocolate-mint. The ice cream tasted very good. The shop has its own interesting style and the staff is very nice."
4,The town hall of Hamburg is with his 647 rooms bigger than the Buckingham Palace.Some places of the town hall are only visitable through a guidance. Conclusion:The town hall of Hamburg is very historical and beautiful. It is a visit worth!
3,"Really good pizza. Too big to finish! Free Sambucha shots with the receipt, nice touch. Free bubbly while you wait for a table too. Watch out though, they pour you San Pelegrino water without asking, of you drink it, €5 added to your cheque. A very nice experience overall and a tasty lunch the next day ;)"
3,My first time in a vegan restaurant and I gotta say it was really delicious. As a vegetarian it was also nice to be able to just look at the menu and know that I can order anything I want without having to think about it because it's all-vegan! The restaurant is also really pretty and the people were very nice.
4,"This was the first time I had set foot on a previously operational submarine. The sub is parked up in an old industrial area on The Elbe, which is just the right setting to get you in the mood, nothing too glitzy for the old Russian sub. Inside the sub itself is really interesting, old Russian components, pipes everywhere and you get to 'see' what conditions on the sub would have been like. Plus during your journey through the sub you get to climb and crawl through the narrow doors of the sub.Then after the tour you can sit down with a nice mulled wine whilst thinking what it would be like serving on an active sub. I'd hate it, I'm far too tall, would have back problems after the first couple of days.... After the tour I had the urge to load up Red Alert 2 and take down some dolphins with my fleet of Russian subs..."
2,"Went here for lunch after hearing about it continuously from colleagues, who frequent this place for the schnitzel. Restaurant was basically empty at 12:30, we were served promptly and the food arrived in a timely manner. Unfortunately, my schnitzel was not significantly bigger than Chicken McNuggets. Honestly - for 6.50 you can get a decent sized schnitzel at several other places within a 500m radius from this restaurant. Besides the schnitzel, they have a dish of the day - my colleague's beef goulash looked really nice, so I'll surely come back here to try something other than the schnitzel. If you're in it for the meat n' crumbly, look elsewhere."
3,"Went once for the specialty/fusion sushi that is offered  awesome! So tasty and very creative. Fancy atmosphere, need to reserve in the evenings. More on the pricey side, but high-quality food."
4,"Best little falafel place on the 'schanze. Friendly staff, great value, and most importantly really tasty authentic falafel. Their Kimo Falafel is my own tip. Can get crowded in the smallish seating area but never feels uncomfortable."
2,"Of all the cities in Germany I've been to, the Hamburg Rathaus was probably the most structurally appealing that I've seen.Really just like any other city center though... lots of shops, stores, restaurants, busy area of town."
0,"After this place opened back in the days it was absolutely fantastic and showed great hospitality.The food came in good portions, was delicious and only high-quality ingredients were used.Unfortunately they cut back on almost everything. The food is just average, very boring and nothing special at all really.I guess the only thing I can do is remember the good old days..."
3,"Serves food til midnight every day of the week, including Sunday. Centrally located. Ordered 4 Dim Sum plates, two bowls of Hot and Sour soup and one plate of Chinese vegetables. My boyfriend had a beer. All for about 33 euros. Service was fast, friendly and the food came out quickly. The Dim Sum plates were fine. We got the steamed puns with pork, the pork and shrimp dlsteamed dumpling, fish balls and fried tofu. The only dish that was really great was the tofu. I wouldn't recommend the fish balls.The best part of the meal was the soup and the vegetables, but mostly the soup. It was a large portion and was the best version of Hot and Sour I've ever had. It's impressive when a place makes a classic exciting like that. And only for 2.60 euros a bowl. I'll be coming back here for a late night soup for sure."
2,"Nice food and great service, wasn't a fan of one of their dishes but that's just personal choice (I ordered two dishes just in case). Service was quick, friendly staff and the pizza sizes are massive."
4,Sehr coole Location !!
3,"Had a late lunch here with family after an appointment at UKE. Service was great and we ordered a biryani, baingan bharta and Punjabi paneer. All three items were very delicious. I will go there again on a special occasion."
2,"Can't claim to be from SoCal, but I know a good Burrito when I taste one and this steak burrito almost ticked the boxes. I was looking for taste and chilli zing and I got everything I was looking for. Would have liked to have seen some authentic sauces to add to the heat, but they use that Chinese Sriracha stuff, you know with the yellow stopper. No matter, it did the job well. Later discovered some Lol Tun Habanero sauce which I applied liberally.Thrash Metal on the stereo which didn't make for a restful experience, but hey, the Schanze is not made for rest even at 1pm! But the other mainly younger crowd seemed to be grooving to it! The guys who run this place are obviously big metal fans, one wall is covered with pics of men in gimp masks. Either that, or along with the hard seating, it's an effective device to keep the customers moving and discourage lingerers.If I was to be critical, I would highlight their steak cooking process, which seemed not be via a grill, more like  steamed steak! Were I to return, I'd choose another filling and perhaps take some earplugs along.Sorry but it has to be three stars."
4,"People had been telling me that this place does the best Turkish food in Hamburg for years  basically ever since I lived in Hamburg. Last Friday I finally remembered to check it out, and boy was I glad that I did! Two of us arrived at about 8pm on a Friday. There were already about 10 people waiting for tables, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The service was pleasant and quick, but it's worth noting that they do not serve any alcohol here. What they do serve is meat! Basically everything on the menu and everything that I saw being delivered to tables looked amazing. The kebab plate that I ordered (I forget the name, sadly) was huge and very tasty, but my companion's lamb kebab was even better. I will be back to try more of the menu, and I'll be bringing more friends!"
3,This is a very nice thai and sushi restaurant at the Lange Reihe close to the main station. The staff was kind and the food tasted good. The prices are okay. It was pretty crowded and we were lucky to get the last table. It is probably better to reserve a table in advance.  The entrance is even to the ground.
4,Best breakfast in the center of Hamburg.Try the self baked buns - best buns in town!The scrambled egg is very yummy and you should definitely try it out!
3,"Update:I'm here without dogs and babies, so my experience is different from other negative reviews I've read. I can see the appeal of this place: it lies in its well-designed, cozy, country-style atmosphere, in its warmth. December 29, 2012Darn! Nothing on their Facebook page says they would be closed for Christmas. :("
3,I had the vegan pancakes called Roxen. It was served with fruits and apple puree. The portion was really huge. Next to that I ordered a lactose free cappuccino with oat milk. I was only able to eat one of the twopancakes. The pancakes could be a little bit sweeter. The atmosphere is cozy and hip. The service was good and friendly.
4,"Everything is great about this restaurant. Great food, great service. Maybe i'd have wished for it to have a more open space, but on the other hand it makes it more authentic with actual ""parisien"" restaurants"
3,"When you are up for a brunch with a twist, that's the place to go. And the twist is middle eastern/mediterranean, yamm! Inside and outside, as previous posters wrote, it's nothing special. Probably pretty boring bar. But believe me, exciting brunch! Honestly, I'm tired of these endless pasta salads. Not in Chakra. Along with brunch classics like cheese and sussages, omlette, salmon, there are also baked aubergine, tabouleh, hummus and other spreads. Olives, fetta cheese, all sorts of antipasti are there too. It's reasonably priced and I have no complaints about service."
4,Best coffee I had in Hamburg. Great service and coffee knowledge. Good help finding a filter coffee to my taste. Very high quality coffee and nice people behind the counter.Also a good place to buy coffee beans and brewing equipment. Eg. filters brewers and syphons. Highly recommended!
3,"When in China, I learned that the quality of restaurants there does typically not correlate with its interior. So I wasn't worried that the ""Chinese am Fleet"" is located about as unpoetically as you can go in Hamburg, and oozes that cheap corner Chinese charme of decades lost. At the off time I visited, the only other customer was a Chinese-looking guy slurping his rice, which I took as a good omen as far as buy-in by the Chinese community at large.""Chinese am Fleet"" seems to cater to two kinds of customers: the lunch break crowd seeking hearty grub for 7€, and people craving authentic yet inexpensive Chinese dishes for a few more bucks (expect 12-16€ for most dishes). Second group, the first two pages in the menu are for you!There is much variety to choose from, with a spiciness warning for most of the authentic dishes. Portion sizes are very generous - obviously you'll have more fun as a group to share Chinese-style, otherwise this will likely be a very meat-focused experience. The pork belly dish I sampled tasted really good, rich and fatty as it should be, nicely seasoned.Don't worry too much about the spiciness warning - even at the highest rating, the food remains nicely edible. Thai nationals will still need to apply some extra chili.So - it's not the most authentic or best Chinese dining experience I had in Germany, but can more than hold its candle among Hamburg's everyday Chinese options."
2,"I was quite curious after all these great reviews!Unfortunately, underwhelmed by it myself.Let's start with the good: the servers are fun, the fish is fresh and cooked well, the location is 'typical Portuguese quarter' (but note that this means a view of parked cars and being surrounded by smoking people when seated outside).But the cooking was hit and miss; e.g. Tuna with a mint pesto - excellent, fruit sauce with white fish - awkward combination, steaks - completely overcooked; the order medium rare - get medium well kind of off the mark. The house wines we were recommended were not good at all, the white still being the best of the three. The red wine was served outright warm...Be prepared that the 4-course meal, 50€ plus drinks, will be very filling; they definitely don't skimp on portion sizes here."
3,"Id read about this secret suggestion on Qype before and desided to take my Dutch friends here on a sundayafternoon. Perfect opportunity considering everything is closed on Sunday and its just near to my house... Actually we wanted to go to the Hagenbeck Zoo, but it was already 3 oclock...And this museum is about animal watching as well...so why not?! This museum is fantastic! The bird section is extremely funny, escpecially the German names. Not that the German language is funny, but more the comparison with the Dutch bird names... The fact that all these animals arent real doesnt make it less entertaining..You can sit next to them, touch them (thats actually forbidden..), take some great photos and compare heights. Last but not least, you dont have to pay entrance, which allows you to just enjoy a short hour of fun and education about animals and the past. Great activity for young and old! And a good laugh..if you go there with some friends."
3,"I dont think starbucks need an introduction or a description.It's starbucks! For those who don't know starbucks (although i doubt there are many of you out there) Yes it is self service! However, I, personally come to starbucks for their cakes. Please do try the Cheese cake (either new york or with jam) or the carrot cake and then thank me for my suggestion :) Enjoy! - and keep a bite for me :P"
2,"Went here in January, on a saturday. place was more packed than a can of sardines! couldn't even reach the bar, getting to the restroom was almost out of the question, and actually, now that i remember, even getting into the bar itself was a pain. people standing in the doorway smoking. lol. I'm sure its nice when its not that busy, but if you happen to go when it is too busy, just run across the street to haus 73 and get cozy there."
3,"This was a very good eating experience at a very reasonable price for a competitive high end menu in a friendly ambience. We sampled all the appetizers, I was especially taken by the grilled calamari and the ceviche, not too crazy about the tatar. Fellows at my table had the dorade and the risotto with prawns and I heard good things about those as well. I went for the raised ochsenbacke which are the butt cheeks of the ox. That was a delightful piece of meat, extremely tender and flavorful, with a green mash potato better than any mash potato i have had. Their creme brulee is worth a try. Service was a bit slow."
0,"The food might be ok, but the waitress / unbelievable unfriendly and rude. We had to go to the front to get the menu and clear our own table. Horrible!"
4,"This is a coffee roasting venture of tow sweetest Iranian brothers. Everything is self made and passion driven with love for coffee. There is many varieties of coffee you can buy there. All self roasted to perfection and packed in slickly designed ,by one of the talented brothers ,white packages. You can also try tow varieties of coffee there.  Everything around you is very stylishly designed and thoughtfully put together.  What I also love is  that nobody is asking you to sit down when you order your coffee at the counter(always a bad sign that you have to wait for your single shot of expresso for half an hour). Service is fast and quality of coffee is consistent and excellent ."
1,"Kofookoo is very spacious and nicely decorated. I liked the high ceiling and the interesting light fixtures. The menu is all you can eat or you can order al a carte. Just so we can try more dishes, we went for the all you can eat. We came at lunch on a weekend so it was 15.90 per person--honestly rather steep for the quality of food. I had a hankering for sushi so we ordered most of the sushi, especially those with the raw fish. The only decent thing was the sake (salmon). The octopus and squid were super chewy and had no flavor. The tuna maki was a little concerning because the rice around the fish had turned pink. That shouldn't happen unless the fish was dyed, or something. Also all the maki tasted like they was pre-made and left out for awhile. We tried the warm dishes and the tofu was the most tasty so we ordered a second one, but it was cut too thick so the center was not warm at all. The best part about the food was the black sesame ice cream; we ordered two portions and ate it with the fried kokos creme and fried banana. We got the fruit salad and it was melon that had obviously been cut and sitting there for some time.The staff was nice and friendly and the service was good and quick. However, I wouldn't come back."
4,"Parlament is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in the basement of the equally beautiful town hall building in Hamburg. The restaurant is dark and romantic, with amazing architectural details, commanding furniture, candlelit tables, and a gorgeous, illuminated full bar in the center of the enormous room. I came here with two friends from Hamburg who speak German as their native language and were able to request an easy-to-read English menu for me. Parliament has a liquor menu but I opted for just still water, saving my calories for the delicious food. I opted for currywurst which is made with lamb and dressed in a rich, brown, curry-laden sauce and served with a generous side of thick, fresh steak fries. My dinnermates ordered the same and we were brought a pot of mayonnaise for dipping our fries (though this is obviously quite standard in Hamburg, it is not something we do in America and though foreign to me, I totally got on board with mayo as a condiment for fries and ended up enjoying it on more than one occasion). The service was as expected in Germany - never cloying, well-paced, and unrushed. This would be a fantastic place to bring a date or to enjoy a leisurely dinner with friends."
4,"Luigis is, BY FAR, the best Italian food I've had anywhere in Germany.  The pizza is wood fired and huge...fresh ingredients and superb.  The pasta bolognese was outstanding as well...noodles were perfectly al dente.  I don't ever give five stars...this would have been six stars."
4,"Loved this place! Definitely the best Indian food we've found in Hamburg. I think you can't go wrong with ordering any dish here. Loved the naan and chicken curry. Definitely not a pretty restaurant and service here is not anything to write home about, so the food here is the star!I wish Germany had more of these types of restaurant options, where you order at the counter and pick up your food when it's ready. Easy, quick and cheap! Love it!"
4,"We both ordered a ""Mars Menu"": (I) pulpo salad (II) chicken with mashed potatoes (III) vanilla ice-cream with strawberries. All for Euro 38 per person. It was excellent and the portions were quite large. We sat at the bar and the service was very professional and friendly. The noise level was high but this well reflected the good atmosphere of the staff and guests. We will certainly return here again in the future."
3,"Arguably the most centrally located restaurant in the Hamburg, being situated in the vaulted basement of the City Hall (and just around the corner from Rathousmarkt station).Good selection of food, good service, reasonable prices.  And - always useful for the traveller - English menus if needed.In summer months they also open a Terrace in the City Hall courtyard."
3,I have heard repeatedly from my internal monologue as I walk past cafe May that they do good cocktails of an evening.  I have yet to experience them.  10/10 review. Would read again.
3,"3 Euro for a falafel brot (which is actually a wrap). It is hot, tasty, but not the best i had. In Berlin one can find much better falafel joints. This place is an amazing solution for hunger after midnight when most place are closing down. I was afraid a vegan like me would not find  anything at this time, but found this as a great option. The place was full, and there is a cozy sit down tables on a gallery upstairs."
4,"Oh my good - Jenfeld. This Part of Hamburg is not really known as a top place to go. But ""top"" often means a typical place for hipsters and or tourists. So - follow the stars of yelp and get surprised.To me Hoang Mai is one the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. Uuuugh, its ugly here. First problem - the door is closed. In general you enter the restaurant via the shop beside. Hey if you solved this problem, the spartan interior and green walls may make you think ""am I right here"". YES YOU ARE!!!The waitress suddenly turned up, presented the menu. Asked If we are in first time. Explained all options of the menu (in really perfect German). Some of the food is vegetarian, but can be ordered with broth. In this case, broth is made of bones - no longer vegetarian at all. Good to now but anyway - bone broth, sounds really good!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because most of the people here are Asians. One more point to assume the food is authentic!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because the taste is mmmmmmmm really incredible. Portions are OK. Referring to the amount and quality, the price is ok, not cheap but neither expensive. So follow the stars - 'cause Yelp will help you to find the hidden stars!"
3,"The museum itself is a nice museum with a lot of interesting things, but after seeing the miniature wonderland and the maritime museum, I had more than enough miniature buildings and boats. Only was able to stay 15 minutes before I couldn't take anymore of it."
3,"Not the best quality of food, great deal nonetheless. For €4,50 you can get a jumbo Döner. If you're looking for good, fast, cheap food. I would go to Batman the Restaurant."
3,I feel like the Warehouse district (Speicherstadt) is a time capsule.  There are a lot of old warehouse buildings in this area.  Each warehouse tells a rich story that played a major role in Hamburg's history.  This area is a great place for a stroll and will be more fulfilled if you have a guided tour or read up on it first in a tour book.
3,"Full on a tuesday evening!We just had a quick beer there.The bar is really laidback, cool. there are tables outside and inside.Its around 5 mins away by foot from the busy schulterblatt, in a very quite street.There are two rooms: smoking and non smoking.Although i didnt eat, the people sitting on the table next to me had ordered a burger. I was drooling over it. it looked so delicious! (costs 7EUR60, with salad and fries on the side and free ketchup!) next time im there, im definitely having it!"
3,"Good value for money.Decoration looks very authentic India-like, though the place could be cleanerRecommend it"
2,"Had a quick lunch in this Portuguese quarter near the clock tour on Sunday. Pleasantly surprised I must say. There are so many restaurants at this corner it's a bit confusing as to where to go. The lunch plates were about 15 euros each, and we had two entrees among the three of us. One was grilled squid plate, which was excellent, and the other was what seemed to be white fish fillets cooked in tomato cream sauce. The latter is also decent and gets three stars. The service was not outstanding but was acceptable. Clean bathrooms. Can't complain and did not regret going."
4,"If you like fine cocktails, a great variety of Whiskeys and a lot of other good beverages, this is the place for you. This bar has a touch of luxury and class, people do like to dress up when they come here. They also offer snacks, if you'd become hungry after the 3rd to 5th drink :)The staff is working in a pro-manner and is really friendly. I recommend reserving a table at the Bacardi Lounge."
3,"Yum! By word of mouth I ended up at Quán dò last night and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is small and stylish. Red walls and colorful lanterns turn up the fun factor here. We waited a few minutes to get a table inside and it was worth it. I got the bun with sesame pork and it was simple and savory. I like how Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg don't use msg so the food tastes fresher and cleaner. My bun was good! It came with cucumbers, carrots, peanuts, rice noodles, and grilled pork. My green tea came out scorching hot so I had to wait a while to drink it. Quán dò is good for people watching, grabbing a bite to eat before you hit the town, or just to have a casual night out with a buddy. I will definitely be back. CASH ONLY."
2,pretty good if you like ostrich meat - it's the theme of the restaurant (strauss is German for ostrich).
0,"Germany big cities are trying to trend it up with Asian Fusion food everywhere but bare in mind in Northern part of Germany they dont neccessarily find Asians as Beautys.First off, I'm sad this is just another Western water down fast food joint where the quality is shit and everything is over salted and spicy portion dropped for the Scandinavian palate.I recommend for Authentic Vietnames, go to Green Papaya down the street.It's always packed and this is probably reason why others suck cause the Best is always packed and too popular."
3,On the way into Deichgraf there is an inconspicuous little photo on a table in the hallway. If you stop to look at it you'll notice that it's a photo of Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder in the restaurant! I guess that means this place is well regarded. The restaurant is certainly well decorated with antique furniture and original paintings. THe prices are medium-high rather than mega-expensive. Myself and two friends had lunch here for EUR30. I don't know what my meal was called but it was delicious and being the lunch special was only EUR8.80.
4,"As a big fan of all things Middle Eastern, I can appreciate good falafel. The food served at Falafel Haus is simply great; nothing chewy or dry, like in those drunk-food döner places. The falafel is freshly fried, their hummus is delicious, the prices more than fair, and the service is friendly and quick.I would highly recommend it as the best falafel I've had in Europe!"
4,"I loved this place! The staff is very friendly and fast! However, in case you don't like waiting for others to finish eating, I suggest you to book a table in advance :)"
4,"Really good quality meat. Hefty portions for very reasonable prices, especially take away. Really friendly staff who know their stuff & always put a smile on your face when you go in (think it's family owned)."
0,"Horrible food. Will never dare to order it again. I ordered the food online. So, can not comment on the ambience"
4,"The place is my personal Vietnamese heaven. Veggie soup is very tasty and filling. A delicate veggie broth, rice noodles, tofu and green vegetables - that is what you get as a vegetarian/vegan pho option for 7 euros. So worth the money! Another vegan option I can suggest is a noodle salad with tofu. It's very flavorful and refreshing, but ask about fish sauce in advance!   Will come back for sure!"
4,"Absinth bar is back! Hurrah! It was always one of the best and most unique bars in Hamburg and now after a year away it has returned bigger and better than ever! If you're familiar with it's old location this is literally more of the same. ""More"" in that it's much bigger, but it still retains the charm it used to have. With the increased space it seems that they're already attracting more customers, so the place is full most nights. One minor problem in these cold winter nights is that they seriously need to fix the door to make it close itself automatically. Trust me, after 10 minutes of sitting in there on a cold night you'll understand! My review of the old Absinth bar: We were on the way home from Omas. We were going to show our friend around the best bars in the schanze, but then we noticed the Absinth bar. We actually walked past, but then while discussing it briefly, we thought ""hey, why not"" and went back. The place is tiny, but really well decorated with a beautiful bar full of every kind of Absinth there is. The walls have plaster strategically removed in patches to give it a pseudo-shambolic feel. Not knowing one Absinth from the next we asked for some ordering advice. We were asked do you like it bitter? Do you like it sweet? Bottles were brought to the table and opened for us to sniff. I do wonder whether the service is always so great, because we were the only four people in there! Anyway, for us the service was great. Our chosen drinks were brought on silver plates, with silver spoons holding an absinth dowsed sugar cube. The owner then set alight each cube for us, and explained how to drink our drinks - for our second round there were different instructions for different absinths. All in all a very unique experience, and surprisingly relaxing and tasty."
4,"Awesome Beer, Fantastic Food, perfect environment and a wonderful staff to boot. I love this place and can't say enough positive things about it!"
3,"Being that I'm just a big kid really visiting Zoo's is something I haven""t stopped doing just because I'm now an adult. Excited easily by cute animals and monkeys antics, I""m the type of person who will happily buy a year long ticket to the Zoo just so I can go whenever I please. This Zoo is perfect for taking the kids out, going for a picnic or a just a great day out! At $15 euros it""s not too bad but definitely isn't cheap considering the size of the Zoo. Already I""m a little disappointed by looking at the map and the limited animal displays it shows on it. Disappointment doesn""t last long though as Hamburg Zoo has a brillent Elephant set up, where you can feed these gentle giant beasts with precut vegetables and pet their wet long noses to you hearts content. My highlight were- - The Elephants- The Lions- Seeing 3 baby leopards with their mother hiding from peoples view.- The petting Zoo where I think I may have been the only person in our group to actually get in the enclosure with the goats and pick up a kid. Was disappointed that the polar bears were missing and the penguins looked bored... It""s definitely not Sydney's Taronga Zoo that's for sure, the animal selection isn""t as big or varied as most big city Zoos I've visited have been. Although this is the first zoo I've'been to that you can buy beer and drink it as you walk around (definately doing that next time!!) and there was this nice pizza stall in the middle of it that I saw that did woodfire pizzas and wine which looked pretty good. Have plans to go again in the next couple of weeks with some more friends!"
4,"One of my favorite go to spots. This very unpretentious yet really delicious restaurant is one of our staples. From the great pizza with crispy crust and mozzarella (instead of Gouda) excellent Italian wine selection and the best family owners in the neighborhood, it is definitely worth a visit. If you plan to be there on a weekend or busier night, definitely reserve or call ahead to ensure a table is available. Guten Appetite!"
4,"It's Saturday night, the place is packed to the limit and the bar staff is doing an amazing job! Sitting at the bar watching them proves they are fast, in a good mood (occasional staff shots) and are making good drinks! Compliments, best team in the area I have seen so far (and I live across the road)! Music, atmosphere etc flawless. Great place to kick off after pre drinks or dinner!PS: and if the bar had known, a shared round of staff shots was offered to me and my friends shortly after posting my review! Glad I had nothing bad to say!"
3,"I went on an English Hamburg Dungeon tour with my friend and it was really fun! It was informative and easy to understand, though I will admit that more of the focus is on the effects and experience. My friend got a little creeped out, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't walk through your basic haunted house."
0,Politely asking for my lamb to be cooked a bit more and then getting it back microwaved...
4,"Absolutely love this place!! From the outside it looks a bit run down and you may be even turned off by it but once you step inside you won't regret it. It reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in New York with its dark wood paneling, red tablecloths, and Chinese artwork. The staff is extremely friendly and next to all the artwork you will notice several new clippings with regard to China Golden. That's right, they have been published in newspapers, magazines, and much more. The huge menu has everything you could imagine and more. The prices are a bargain for what you get and what you get is a feast. The smells, the taste, and the atmosphere are to die for. I can't recommend 1 dish since I love them all as if they were my children but just trust me and stop by China Golden and see for yourself."
3,"After hearing a lot of good words of this place, we decided to give it a second chance. This time they didn't disappoint us. The food is served really quickly, like 15 mins after we ordered. To be fair, the burger is really really tasty. And I love the sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo. After we finished, there were people waiting in a line for our table. And it is just a normal Tuesday lunch time. Will recommend it to friends, but just be ware that might be long waiting time for the table or the food."
4,"We were able to book a last minute tour here in English. The guide was very informative and taught us a lot about the whole chocolate making process. We also got to taste the chocolate at different forms in the process and make our own bar to take home. If you're planning on visiting, I would recommend booking early, as there are not as many English tours available. Another bonus is that the bathroom here is FREE."
4,"They get some fresh fish from the market as a whole, which the guys like to show off, and filet them in the restaurant to make the freshest pieces of fish you can get. Then they are grilled and served in some very unique and excellent way. I loved the flavours they have introduced in the sauces which are not just the standard type of things you will find in a restaurant. A highlight are the gambas flambe and the fresh fish with Mediterranean veggies. Beside the excellent food the service is also great and in addition there is guy playing the guitar (actually he is palying really, really well). Holiday feeling at it's best in a small restaurant in Hamburg."
3,Bored on Sunday night and want to drink till 4am with loads of old people instead of thinking about work? Here's your venue!
4,"Good reviews, although surrounded by soulless chain options down in the belly of the former state bank's mall: obviously had to try this!A very friendly greeting, and you sense immediately that this is an authentic, handmade place. Competitive prices: a mix of 3 different tacos plus a drink (do go for the sugar free homemade lemonade) will be 10€, the daily lunch option just 7€ with drink. But you will also want the freshly made (fresh as in: they make it right in front of you) guacamole.The tacos are excellent - not sophisticated excellent, but Mexico taco stall excellent. The lemonade tastes like the model every lemonade everywhere should taste like. And the guacamole, well, could just be more of it!The location in a food court is as pedestrian as they come, but if you sit inside, with the back to the court, it actually feels like the hand built taco stall it is, with colorful chairs, great music, and thick stone bowls for that guacamole.Please also add some Baja-style fish taco to your menu!!Will absolutely be back, don't go away."
2,"I found this lovely little place by posting a question on the Yelp Hamburg page as I was looking for somewhere that did a high tea sort of spread in Germany.We travelled for over an hour and it took a while to find the place but I was so glad we made the effort.We arrived mid morning and as we were really hungry we got tea, breakfast and I had a scone. The breakfast itself was something I'm not used to simply because of the combination of food that we got. I did find it to be the norm in Germany though with slight variations, the plate had fruit, a warm hard boiled egg, some jam, fresh tomato and a very crunchy but yummy roll. We had English breakfast tea which was tasty. I'm not a cream person so I only had jam on my scone but it was nice.The building itself was old and very old fashioned with lots of pictures of the queen. Had a very British feel and it was lovely. Staff although friendly were very hard to find when you wanted them and I had to go looking when I wanted to order scones and when I wanted to pay.I will definitely go back next time I'm in Hamburg as we had a very enjoyable day.Had I not had to chase staff it would have got 4 stars for sure and I would still recommend this place if you want something old fashioned with a bit of charm and an English feel."
4,"Food is great, taste good, but not authentic. The service puts it over the top, you can't find good service like this anywhere outside of the US. The service here is even better than the US Vietnamese restaurants."
3,Great hidden but very busy spot.  Absolutely delicious coffee. Solid bagel sandwiches & delicious marzipan cruffin. Offer huge variety of coffees they roast on site so you can bring some delicious beans home. Only downside is it's often packed and hard to maneuver around or find a seat.
4,"I had come to Hamburg to listen to the magnificent Kate Tempest and my parents decided to come with me. Not to listen to the words of a slam poet, but to eat food and see the city, mind. We found Sagners because of the great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. Because we like to eat in our family, but usually don't have the stomach space to contain all the food we want to devour, we came to Sagners not that hungry. But there is a little something for everyone here. I had scrambled eggs with shrimp on blackbread, which could be awfully dull, but actually tasted like fresh shrimp straight from the sea combined with perfectly scrambled eggs. It was good. Sitting outside is not that attractive as it leads to a pretty busy road, but you'll soon forget it with all of that German beer and seaside fare inside you."
2,Delicious but maybe not as hyped as everyone says. Not worth waiting 30-40min by any means.
3,"The burger is simply amazing and service keep improving over time.I would recommend Dulf's as a great place to have a burger with friends, but be aware that they do not take reservation over phone."
4,"Jimmy Elsass is a bit of a cult favorite among friends and coworkers, so I'm under a lot of pressure to give them anything but five stars. But then again, they've earned it on every single one of my visits. The space itself is a bit dark and dreary (very reminiscent of Hamburg itself), but the service is friendly and helpful, and the food and drink are excellent. ""Elsass"" is German for Alsace, and the menu is dominated by flammkuchen, the Alsatian baked flatbread specialty, with all kinds of toppings. I always get something different, and they're all good, but you can't go wrong with an original (cream, onions, lardons). The wine is also dominated by Alsatian options, all of which are also quite good. The waiters mostly speak English, and they only accept cash payment. Give it a try."
4,"This place has great coffee! The food was fresh and quick and very reasonably priced. The staff were friendly and efficient. Plus, they allow dogs!"
4,"After many years come back to this well known place The prices still in the upper range makes the expectations grow :)The food still one of the best, fresh herbes, fresh fish, real Thai taste Excellent! I like to sit at the window, the big room inside  even with a lot of high style Thai decoration  does not make me feel comfortable."
3,"Dean and David is a nice place to have lunch in the city, as it is located close to the main station. I tried the curry, which was very tasty. The staff was very nice and I liked the interior as well. It is simple but very nice.You need to go up some stairs to get to the restaurant."
4,"delicious! good service with fast serving food. the menu changes everyday. limited choices but that also means, they perfected those dishes. only downside is, they do not open during the weekend and it closes fairly early in the evening."
4,"Had a great 3 course lunch menu here for EUR6.90: salad buffet, soup and a choice of main courses. Impressed."
2,"This restaurant was my saving grace while I was in Hamburg, and while it wasn't exactly American fare, it got the job done.I was staying in the hotel right next to here, so on cold nights, it was such a relief to finish up my training and duck into Jim Block's to grab a carry out burger. The first night I went, I made the mistake of getting a BBQ burger. The BBQ sauce was less than pleasant and I welcome all Germans to swing over to the US sometime to try a taste of our BBQ, because you won't want to go back ;-). The fries I had were tasty and I appreciated that they offered mayo and ketchup in easy little plastic packs. The 2nd night, having learned my lesson, I got an ordinary cheeseburger which was quite good. I also go a baked potato instead of fries and that was outstanding. Hot, salty, soft, and served with an ample side of sour cream, this really hit the spot on a cold night!I would definitely come back to Jim Block again for dinner in Hamburg!"
4,Eins meiner Top 3 Lieblingsrestaurants in Winterhude. Die Trüffel Pasta ist himmlisch! Der Service wirklich sehr gut. Im Sommer kann man gut draußen sitzen. Drinnen ist es sehr gemütlich und klassisch eingerichtet. Kann ich nur wärmstens weiter empfehlen.
3,"My roommate loves pasta and she wanted to come along to my last nice dinner with my boyfriend who was visiting for the weekend, so of course I took her recommendation but na klar did not take her along. Ordered the creamy salmon pasta - nice saltiness, perfectly fatty sauce with generous chunks of cooked salmon wrapped inside the noodles. Partner got the simple tomato sauce pasta - it was a bit on the plain side and a bit too salty, particularly with extra Parmesan. The Parmesan in itself was a highlight though - this cute, bright grater that looked like a children's toy was filled to the brim with real Parmesan AND left at our table so we could indulge ad hoc in Parma heaven. We also had some house wine, which was very generous for the price, and the setting was also very cute - I had some doubts about the location, right next to Landungsbrücke, but Pastalozzi is off on a side street and we were the only ones sitting at a dimly lit, dark oak table in the back. Also candles! What romance! Parmagnificent."
2,"Having been to the original location in Munich, the Hamburg location was a little disappointing.  Service was very slow and staff was really much less interactive with our table.  Food is not bad, there certainly weren't any surprises, but I felt the food at the Munich location was a step above what we had in Hamburg.  If you are in Germany and will not have a chance to hit up the location in Munich, its certainly a place to try if you have a few days, but I would honestly recommend another location for good local German food.  This location is definitely for tourists from outside of Germany."
3,"Haifisch Bar is such an archetype of a Hamburg harbour bar that it almost hurts to see its raw realness. Loads of dusty, mysterious memorabilia all over the place. Reminding you of the good old days when the rough sailors were there on shore leave for strong drinks, picking fights and the girls. The furniture and bar are very old-fashioned - but not in that trendy retro way, it just IS original. A bar, some stools, a few tables and that's it.The lady behind this bar is profesionally friendly and nothing like the big-mouthed trollop you'd expect. Drinks are free of any glamour so you'd get your plain Astra or Jever. Prost!I have also been there for a 2 funky fiestas thrown by a business friend for their clients. So apparently there was food involved for the media people, too. And guess what? It was home-style cooking à la Hamburg: a buffet consisting of meatballs, bread rolls with fish, fish cake and potato salad. And everybody liked it.. as spoilt as they may be. Amazing!Maybe some thought this place was especially set up for them as a big spectacle?! So it's definitely worth checking out even though it can get pretty touristy (No photography allowed!). But if you wish to experience the real Hamburg, please do go."
4,"My wife and I stopped here for dinner after work one night. I've only been in Hamburg for a month or so, but this is easily the best burger I've had in my time here. I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my wife got the Zillertaler Bacon Burger, and both were fantastic. Her's was a little heavy on the sauce, but that didn't really detract from the burger other than to make it messier. Prices were also totally reasonable.They've got great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. They even project whatever is on TV outside as well, so we were able to keep half an eye on the F1 qualifier."
3,"The one and only place at Hamburg to celebrate Wiener Schnitzel. But, be aware : this place is still well known. So make a reservation!"
3,"The fried spring rolls had crispy perforated wrappers and a solid meat and vegetable filling. The sweet Thai chili sauce accompanying it was straight out of the bottle, but tasted better when tweaked with the house pickled chili and garlic on the table. The Summer rolls were tight and served sushi style. The peanut sauce that came with it was good.The Pho Bo (beef) broth was actually really good. Noodle texture and thin sliced beef were all excellent. And the shredded herbs added a balance and interest to the flavors. The fried dough stick was a lovely authentic homage to how Pho is served in Vietnam, and a fun dipping companion for the broth.Caphe s'ua da (iced coffee) was fragrant, espresso strong and served unmixed so you can see the seductive dark brown hue. But evaporated milk was used--refined, but I much prefer the sweetened condensed milk versions."
4,"First time having Curry Worst, my brother has had it many times and we both thought it was fantastic."
4,"Let me preface this by writing that normally, I am not much of a zoo person. However, I was really impressed with Hamburg's Tropen Aquarium. I was amazed at the lemur exhibitthe lemurs jump on your shoulders, leap from ledge to ledge, and scurry around the floor. The zoo keeper in charge could tell them all apart and was clearly very experienced. While the lemurs were by far my favorite part of the aquarium, I also really liked the variety of fish and reptiles they had. I even got to see a live feeding of the sharks! You don't have to be a kid to be really wow'ed by this place."
0,Do not reserve tables online. We arrived with a reservation and they were full. Refused us a table even though I showed the reservation on my phone. We reserved several nights in advance for our last night on our vacation and ended up with having a burger instead!
3,"Good burgers, but nothing special. The fried were nice as well. Overall, I'd recommend it to watch some sports."
0,The WORSE customer service I ever faced in my life .. I went with my family asked the hostess about a table ...: she said 45 mins max and she took our number ... went back to her after 45 mins .. she said sorry no tables for u today...  and that she told us waiting time is 2 hrs ... she was treating us extremely bad .. is it because we r from the gulf ? My kids were starving and waiting .. for nothing ...
0,"Don't expect to get customer service. If you're lucky enough to get customer service, the coffee is great, but we're leaving now after 20 minutes of waiting. Even though the waiter has cleaned the table, he didn't ask what we'd like to drink. Also waving at the other waitress didn't help. So, thanks for nothing. See you never."
2,"Very friendly staff, they made us feel very welcome and we were even drinking shots together.The starter was great, the overall fish quality was very good. However, they serve the fish with very flavoured sauces which don't suit the great fish quality. We've recommended them to serve the sauce on the side rather than on top of the fish.Also a bit expensive, 2 people - 100€ for menu and bottle of wine."
2,"I'm glad I went, but I also wish I spent more time on the Reeperbahn during my stay in Hamburg, and this is what I would cut out. It was a fun experience that's not too far away from other things you'll probably want to see, but it wasn't as educational or informative as I thought it would be.I went alone, and ended up being the only person on the submarine for most of my time down there. I was creeped out a lot more than I thought - it's a really tight and dark space with terrible gas fume smells. There's a loud engine room, but the rest of the space has fake sonar ping audio being piped in. There's little camera lenses cut into various walls so the people in the office can watch you as you browse through, but other than that, you're free to go at your own pace - provided there's enough room for others to squeeze by. Also, I'm really hoping all the white fibrous insulation isn't asbestos.All the original signage and instruments are in Russian (which is awesome) and there's some English signs showing what rooms were used for. Don't go if you have any mobility issues, you will be climbing up and through awkward holes.If you're looking for something nearby that might be more interesting, I thought the Alter Elbtunnel that goes under the river with a massive elevator for cars was pretty exciting."
3,"Super cute place! Very American, love how they cater to vegetarians! But I will say that it would prob be in your best interest to get there around 8am or earlier or after 1pm. It's very small inside. Maybe less than 14 tables and I'm highballing it. Well worth the experience and very reasonably priced. Portions are large so if you are American like us please know you can not order multiple things like how we do at IHOP or Waffle House and eat off of those small plates. Literally you will be full off of one plate. Oh yea and I had THE best veggie burger I've ever had and I don't normally like veggie burgers but this was amazing."
4,That was definitely the fastest served burger i've ever had. It was also tasty. Fries could be better though. Still 5 stars because i enjoyed the burger and dont care about fries.
3,Very good food and friendly service. I've had very good Fish & chips ( crispy and not fat). Not expensive considering the neighbourhood. I recommand it !
4,"Alright I'm gonna be honest here: I got into this place purely by accident. I was particularly hungry, tired, and I couldn't be bothered walking any further. I saw the light, I saw the Italian sign and I just decided 'right, that will do!"":)I was seated within less than 10mn by another lonely chap at the nearby table and greeted cheerfully by the staff. It felt really cosy and the place has a really homy atmosphere, with a mix of locals, business customers as well as a few tourists like me.I was provided with the menu but as I probably know 2 words of German, the waiter nicely gave me an overview of what was on offer and made some suggestions. A glass of red wine, truffle Carpaccio and a perfectly cooked filet later, I was full and content :). The food was lovely and the thing that then came to mind at that stage was that it was probably going to cost me an armbut gosh, this was ex-cel-lent italian food!44EUR later:)  No regret here though. This was a lovely Italian restaurant with well cooked and selected food, excellent customer service and I'll certainly recommend it in the future. I really don't have a problem spending money when the whole experience is top notch from start to finish. Plus, let's be honest, I already know the hotel menu off by heart now so a bit of adventure was needed anyway!"
4,"I have had turkish food all over turkey and this place is just as good. A long line to order lunch but once I got through that, i ended up getting the chicken donner plate and it was legit. The rice had the needed texture/softness and the chicken was moist but not soggy. Outside of the kebabs I ate staring at the Galata bridge in Istanbul, this place is it. I guess come around 1PM if you want to avoid the lunch rush."
3,So a place called Mr. Kebab is not exactly what you would think of as great for a pesqutarian. This though was one of my favorite meals in Hamburg. There were a whole bunch of vegetarian options and the one I got was absolutely delicious. My mouth waters thinking of this restaurant. Great place to visit!
4,"Fuck yeah, finally some pizza that doesn't leave me hating myself and my choices in food delivery."
4,"Wow. I used to live in Munich when I was a kid and have fond memories of eating Spätzle. Eating the Spätzle here was like that scene from Ratatouille, where the food critic takes that bite of food and is transported to his youth. The Spätzle is handmade and delicious. They seem to take great care to source quality ingredients. I had the cheese Spätzle with onions and bacon. I also requested a little of their brown sauce/gravy on the side. This place is also vegan friendly, with vegan options of most of their dishes. Would definitely recommend this place."
3,"Shiso is favorite lunch spot near work. Fun Asian-ish deco inside with a fusion burger menu. The shrimp burger is my favorite and totally dog their fries. If I am not getting the shrimp burger, it can be a hit or miss with the rest. The most common problem being the burger being too smaller than the buns and sliding out with the sauces on the steamer basket. Oh yes, they serve the burgers and fries in steamer baskets, pretty neat!The pineapple mint shake is a must!"
0,"Food was ok, but my husband spent a portion of the evening chained to the big white chair...Avoid."
4,"I love going to Oren Ishii for lunch, and it is some of the best Vietnamese fusion I've ever had. It can get pretty busy during lunch, so I recommend getting their either a little bit before noon or around 12:30 when the first wave of people leaves.The menu changes every week with options for soup, chicken, meat and vegetarian available. I've had several things from each category and have come to find that chicken is usually a bit bland, and the meat options tend to be more flavoured.The ginger lemonade is yummy and a great accompaniment to spicier dishes :)I have to say my absolute two favourite meals since coming here were the pork belly steamed buns and the chicken wings!! Would love to see things like this pop up more on weekly menus."
3,"Pretty awesome place, I found it after reading the Yelp reviews as there are 4 falafel places in a row pretty much. Service for starters was welcoming, even though the place was busy in my opinion I was treated with respect and the owners seemed humble. That was a nice feeling to start off with.I ordered a falafel with aubergine, the best was when I saw it being wrapped - it was huge! All for 3,50 Eur, awesome. And delicious - great to know you're not eating meat and it still fills you and tastes great.The joint actually has a smallish upstairs section including toilet, and apparently they have Wifi as well, but I couldn't find the password. The upstairs section was really cosy for a takeaway kind of place, clean as well. I'll definitely come back here and try more things from the menu."
3,"Amazing displays, super crowded, but a fun place for kids and adults. Def. book advanced tickets. There's a helpful charging stations with all kinds of cords to plug your phone in if you have exhausted its battery by taking too many pictures, lol."
3,"I love the taste of the coffee, the cake, the Alster view, everything. Service is nice. A little more smile would give 5 stars :)"
1,"Leider nicht so gut. Das Essen lag eher auf dem Niveau des Lieblingsvereins des hier ansässigen Fanclubs  gerade noch zweitklassig. Zum Mittagstisch hatte ich Gyros in Metaxasauce für 6 Euro. Die Menge war in Ordnung, der Geschmack der Sauce ok, wenn auch nicht an Metaxa erinnernd. Das Fleisch war aber kaum genießbar  knorpelig, hart, überwürzt und trocken. Ich hatte den Eindruck, als wäre es vorgegart und wieder aufgewärmt worden."
2,"The food was only mediocre and although the staff was friendly, it was clear most of them were inexperienced. We ordered a lot and shared the dishes:Rump steak (medium rare): this steak was undercooked (although I preferred it that way), it wasn't actually medium rare, but it was pretty good.Rib eye steak (medium rare): this steak was pretty tasteless.Caesar salad: had a weird flavor going on. Wasn't traditional caesar salad (in a bad way).Potato Wasabi Puree: interesting, but the charred avocado on top didn't do much.Grilled white asparagus: these were pretty good. Had a nice asian flavor.Marinated beefsashimi: this was mostly raw beef with a sear on the outside. There was some sort of fruit the same color as the meat, which was a surprise to bite into. This was interesting.Sashimi from loupnde mer (with grilled watermelon and san deniele ham): this wasn't so great. Didn't really work as a dish.Southern apple tuna roll (with tunasashimi, granny smith apple, avocado, basil, and soy caramel): this was pretty good. Interesting, but you couldn't really taste the apple, it might as well have been cucumber.Salmon Hand Roll: this was okay. It had a lot of mayo and not so much salmon.California Roll: decent. Nothing special.Chicken Skewer Yakitori: drenched in syrup, but the onions and chicken were okay. Wouldn't go back again, but it wasn't terrible."
3,The restaurant wears a pleasant atmosphere with nice aroma everywhere. I had pasta which i think was the best i had till date.
1,"I was there last night with a couple of friends who raved about La sepia, saying - and i quote - the best fish they have had. I am not a fish fan, but i do love seafood. I got the seafood salad and we shared a plate of octopus. Well my salad was... dull.no sauce.fortunately it had a lot of seafood to make up for the unsaucy greens. the octopus were ok, i've had better. otherwise it was a busy night hence it was really slow. we didnt get served at the same time. drinks took around 15 minutes to get to our table. i wouldn't be back soon"
1,"It looks stylish inside but there are far better Italian places to eat - service was friendly however and it sounds like the pizza might be ""ok"".  The brown butter sage on cheese ravioli was sad, to say the least.  The ravioli tasted like average, pre cooked heated up ravioli.  The sauce was NOT brown butter sauce how it should be.  I was not worth €9,00.  I make this simple butter sauce at home and it's easy to make correctly.  What was served was not proper Browned butter but rather some kind of premade melted butter (probably with the typical shot of German sahne in the mix).  There were only 3 little sage leaves on the pasta making the flavor distribution a disappointment.  Wouldn't waste my money here... Especially in a city/country where eating out is not cheap."
3,"Ah Roschinsky's.. it's another of the almost identical bars on that side of Hamburger Berg. That mean's it's actually a pretty good bar, but you could just as easily pick any of 5-10 bars within 50 yards and have the same evening. - popular music? check.- dance floor? check.- cheap(ish) drinks? check.- good crowd? check.- free entry? check.- table football? check."
2,"I have now learned that the sub sandwiches that I attributed to being 'faux-croque' in my initial review are the norm for croques in Germany. That said the name of the place is still misleading; if the croques in Germany are typically sub sandwiches, I'd expect a place could Croque Francais  to serve the french style croques. Maybe that's just me.The rest of initial review still holds as it was based on the sandwich that I ate."
3,"Little Vietnamese restaurant that looks like it's family owned. Service was good and decor was nice. Menu is in German so bring your Google translate. Food is good by German standard. Since german food is usually not strong on spices it seemed like the taste had been brought down from the Vietnamese food offered in Canada.We had the shrimp and chicken cold rolls as an appetizer. The chicken was dry but the rest was ok. The sauce was the highpoint of this dish.As a main course I had the chicken curry. The curry had a good taste. It was indicated as a 2nd level of spicy out of 3 but it really was a 1 in my taste. My girlfriend had the pho and it tasted what it was supposed to.Overall a good experience that cost 23.70 euros for 1 appetizer, 2 main meal and 1 soft drink."
4,"This place is great. It's the only ""real"" bar in Hamburg where the bartendar probably knows more drinks than you. I used to tend bar so I am inclined to have a broad range in regards to drinks. The guys here blow me away with their knowledge. Great bartendars to ""chat"" with and talk alcohol. The vibe in the place is cool. Everyone is here because they know they are going to get the best drinks. Period! The fact that it's pretty classy in terms of the little details makes it that much better. I made the mistake last night of planning on going there after dinner for a drink with my girlfriend. Well, one drink became two and you know the rest of the story. Now I just need to figure out how best to get over there to go pick up my car. Tip: don't drive there for 1.) the obvious reason of thereafter not drinking and driving but, 2.) because there is no parking whatsover in the area.....it's all residential and you have to drive around quite a bit to find a ""legal"" spot for the car. In summary, if you're looking for ""hardcore"" bartending and really quality drink, this is your place. It's a bit off the beaten track but it's always ""on the way"" somehow. Do your best to visit!"
4,Great place. Good prices. Cozy and comfortable. Air is filled with scent of coffee and tasty cakes. Perfect spot for a coffee after a meal at Fish & Co.
1,"Food was good but not worth the money. Service was relatively average and although the location of the restaurant is great, the place is rather dead.FOOD:Great menu! A lot of interesting options gives a very nice first impression. The food is good but completely overpriced. It lacks the nice spicy taste of asian cuisine and it is not very traditional. Also I've noticed some Vietnamese restaurants have started adding onion crumbs into their buns (yeah those you add to hot dogs and other junk food). Unfortunately my dish had that unwanted ingredient. Until this point I had already thought of giving the place a solid three stars; however, the dish was full of hairs and eye lashes which cost them a good rating.SERVICE:Slow, careless and unfriendly. Unfortunately these are the first words that come to mind after eating here. The waiter was way too serious and rather unhelpful. Showed no patience and just wanted to get the job done. Also although we were initially alone in the restaurant it took forever for them to take our order, bring our food and later to take our card. A change in attitude (or staff) might help this restaurant improve its service. LOCATION: Hoheluftchaussee is one of Hamburg's nicest places to go out for dinner. It is very lively and there is a lot to choose from. However this restaurant is rather spiritless. On a positive note the place is big making it perfect for big groups and spontaneous visits without a reservation."
4,"What a find -- Xeôm greets you with an interior that wants to put you in the middle of a street stall scene in Vietnam without overdoing it. I really wonder how they got the confused, curled wiring of the lighting past a German electrician! :)They serve a very limited menu, which obviously often helps quality.It certainly does so here - authentic, very tasteful, and reasonably priced too. Don't overlook the homemade drinks, but note that some are somewhat sweet, so ask ahead.Brilliant place that fills up quickly despite its location 'around the corner', for good reason!"
3,"Cool bar on Bartelsstraße in the Schanze district of Hamburg. It's quite dark, with semi-comfy leather seating around the edges of the room, and inoffensive beats. The main attraction on a Tuesday night is the happy hour cocktails until 2200. I have to stress that happy hour in Germany is not the same as the UK - they are not half price. You're talking around EUR 4.50 for a caprhina and slightly more for a mojito - but they are very very good cocktails. You can order at the bar and then get them brought over to you, so you are free to enjoy the trippy electronic fish tank! This is the centrepiece of the bar, and has shallow water in which you can put your fingers and get the fish to chase you! I've never seen anything like it..."
2,"So many people had recommended Herr Max to us, so I looked forward to breakfast here.We ordered two different breakfasts, two coffee and two orange juices and the girls working here totally mixed it all up and forgot half of our order. When we finally got it all it both looked and tasted really good, and the café is really charming as well. I wish that I could give the café a better ranking, but unfortunately I found the service too bad for that. The girls forgot orders, ran around looking stressed behind the counter and had no order in what they were doing. And that's just stressful to watch as a customer, even if the food/cakes are good."
3,I am a bit harsh sometimes: They really improved and Tim and his team are doing a great job.It is a shame I cannot stop by more often.Love their lunch options with seafood!
4,"Awesome German food! A few nice Schnitzels to choose from (incl. a beer crust and a pretzel-breaded Schnitzel), as well as other pasta and meat specialties. Nice high-class brewery atmosphere  speaking of which, their beer is excellent. Fair prices as well, and a very central location. Friendly waitstaff. One of my favorite German food places in Hamburg!"
3,"It's a vegan cafe in St Pauli. With plenty of seating outdoors for the warmer days, this is a nice cafe run by very friendly people. The menu is not huge but enough choices to satisfy most people's needs. They have a daily specials board and a few options for drinks. It was packed the whole time we were there and it's a relatively young crowd. I had the club sandwich special and my wife had the quiche of the day. Food tasted good but I wish there was a little less leaves and red cabbage in both meals. The cake I had for dessert was also very nice. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this is a nice option in town. Even if you are not it's worth a try :-) It's reasonable, simple and clean food. Everything is super fresh and staff are friendly."
3,"Great service; friendly, observant, and check in with customers often. They do not except tips, and will make sure to hand it back to you, stating ""das werd nicht nötig, aber bis nächstes mal."" But I still recommend trying ;) Last, but certainly not least, the food was fantastically, authentically full of wonderfully spiced and seasoned flavors. I highly recommend this restaurant. Minus one star from Perfect, simply because the option on the menu for meals was a little confusing. But in the end I found the Ente and the veggie dish to be just what I wanted."
4,"Came across this restaurant while strolling along the Elbe, best service I had since I had moved to Hamburg. The lobster with truffle mashed potatoes is to die for! The seafood platter is also fresh and plenty for two people. Mojitos were delicious and they didn't hold back on the alcohol.I highly recommend this place for fresh seafood, great view since it is on the Elbe, and amazing customer service. Will come back for sure. Well deserved 5 stars. Also, the staff speaks multiple languages so everyone can feel at home."
4,"Some of best fish ever, and excellent service. Had a great food experience. Will come here again :)"
2,The 'Erste Liebe Bar' is a well designed modern coffee place in a great location. Away from traffic and noise. The interior is clean and modern with large bar and friendly staff. The breakfast menu is not huge but they have brilliant coffee and fresh juices. All in all a nice place with a pleasant atmosphere.
4,Best place to go before or after enjoying a movie in the cinema METROPOLIS  next door.
3,Better than Va Piano since I can sit and wait for the food to be served at more less the same price. Go for the pizza.
3,The café is super cute and everything is designed with attention to detail. The atmosphere was very cozy and the staff very friendly.We ordered Bio Rührei which was delicious and also fairly inexpensive! Can highly recommend! They forgot our order once and the bill took quite a while but other than that it was great! :)
3,"Great place, thanks yelp!Cute, authentic and very cosy inside spread over 2 floors with a mezzanine.Had a quick dinner here with my sister before heading to the airport.Had one with mushrooms and a fried egg on top. Super tasty & filling for about 9€!"
4,"Stopped by for lunch to realize that the dining room was closed (didn't plan ahead) so we made dinner reservations on the spot. It was mid-week and they were pretty much booked but we snagged a spot for a late-ish dinner.While we waited for our table (we were early), we enjoyed well-prepared cocktails at the bar. Were seated after a very short wait, drinks in hand. Ordered the Entrecôte which comes with corn on the cob, a salad, and your choice of one sauce or butter. I also opted to add a side dish of Kartoffel Röstzwiebel Stampf--a warm, savory, and buttery potato and onion mash which rounded out the meal quite well. Steaks were tender and perfectly cooked, portions were fair, and service was prompt and friendly. Chimichurri sauce was a bit bland but the herb butter was lovely. The house red wine was priced modestly and complemented the steak very well. The table next to us  ordered the ""surprise"" three course meal which consisted of a salad, fish with vegetables, and ice cream dessert. It appeared tasty and they seemed to enjoy it. The space is vast and open with low backed booths and wide and comfy chairs which makes it easy to observe what's going on all around. It's a bit loud, but tables are large enough to give each party enough space. Restaurant is busy, but the bustle isn't intrusive and staff was pleasant across the board. Location is convenient and the restaurant is easy to find. Experience was overall very positive and we're glad we checked it out."
3,"This place has potential. Their service is slow, but the food is pretty good. The vegan pizzas are tasty. I think they need to work out the kinks in their delivery times, and they can be great."
4,Nice feature! A must have souvenir.
4,"""Hipster coffee place"" has become to mean something different to me. Instead of meaning "" pretentious "" it became to me a sign of ""quality"" . Now I see it as those people are crazy passionate for coffee. Non hipster places often would have quality depending on who is working today. But this place is true hipster. It is always a good expresso no matter who is working today."
4,Fantastic food at affordable prices in a quick and efficient way. It doesn't get a any better than this for a lunch break.. Oh did I mention there's a great outside area? There is!I had one of the best bolognese pasta dishes here of my life. Yeah. And I didn't had to wait for it I just ordered it quickly and enjoy it. Good selection of local drinks and sodas.Great to eat outside on a sunny and beautiful summer day.
4,"The chocolate tour was very interesting. Learned a lot about chocolate, where it comes from and how it's made.  Enjoy tastes from every step of the process and make your own chocolate bar. Super fun time ad great quality chocolate!"
3,It's close to the wonderland. After visiting that I just searched restaurant and choose ti breizh. It's cheaper and more delicious than i imagine. But the passion juice is too sweet.，
3,"American tourist here. Ate here on a Sunday with wife and daughter. Strongly recommend making a reservation for any night, but particularly weekend nights. We were seated quickly upstairs as requested. The waiter took our order quickly, but it was about and hour before the food came. The waiter was great but clearly the kitchen isn't big enough for a full restaurant. Please note, they don't have an English menu, but if you know crepes, you can make do with the French. They do speak enough English to be helpful.The crepes were great. Unusual mix of ingredient options which was very similar to a creperie I tried in France once. Large selection. I had one with egg, mushrooms, ham, spinach. My daughter had a ham and cheese. Perfectly cooked and flavored. We split a couple of dessert crepes which were also delicious but also took a 1/2 hour to get. Definitely a worthy place, but plan carefully if you are with kids."
2,"Had dinner here a few nights ago. Aubergine auflauf was really good, so was the service, but it's a bit crammed and the bare walls make it pretty loud.I don't think you'd be disappointed coming here, but considering it's in a region with a lot of good places I'd look around for another option."
4,"Had the Homemade dumplings--Maultashen, spatzle soup,caraway bread and a chocolate brownie w vanilla ice cream. High quality outstanding meal in a small unassuming setting. Everything homemade.  An outstanding meal."
4,"I'm from Hamburg and I think it was a lot of fun! I saw a lot of people complaining that they didn't understand much when they went there, because it was all in German. Well, I understand that the flyer is in English too, and if you'd do a little bit of research you""d know that they have English tours on Fridays and Saturdays at 10 am.I took my american boyfriend there and he said he had no problem understanding anything and that he loved it. I just wanted to give the tip that they do have english tours, and you can book the tickets online, they are cheaper and you wont have to wait in the cold or outside. When you know the right tricks you wont ever have to wait and it will be great! Also you always have to pay for pictures wherever you go, like in amusement parks, its just a thing to be expected"
3,"I really enjoyed this, geeky as it may be. There's zero hype, and not much education happening. Basically, you're walking on your own through a good portion of a real submarine, free to poke and prod. If that appeals to you, have at it! But take it from me, watch your head. The doors are low at the top, and high at the bottom, and generally have pipes just where you want to stand up after passing through. (Probably not a good outing for a first date.)"
4,"Fresh, high quality seafood.  Intimate sitting for 30 fills the restaurant. Proprietor hands on, serves as host and translator. Backyard party atmosphere, expect to relax and enjoy for hours as late arrivers are served to catch up on the set 4 course meal. Vegetarian service also offered. Guitarist adds to atmosphere. Generous host served special shots as we joined in watching Germany win the FIFA WC! Arriba!"
4,"I love this cafe. When I was there they played great music...David Bowie, some fifties music, some hip hop, very eclectic. They are open late on the weekends and have a full bar. St. Pauli is a nice neighborhood of Hamburg, and this cafe was super cozy. The vibe was very chill, the prices were fair, they had soy (soja) milk. I got the latte macchatio with soy cold and it was delicious. The Wifi is free, the staff is super friendly and young. The atmosphere is hip without being pretentious. I felt very comfy. They also have a lot of local events listed on the walls, and the staff spoke great English as well. Lots of cool german magazines to read. Some outdoor seating as well. And, its was fun to try the 'deathpresso'....Dont miss this spot"
4,"This is a once in a life time experience!That was the best thing i have done in Hamburg since i got here.... Dialog in Dunkel offers you the chance to experience life as a blind person.Depending on the course you choose, you can spend between 1/2 and 1 h (i presume) in complete darkness - dunkel - being guided by a blind person through different rooms. Each room has a different theme, which you explore using your hands and other senses be it hearing or smelling.. you even get to a bar where u need to pay for your drinks this is something everyone in hamburg should do..."
1,I've tried this place twice before writing this review and the jury is out now. It's a great looking cafe inside very inviting with comfy seating big arm chairs and dimmed lighting. The problem is Both times I've been here it's taken them more then 5 mins to come up to me where I'm standing at the bar and take my order.The staff don't seem to care that your a customer or potential customer and yesterday after standing there for over 5 minutes without so much as eye contact from the bar staff I just left as it was getting ridiculous. Disapointing.
1,"I walked past this place a number of times, I've never been bothered to go in but always had an inconscious desire of having a meal here. Maybe what my inconscious was trying to tell me wasn't something like you should try it but, at the contrary, something like leave it. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this place, for two simple reasons: food isn't particularly tasty and it's a bit too expensive (but probably not for the area). Don't really remember much about service or decorations, but honestly who cares if the food isn't good. So the recommendation would be to eat here only if you are really really, really hungry. Too hungry even for a 30 seconds walk to Grindelalle, were you can find something better and cheaper for sure."
2,"Das neue Innen-Design ist cool und modern, ähnelt stark Starbucks. Leider gibt es hier nicht mehr die hintere Sitzecke, in der man sich etwas zurückgezogener unterhalten konnte. Sehr schön finde ich immer die Blumen-Arrangements auf den Tischen! Der Lärmpegel ist wie eh und jeh sehr laut.  Die verschiedenen Kaffee-Spezialitäten (Caramellj, Vanilla Latte etc.) schmecken für mich alle gleich, dafür sind die Baguettes und Surf-Cup-Nudeln sehr lecker!  Für einen kleinen Zwischenstopp zum Füße ausruhen eine gute Wahl mitten in der City."
4,"I fled in here from the rain today, drenched and quite unhappy with the day. Had a breakfast Linz and some absolutely perfect coffee, very quiet today, lovely music, friendly service! Now I'm ready to face the stormy weather again :)"
4,"The niciest coffee shop in Hamburg. Absolutely love it! It's run and decorated with so much care and taste, that it's worth just to go and check it out. And if you'll only see these freshly baked pies, tall and brown, with apples, poppy seeds, blackberries, rhubarb, plums anything you can imagine (depends on the season of course), you know there's no escape! They all stand on the table to tease your gastro-imagination, there are plates and cutlery next to it, whipped cream too, if you want. Of course, white table cloth, beautifull china, classic furniture. Let me tell you more about furniture: the whole place is like a living room of somebody's apartmet. There's wallpaper, paintings and drawings, tiffany lamps, wooden tables and chairs. It's intimate and warm, cosy and classy. It's nice and welcoming atmosphere both in the evnings and at the daytime. There's a garden for warmer parts of the year. There is variety of teas and coffees to go with these fabulous pies. They also serve food. And I heard that sunday brunch is fantastic (that's what I'm gonna check next), just make sure you are early enough!"
4,"Ich war das erste Mal im Locks und war total begeistert. Der Service war erste Klasse und das Essen oberlecker. Es war knacke voll ab 19 Uhr, aber für mich steht fest ... ich weiß, wo ich wieder hin gehe."
3,"Wow.....what an experiance.Crazy place, excellent service (lot of passion) and great food.Reservation recommendet. It was full the whole evening.High noise level.Pizza is the main dish and 90% of all orders.Excellent. However by far not the best in town.Burrata was delicious. Perfect!Clear a place to be if you are close to the harbour."
3,"What a delightful surprise!In a city centre populated by fast food joints, lousy service and that unmissable local ""attitude"" where it seems the customer is there to compliment the establishment and not the other way around, O-ren stands out.The food we ordered did take a long period to prepare, which is usually a good sign and one not to be taken for granted in this town. Finally there, we were all delightfully surprised how crunchy the vegetables were, delectable the meats and fresh the herbs tasted. Only slight drawback is the hectic service which is understandable since we were there during the lunch break. I think it might do the restaurant a world of good if they had more people manning the counters and tables during the prime time hours. Still they were friendly considering the influx of customers and long waiting line at the door. Still, we will definitely be regulars. Thanks for a good time."
4,One of the most beautiful places in this wonderful city.
2,"5EUR entry costcheesy music... the kind of music you'd only expect to hear in german clubsi mean 80s and 90s music mixed with last year's songs and a bit of bob marley then some ABBA.The DJ thinks that by mixing, he's supposed to mix styles and songs...ok you get my point: Music - BADbut at least its full, its funnythere are a lot of people, which means a lot of weird people too. I am not sure id be back... not really my type of club but if u were rejected entry in the other hip clubs, try it out... you'll have a laugh"
4,"This is a great spot to catch a quick lunch. They serve fine cut meats from pork to turkey along with potato and kraut. There's two sizes; small and large at 6,90 and 8,90 euros. Very fair priced. You may sit inside or outside and enjoy your meal. Obviously they are other items on the menu but these are the main attraction in my opinion. Also great, the staff speak both German and English so that made my life easy"
4,"Amazing maritime museum completed in 2008. Extremely comprehensive--  nine stories in all, with sub-floors in-between.  Largest collection of miniature ships ever assembled -- all by the die cast process.  Highlight for me:  Topographic map of the entire planet showing the islands throughout the Pacific -- even Catalina Island.  Topography of South American coastline shows how incredibly deep the drop-off is. The Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas jut out dramatically.  Other highlights:  all types of torpedoes and other naval weaponry.  Also:  WWII periscope -- in working order.  And a huge model of the QE II made out of legos.  I was happier than a pig in sh*t."
4,"A M A Z I N G!Other reviewers have all said it. What I can add is that the world now seems way too big... Details, sense of humor and the massive scale of this miniature world can't be missed. Two hours wasn't enough. Go on a weekday and stay for 3+ hours. Make sure you stand at each station long enough for the daylight / nighttime transitions to occur."
2,"Update: Last time I was here the service was rude and so slow that we had to threaten to leave before we finally got given our tapas. My old score was 5/5. ================== This place is excellent. Best tapas I've had in Hamburg, and I've previously had some pretty good tapas. More food than we could eat + beers for five guys and the bill only came to EUR47(!) Things to definitely order:-the spicy potatoes (10 or 12 on the menu, I forget)-the chorizo (it comes flaming!)-the honey-mustard chicken-the fried cheese & ham thingys (I will learn the name) I'll definitely be back."
3,"Quite a cool place. Very big and bright. Pay around 25 euros (if i remember remember correctly) for an all you can eat buffet with mostly japanese and Chinese food (such as sushi, noodles, duck etc.). Also a section with raw food (meat, fish and veg) for the cooks to cook up in front of you.Generally the food is decent. Gets refreshed every so often and the deserts are different everytime i go there but always tasty (fried banana, cake, fruit plate).Sometimes service is slow, but they do come and refill your empty glass. Cocktail bar in there as well with a separate lounge area. Whiskey sours was good."
4,"What a great spot!!Super atmosphere! Cool people.Great, yummy and sustainable sourced coffee.The waffles were my favorite :)"
3,"Yummy burgers, good fries, nice staff OK prices. I like it here :)"
4,Best sushi ever! Really fresh. The tuna sashimi! Nomnonnomnomnonnomnnmmm! Really nice Staff! It was saterday and nog even half full.. they really not deserve that ! Good price for good  what Else do you want?
2,"It's ok (for a Vietnamese). Good selection, nice ambience and a place you can take your friends to for Vietnamese food. The food is average I would say but value isn't that great. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in town."
0,"I had a ice coffee and I was very disappointed. It did not taste well. The coffee was like water with a bit of coffee taste. Also I did not feel so well afterwards. Maybe it was bad luck, but there are much nicer places."
3,"This is a  fine restaurant. The ambience is classes and I especially love the fact that the coat hangers are right at the table. Although the owner is Turkish he managed to create a really nice environment that actually felt like it were French. My one complaint is our server. It was my grandfathers birthday and what the server did was, that he HANDED the champagne glasses. That's right, he didn't set them down on our table as it's usually done. In addition, he had no clue of what a server is supposed to do. He just stood at our table for two minutes straight before asking us what we would like to order. Anyway the food was fabulous. I had the snails and the Fillet cafe de Paris. It is quite expensive but definitely worth it."
1,"A bland and overpriced chicken curry. A waste of time, money and my appetite. By Hamburg's standards it's not that bad  but it is a very low standard. Must do better Chutney and Hamburg generally."
3,"A very good place for a family meal for four. We came here early on a Saturday night and they were kind enough to find us a table as long we were were done by 8pm. So it's more or less Steak for four with ice-cream afterwards, you know what to expect and there are no real surprises. Nice location, well kept place."
3,"Great vegan restaurant. The food is tasty, the place is cosy and the crew is cool. Best vegan quiche I ever eat !  The blueberry pie is great too.The missing star is for the really slow service : 40 minutes to get my dish."
2,"A typical ice cream shop with a pretty large selection of your basic and expected flavors. It was good, but with so much competition in the area (Eishunger, Cellos...), this would probably be my last pick on Mühlenkamp to get a scoop in the future. If they had more interesting flavors or more attractive prices, then I'd come back!"
2,"The massive Hofbräuhaus on Esplanade seem to aim towards a traditional Bavarian experience. The entire eatery looks to be extremely traditional in terms of interior design and service, the menu selection is mainly Bavarian (with a few other European dishes thrown in for good measure). We were a group of about 10 at lunchtime and had no trouble getting a large table. Service was prompt and the food arrived quickly. The food was satisfying and affordable (some of us had a large schnitzel with fries for 5eu). Very nice, traditional, home-style cooking and all-around a good comfortable place to have lunch in groups of all sizes. Highly recommended! EDIT:It looks like I'm going to have to bring the rating down for this place. During our last visit, service was non-existent despite the restaurant being relatively empty, and the waiter refused to serve me tap water. Refusing to serve tap water is actually against German law, and in general a big no-no - shame on you, Hofbräuhaus."
3,"Ich habe gestern wie immer gutes Sushi bekommen, mussten auch nur kurz warten aber das ist ja kein Problem im jeden anderen Restaurant muss ich auch auf mein Essen warten.  Das nebeneinander sitzen finde ich bei gewissen Nachbarn sogar ganz geil, ich meine die Leute müssen ja auch nicht ihre intimen Pärechengespräche in einem Restaurant führen.  Nur 4 Sterne weil es gestern echt lange gedauert hat bis mal eine andere Sorte Sushi auf dem Band war."
2,"A very good restaurant! Wee bit posh, but I liked it.However within Hamburg competition it's not outstanding.Location: Perfect. The place is located in great place and also inside it's clean, posh and kind of romantic. I liked the music on this Friday evening very much.Food and Drinks: Wine list is average. Nothing really special. Wine quality is very good.Food was my biggest disappointment. The Beef tartar was done in a very unique way. There was a bottom layer of a spicy sauce. Not my style, as it was not possible to taste the tartar itself. Fish for main dish was excellent. However the side dishes (KartoffelSCHAUM) was just marketing. Simply potatoes were served.Service: There is room to improve. Especially with the white wine and how to pour which wine in a glass. I've to admit the young ""main waitress"" was perky in a positive "" Hamburger Deern"" way.  Overall: If you around it's a place to visit and enjoy dinner."
3,"something nostalgic and very Japanese about this place. I figured out after donkeys ears of going to this joint that there is even a karaoke section somewhere in the cellar. you'll find groups of Japanese MIBs in the neighbouring tables which probably means it's not a japeusch concoction their delivering. daruma comes from the Indian word dharma btw. dharma as in dharmic religions Hinduism, Buddhism etc.  it also stands for the cute red paper figure lining the top shelves of this place. albeit a bit dusty. I suspect they haven't been dusted since the 70s. which is also the look and feel of the place BTW. recommend going here for an authentic Japanese experience with a hospitable Japanese family. the man cooks, the woman waits."
3,We were going to the nighttime lights show at Planten un Blomen and walked down the street to look for a nice place to eat. Found several restaurants grouped together on Messeplatz St/Grindelhof. And after looking at Menus we choose this one. Good service and food. Nice atmosphere and not too crowded. I had the sweet curry chicken dish which was amazing and my wife had lamb. They have pizzas also which was an interesting combo but they were excellent. Highly recommend for a nice meal at a reasonable price.
3,"It's difficult to find good Asian restaurants in Germany that try to deliver a food experience close enough to their native kitchen in their homeland. The Quan Do is certainly a recommendation for those who despise the stereo-typical, sweet-sour fast food style pseudo Asian kitchen. The food is fresh, simple and soul soothing. For friends of a good Pho this is a good address. I also like their summer rolls.The staff is always friendly and competent, you can tell they like working there. The place is always crowded and does not take reservations, so at peak times you need to calculate some waiting time to be seated. The Quan Do is not a suitable choice if you're in a hurry to grab a lunch for example during your work break.The Quan Do is also nicely decorated with Vietnamese lamps hanging from the ceiling and nice photography of Vietnamese street scenes.I would grant a fifth star if the food was even more authentic to the taste in Vietnam or ethnic tribe area of South China, bordering Vietnam."
4,"So delicious!! The place has a great cozy atmosphere! Not sure if they take reservations as we walked in around dinner time and managed to get a table for 4 without waiting, but the place is packed! For cocktails, they make great Moscow mules and spicy mules so I highly recommend these to start!For our appetizer we shared the fried spring rolls which came out piping hot to our table! One order comes with 4 rolls so we each had one which was perfect!For my entree, I went with the dry noodle/salad bowl with beef. I don't remember the proper name of it but it was really delicious. The portion was a pretty good size but I could have eaten more....It's ok though as we ordered another round of drinks so that satisfied my appetite :)Will definitely return soon to try everything else on the menu!!"
0,"This restaurant has the distinction of having the rudest waiters I've ever encountered in a life of eating and traveling. I lived above this restaurant for six weks and ate there only once, my first night in Hamburg. I went in alone after having slept all day following an exhausting trip. I walked in, slightly disoriented because I expected something different than the nice surroundings. A  waiter with an overly-tailored beard approached me in English and gruffly asked me if I wanted to eat inside or out. I apparently took a few seconds too long to decide and exasperated him. ""Inside or out?"" he demanded. Only because I was famished and still exhausted did I stay. I sat in a secluded corner and was ignored for fifteen minutes, then requested service from another waiter who was busy doing something behind the bar. I wasn't happy, but too tired to leave. No takeout. Great. He then felt it necessary to lecture me that I wasn't in America when I simply offered a curious comparison to the size of the coffee cup presented. He eventually lightened up and complained that I tipped him too much. (I kept getting conflicting information about tipping in Germany). The owner did come over and ask if I liked the meal. It was just okay, but I said it was very good, other customers seemed to be having a good time. This wasn't enough. He looked at me for a moment (the stare) and didn't say anything else, then turned and left. They had an inflated opinion of the restaurant and of themselves, an arrogance similar to what I encountered often in Hamburg, but nowhere else in my travels throughout Germany and Paris this past summer. A sweet young lady smiled and said goodbye as I left, as the first waiter tried to make a point of ignoring me as he dried a plate. I really wished I had had dealings with her instead of these arrogant fools. This experience was so surprising because I had just stayed a week and a half at the Hotel  Kempinsky in Berlin where I experienced, with one exception, nothing but the absolute best service, most professional demeanors, and genuine smiles at all times."
4,Super cute and fantastic coffee. The bagel sandwiches were delicious and the staff is so friendly. I love this place.
4,"Ham-Burgers in Hamburg Germany yes please! Especially if it here. This place has burger flavors to try more than once. Lunch time was a bit busy but rightfully so for good food.i chose the baked potato instead of fries and I'm glad I did. If anything I would just go for that and a burger on the side.  While I'm not a salad eater they do make them fresh right in front of you and the portion is large. And as delicious as they looked I would even eat one. Who doesn't want burgers and beer. Well you can get both here, enjoy a table outside and people watch as they pass in a hurry to get to their next destination.  My husband upgraded his champion burger and it was far better than my own. They also offer no bun options and a blue cheese burger that I heard was really good too.  What seems to be a chain restaurant or fast food was not like anything I'm use to in the US.  I would definitely go back. The cashiers were friendly and informative and offered a smile with every meal purchase. But don't expect fast food service if they are busy everything is made to order. But for me that is worth the wait."
0,"I have never before in my life returned sushi to the chef, until my unfortunate encounter at Sushi Circle. I payed for an all-you-can-eat as a recommendation from a friend, and ended up having half a piece of nigiri, and asking for my money back. Up until this point, I must have eaten at about a hundred some-odd Sushi eateries - only a trickle served worse Sushi and provided a worse experience than at Sushi Circle. I have not grown up in a culture which serves sushi as a cultural thing (Read: I am not Japanese) but would like to be able to say that I have had enough experience with Sushi to be able to note when it's well made, or the product of ""Raw fish slackery"". I fear ""Sushi Circle"" falls into the latter category. To avoid rambling on in generic terms, here's what I didn't like about Sushi Circle's sushi experience: - The Rice/Vinegar ratio. The rice was tasteless, non-sticky, and the nigiri was falling apart. - The fish.With fresh fish, my teeth sink into the sushi. With this stuff, I needed to put up a fight. - The service.If I ask for nigiri without wassabi wedged between the rice and the fish, do I have to wait half an hour? - The selection. ""All you can eat"" rounds are not always known for their marvelous selection, but having 4 types of sushi on the conveyor belt is rather poor. - The seating.Sushi circle's establishment is built in such a way where you need to squirm and crawl to get out of your seat, or to allow others to pass by you. Very disappointed and will not return under any circumstances."
4,It's a little hidden place where you will find great and affordable meals. Even in the middle of the night you'll receive lovingly crafted vegetarian food. You can also rent the place for your personal events.
4,"After getting a late start in finding a place for dinner, very few restaurants were still open. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we discovered wonderful Cappricio. Very nice house wine, excellent Caprese salad, amazing truffle linguine and a beautiful chocolate mousse dessert made for a memorable meal. But the star of the evening was the service. Friendly, attentive and helpful. Definitely will come back."
2,"This basic place across the street from Central Station is frequented by many Asians, which I would assume speaks for some authenticity.I was here for a late lunch - a roughly 10-11€ affair when you include a small drink. The spring roll I got was burnt and tasteless. The main dish was a little better, still unremarkable.At the lunch rate it beats all options at the station itself, but I would not have liked to pay dinner prices for this quality. If you like Indian food too, you'll probably have a better time at Badshah just a few houses up the street."
2,"I've had lunch here a few times and to be honest it is not my cup of tea. It is a cool place to have lunch, considering you are eating inside the Rathaus. The food is not horrible but it wasn't memorable in a good way either. I had the Currywurst last time and the sauce was horrible. The texture was like sand, it was bitter, not spicy in least, and plain just tasted bad. The fries were also a bit bland which is surprising since they are fries. I mean how hard is it to screw up fries? The other times I have been here it was for a ""party"". They cleared out the entire place and changed it into a club. They always seemed to have great DJs at those events as well. The price is not the cheapest by any means so bring your money and lots of it."
3,"Amazing cute little restaurant. Ordered the meatballs, two different salads, hotdogs and the chocolate dessert. All really fantastic dishes with great flavors. Ambiance is great very Scandinavian with a ton of personality. There's big common tables, chairs, chandeliers and smaller wood tables for more intimates dinners. Overall this is a great place to have pleasant lunch or dinner."
3,Amazing views of the Alster while sitting down on a fun lounge chair. They even provide you with blankets so it feels nice and cozy like you are at home. The view is fantastic! They have a nice drink selection but not sure how the food is! I would recommend this place for drinks and just hanging out.
4,"Alright... we knew this was the best always !!!Superb hospitality. Huge ballrooms and excellent catering. We had a fine experience visiting the interiors, not to forget the Phantom Room- where all the history of this hotel lies.. its my favorite...all time !!!"
4,"A Kebab joint unlike any other I've encountered setting a whole new bench mark as far as kebab shops go Firstly a proper dine in Kebab shop?! Unreal! Being use to ordering my Kebab from a corner stall after a big night out, consuming the contents either on a street bench or as I walk home, this place resembles more of a comfortable Turkish bar/cafe then any kebab shop back in Sydney.The place obviously has quite a following with it's tables still full and lively even on a late Tuesday night. The servings are huge and very tasty!!! Ordering a small plate delivered enough food to comprise three meals for me let alone one! The highlight for me was being able to order a nice cold one with my meal-The fact that I can now enjoy both a Beer and a Kebab simultaneously and at the beginning of a night out rather then as the end of a big one has definitely secured a loyal customer out of me A Kebab shop that serves Beer is just plain genius!! If only they did this in Australia."
3,"I ate here a few nights ago (on a Saturday) we were lucky to be able to reserve a table - booking is highly recommended. We visited for the traditional Bavarian experience, we weren't disappointed. Drinking litre beers from steins and feeding on schnitzels (huge) the evening ended watching the traditional Bavarian band and sinking a few shots of Jagermeister. Great way of experiencing the Munich beer houses in Hamburg."
4,"Charming space. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Warm and welcoming. Efficient service. Fantastic seafood. Great drinks. Reasonably priced. Classy, but not at all stuffy. The Labskaus was excellent. It's kind of like a seafood tartare. Lovely. Excellent soups and sauces. Highly recommended. Would definitely return."
3,"Once in a while, one simply wants a good steak. After being a vegetarian for a year (and previously spending my time with either fellow vegetarians or kosher-keepers), I had very little experience with Hamburg's selection of meat. After much deliberation, our party of three decided to forego the ide of an upscale steak joint for Hopi - a much recommended, affordable steakhouse in Hoheluft-Ost/Harvestehude. Service was a bit slow to start with, but our meals arrived quickly. I had a ""Hopi Steak"", which was 8.90 for a 200g argentinian beef steak, a baked potato and a piece of garlic bread. The meat was okay - a solid slab of beef, but nothing exceptional. I found it very ""gummy"", hard to cut and chew. I'm not a meat connoisseur, so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about. I finished the meal off with a very yummy tartufo. Overall, I had a good, solid experience at Hopi and I'll be glad to come back. The worth for money is quite good, I'd recommend this for anyone who'd like a laid-back steak dinner in the neighborhood at an affordable price. For me, my quest for a really great steak continues."
1,"The service is friendly but extremely slow. Waited 40min for an order that arrived incomplete. The quality is ok, but the food is overpriced. If you have time, patience and no other choice go for it, otherwise I would skip."
4,"superb food, superb choice, reasonable prices. nice that they serve with tea and chips while you wait to pick up a take away order."
4,"Most favorite Italian in Hamburg. Try the Vitello Tonnato- amazing, and the pizza's are delicious! When the meal is coming to an end- be ready for a couple bottles and shot glasses to appear at your table with a friendly smile... The owners/servers know how to party and love making you feel like you're in their own home!"
4,"Amazing mostly-vegetarian food, in a elegant yet comfortable setting.  Basically, my ideal dinner party.I had the risotto with Provence herbs and veggies (zucchini was the most memorable); creamy and cheesy, but still firm and not overcooked.  Feels like they might have a copy of the Moosewood cookbook, or something similar.I picked up the peanut and pepper soup and bread as a side --- again, immediately reminded me of the Moosewood.  The soup was savory, and the bread was fluffy but still hearty.The owner wasn't impressed by my first guess at a wine, and steered me towards a grechetto which better matched the risotto; I'm fine taking advice from someone who knows wine better, but there was definitely some steering.For dessert, I got the crème catalan --- a cinnamon version of a crème brûlée.  Tasty, but a bit puddinglike for my taste, and I would have been happy with half a serving.Many of the other reviews describe it as a vegetarian restaurant, but it does serve a few meat specialties like jamón serrano.Piccolo Paradiso serves the food I cook for myself --- and they do it better than I do."
4,"We lived in Hamburg for two years, and I think I ate at Jimmy Elsass no fewer than 100 times. A real locals kinda vibe, it's a great spot to bring your visiting friends. The atmosphere is perfection. The flamkuchen, and this cannot be overstated, is mind blowing. I have been back in California for 5 years and I still dream about Jimmy Elsass."
4,"Unglaublich gute Sushi, sogar das vegetarische Sushi mit den 3-4 Stücken tempura-Gemüse finde ich zum niederknien (in anderen Restaurants sind das oft nur Gurkenmaki, die man am liebsten vergessen möchte) Vorweg gab es eine ganz schlicht aussehende gemüsebrühe mit lachsstückchen. Selbst die war ein Gedicht. Mein neuer lieblingsasiate."
4,"Busy meat lovers restaurant, good atmosphere, friendly service. Quite expensive but worth the money as the steak is good quality, you can even watch them cook your steak for you! Jacket (Baked potato) is served with steaks and is very tasty!"
4,"The Bird could use a little more atmosphere, but it's early days and the food and the staff are just so awesome, it deserves the full five stars. Sadly though I think the sheer class of the Bird is a bit wasted on the Hamburgers, with their naff Croques and Jim Blocks. This is greasy, hearty Americana at it's best. Spread the word."
4,Wir waren erneut zum Frühstück unter der Woche dort. Sehr hochwertige Speisen auf wirklich schön angerichteten Tellern  und ausreichend war es auch. Wir kommen wieder.
4,A great place for a peaceful walk away from the main roads. There is also a dear sanctuary in the park. Ideal place also for running or walking the dog.
4,"Dafür 5 Sterne! In diesem Wohnzimmer gibts nur Basics zu trinken. Aber mit diesen Basics wirst Du zu 100% glücklich. Hier gibts die tollsten Sofas, die nettesten Bedienungen, die abgefahrensten Einrichtungsgegenstände und die hübschesten Mädchen. Was willst Du mehr? Ne? Also, dafür 5 Sterne!"
4,Must see place in Hamburg! I have been here many years ago when I was little and I loved it and now grow up I saw how even more amazing this is. They are making more and more new exibitions and you dont need to be child to enjoy the plesure of this place ;)
4,"This place is amazing! Such great food! Decent price and great service, what more could you ask for?I came in on a slow night and the waiter gave me a free shot on the house. Not to mention the food was out of this world!"
4,"Such delicious and fresh food, open late which is a bonus. The beef burritos we ordered were very generous in size and as good as anything we've had at home, staff are extra friendly and happy to answer any questions (our German is awful and they didn't mind switching to English to help us order) plenty of tasty vegetarian options too!"
4,"The food is very fresh at a really good price. But the best part is the service. Good wines, clean and easy to get there.It is better to make reservations because the place is very small.Everybody is very friendly. Highly recommended."
4,"A very nice hidden cafe;  if you're somewhere around you should definitely visit and sit outside! (As long as the weather allows that is). I enjoy their quiche and breakfast menus, their friendly staff  and good service"
4,Pretty cool  spot for having cocktails  and wine  with a lot of people. Seems to be a place to be for a night out !
1,"I went a Sunday night with a friend. The place is nice and the sofas very comfortable. The service on the other hand was bad. I took a Mojito that was OK. My friend a virgin cocktail, but the fruit wasn't fresh. It was evident that was made from a juice box out of fridge. In addition, we had to pay straight away... It is a pity - very nice place with bad service"
4,In my opinion this is the best Italian restaurant in Hamburg! The food is authentic and absolutely delicious. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home. I enjoyed our lunch there and will definitely come again. Highly recommendable!
2,"Too big and noisy restaurant . Waiter was cool and friendly. Not knowing in advance it was mainly known for meat dishes , I took fish dish , was really good. Would not return because of loud atmosphere, could not hear even myself ."
1,"Location is nice but the lady who served us was very unprofessional and hostile.The manor in which the order was taken made us feel unwelcome. Some of our orders came out wrong and she argued with us instead of offering to fix it.The food was fine but not worth dealing with this particular member of staff.Very disappointed with the service, I can not recommend."
4,"After going there for few years, I have to admit that, this is a decent place to go for Chinese - Taiwanese ( southern homemade food style) place. It is not a place for spicy food ---  there are large group of Chinese who don't eat Spicy food !!! :) It is more southern style --- definitely! the Good thing is: when there is a big travel group eating at the back, you will have a chance to order those ""long time prepared "" dish !!! I will come for sure again ;)"
2,"This place has 4.5 stars with the most reviews(over 1500) compared to all other vietnamese restaurants in the area based on google. So coming here from orange county I am on a hunt for good vietnamese food to prepare for the future homesickness. First impression: spacious seating area. Self seated. Line moves decently quick. Ordering food with Vietnamese worked for me since I don't speak German and lady waitress doesn't seem to know English. She came about 2 minutes after I found myself a seat. Very attentive. I got a pho bò since....what else is there to eat on a gloomy day at a vietnamese place. To be honest I was disappointed because I didn't taste beef broth I was expecting. More seasoned boiled water than broth. Noodles were not boiled soft enough for my taste but I understand that some people do prefer that over soft fresh noodles. Pho didn't come with fresh herbs on the side like usual so I was bummed out as well. I love bean sprouts in my pho. Overall, this is a place to go to if you work around the area and need a quick lunch. I don't hate it but didn't love it either. Maybe there are other items on the menu that could be a hit."
3,"Proper Irish pub. Went there once with a friend, had light snack and guinness. Beer is fantastic but food is bit too heavy. Place is quite small and dark but have good atmosphere and sometimes live Irish music."
3,"I believe this was the first burger joint we dined at in Hamburg and it is still one of my favorites. Yes, the burgers are hard to eat because the patty is shaped pretty much like a baseball and everything is contained between two small english muffins. But everything I've ordered here has been delicious and satisfying. The fries have that homemade quality and you get a lot of it. If you still have room after the giant plate of burger and fries, you have to have the cheese cake, self-proclaimed as the best cheese cake in the world. I believe it! The staff is nice and friendly. Always a good time and delicious food to be had here."
3,"This is my first Vietnamese restaurant in Germany. It's a cute little restaurant with outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has metal dinning tables with small plastic stools reminiscent of restaurants in Vietnam (which I have just spent 3 weeks in prior to coming to Germany). The green tea is the traditional Vietnamese green tea that I love. I also had the shrimp spring rolls (summer rolls) that came with a fish sauce dipping sauce. The inside is filled with veggies and the very thin vermicelli noodles. Very tasty. I also had the beef pho. The usual hoisin sauce and the plate of vegetables on the side was not served with it like I am used to in other countries (US, Vietnam, etc) but the broth is very flavorful you almost don't need it. The beef is served medium rare over the boiling hot soup. It was kind of chewy but overall still good."
3,"I liked this bar, a quiet (ish) place to meet and chat to friends whilst enjoying a drink on the many sofas. Cool mix of all types of people, with the bar staff being friendly and proffessional (one having the nicest haircut my girlfriend had ever seen - what this has to do with a review I have no idea). Good cheap drinks and the only place I have found that has the perfect music levels. You can still talk without shouting, listen to the music, without it being overbearing and relax and enjoy yourself. However, like Laurisija said, its not THE reason to go out, but its a nice place to meet before heading off somewhere else, or just to chat to friends during the week."
3,This is a really nice restaurant! Really relaxing and enjoyable. I ordered a sandwich with pesto and it was really good!
3,If you order the Bio-Wuchtbrumme mit Grillgold you will receive a piece of organic meat soaked in a reddish curry dip served with french fries. - Go for it!
4,"Unbelievable, this place has a name! Thanks Kittles! The Sofabar was one of the first bars I visited when I came to Germany, and remains one of my favorite evening locales (during that dead hour after the evening is over but night hasn't begun yet). While the place is mostly packed, the Sofabar is always cozy, comfortable and inviting. Furnished with 20-odd sofas, the Sofabar is great for couples, but especiallyfor groups of 5 or more - this makes the Sofabar a great spot for birthdays! The Sofabar is one of Hamburg's most unique locales and a must-visit for those wanting to try out something different than the traditional bartop."
2,"Not bad! Ok, I had a pretty good time here. The drinks are pretty cheap and from what I can remember, the strawberry daquiri was really good! This is more of a dive bar and get shitfaced kind of place. The music was loud but not too loud thank god. I would probably come back."
4,The most beautiful building of old classic architecture in Hamburg. The Rathaus building was once described to me that it is so impressive because it is reflecting the self confidence of the Hamburgers and their love for the city. It think that is a pretty good description. :)
2,"I don't normally go out for asian food (apart from sushi) since it has a tendency to either be meat-based or spicy (none of which I eat), but decided to take a shot at joining my coworkers for lunch here. I had the saitan dish - not that I had any choice whatsoever as it was the only vegetarian dish on the menu. The waitress warned me that it would have a ""basic spiciness"" but seeing as it was either that dish or no dish, I ordered it anyway. HOLY MOTHER JESUS OF NAZERETH THIS THING WAS SPICY. And delicious. And spicy. Too spicy. I couldn't finish my meal - had to run over to the bakery to pick up an egg sandwich instead. Have IBS like me? Don't go here."
3,Found this charming place (by smell) on the way to the Warehouse district. I was SO bummed that I wasn't able to snag an English tour.  Why isn't this place on the trip advisor list - it's a total must do!  Who doesn't want a chocolate tour?!!! The shop is FULL of delicious chocolates made in-house and from around the world.  Definitely pick up some decadent chocolates! The ladies at the register are darling.
3,"We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1:30. The restaurant was mostly empty except for one other table, but there are two small dining rooms, so it didn't feel too desolate.We ordered the lentil soup, the paneer pakoras, the mango curry with vegetarian meatballs, and the chicken biryani. The waiter was very patient with our German pronunciation of Hindu(?) words, and mostly ended up writing down the numbers of the dishes, so you can save yourself the trouble by just giving them the dish numbers.The food was quite good. We had some pappadams with a few tasty chutneys at the beginning (this is free/included). The lentil soup was really flavorful and had some fresh herbs on top that made it delicious. The mango curry was also quite good, with a very strong cardamom flavor (which my wife was into, but was a bit much for me), and served with a side of rice. The chicken biryani was a bit mixed for me. The chicken was boneless (I would have preferred the bones), but cooked to perfection. The rice included a tremendous amount of vegetables (zucchini, cauliflower, green beans, more than I've ever seen in a biryani), and was highly sauced, perhaps too much. It was a tremendous amount of food; easily twice as much as I could eat.The prices are higher than I would have expected (approx 5 euro for soup, 13 euro for curry, 15 euro for biryani), but it was a lot of food, and we ended up bringing some home. I'll come again sometime, but only when I'm really hungry."
3,"Moraba is a nice bar in the schanze. Not particularly special, but certainly gets most things right. I guess the reason that I'm so blasé is because after you've been to one, you've sort of been to most of the bars in the area - they are all good, but not many stand out."
2,"I dig Burgerlich for the very novel ordering system. If you sit inside, every seat has its own pop-up order screen. If you're not native German speakers like we are, this is a super easy way to order. All items on the menu have correlating pictures so you know exactly what you're getting. We both ordered the cheeseburger, mine with a fried egg and his with bacon. We also ordered a side salad and onion rings. The food came out fast! I was impressed. The burger itself tasted OK. The patty was maybe a little too bland for my taste. I did very much like the tomato relish spread on the bottom bun. I would've wanted extra of that. The brioche bun was also rather awesome. It held the burger together very well. The salad was nothing special, but we did really like the onion rings. The batter was super crispy and I enjoyed the touch of rosemary in the batter.This is a great place for a quick burger fix and to bring a big group of people. Everyone can easily order what they want and pay individually since you pay up front with a card that you use to scan in your order. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the place itself is a really cool looking spot. Though the burgers aren't the best I've had, I would come back with friends in tow."
3,"Immense burgers here in Hamburg. Well worth the hunt to find the place (middle of a housing estate near St Pauli) for the reward of a super tasty patty.The muffin bun is a bit out of the ordinary, but it does work quite well. The chips are very good too, however the portion size is BARBARIC. have a look at the photo I posted. It's enormous.A great place and some really good craft beer options, again which is usually difficult to find in Hamburg."
3,Good food! And you can smoke in the restaurant inside only tell the owner you're wife or your sister is having a child in the hospital then it's ok
4,"I am going to go ahead and give this place five stars. I'd be tempted to dock them one star due to the exorbitant pricing but to be honest, it's almost worth it. Yes, they are expensive and even more importantly, yes you knew this coming here. If you really think you are going to see this menu and not find it expensive then you shouldn't be here in the first place.Now, on to the food. Great, great steaks. Presented as steaks should be.....raw and on a platter for you to choose your cut. I had the ribeye (400g) which had a perfect blend of fat and meat and ordered it medium rare as quality meat should be cooked. Perfect.....not one complaint and I finished almost every last scrap of this cut, which very smartly came out on a hot plate......dislike when they don't do this with larger cuts as it cools off too quickly before you can finish it. The sides were just as good. We had the spinach, the beans with bacon and the steamed vegetables. Perfect.....everything just as I like it.Service is also top notch. We did seem to constantly have different people coming to the table...one for orders of starters, one for the order of drinks (bottles of wine in our case), one who brought the first course and so forth. Yet, everyone was super nice. Really liked this.One side note......and this is not meant negatively. I ordered some barbecue sauce to try it with the meat. This barbecue sauce was horrendous. I absolutely hated it. Yet, it doesn't mean it was bad. It just wasn't my style and I talked with the guy who seems to run this place about this. I very clearly told him I hated it but it didn't interfere with my meal at all. I was lucky I didn't pour it over my steak. One tip: simply keep the sauces on the side and try them before drenching your steak in them. You may love them. I didn't.Finally, if someone isn't going to eat steaks don't come here with them. My g/f for example doesn't eat steaks. Hence she won't be seeing the inside of Butchers. Don't get me wrong....I'd love to take her here but it's a waste. If someone isn't into meat, leave them at home and come here with your buddies......or preferably invited by someone with an expense account (as was my case!)"
3,"Very friendly waiters and pleasant atmosphere. Some Dim Sum were tasty, some you need to get used to. But if you didn't try out Dim Sum before, this place should be a good start."
2,"This is a good place for lunch if you're looking for something on the healthy side. If I were vegetarian, I would probably eat here a lot. The food isn't strictly vegetarian, but most of the dishes are, or at least lean in that direction (meat as an accompaniment, rather than the main event).I've tried their pasta (I think it was gnocchi), and their sweet potato curry (with chickpeas). Both dishes were filling but not exactly bursting with flavor. The rice that came with my curry had been par-boiled, and then boiled again just before serving, but apparently not enough because it was still a little too chewy.On the plus side, food is served cafeteria-style, so you can get in and out quickly, and you can see what you're getting.Not my favorite place for lunch, but not terrible, either."
3,"Very fun to visit and a cool art experience, but very tiring! I love art, but without a guide or audio guide I had no natural path to follow. I ended up viewing only a portion of the art works before we all grew tired. The cafe was inexpensive and served delicious cake For future visitors who also prefer not having a guide, I recommend using a map or consulting with the staff before you embargo on the journey. Altogether the museum is breathtaking, and worth the visit."
3,"Very good value with their 'all you can eat' deal. Tasty, not the best in town but fairly good. Went there with my stepson who very kindly invited me. We had white wine which was nice. Nice place, worth it. We'll go back there."
3,"The best burgers in town! I love me a cheeseburger on most occasions, but save my visits to fast food joints as last resorts. Somewhere, between 1eu McDonald's burgers and 7eu beef monsters from Oma's are the Jim Block burgers - fresh, affordable, quick and really really tasty - on a a plate with a knife and fork. A burger will set you back between 3-5 euros, depending on the size (regular vs. ""Jim Block burger"" or something of the sort). Expect to stand in line quite a bit during the evenings, and try to get one of your party to physically reserve seats for you while you're ordering, otherwise you'll be eating standing up. Well recommended for a quick dinner minus the junkfood guilt."
0,Service is very slow. Took us over two hours since we sat down to finally get our food. Unbelievable. This is on a Tuesday night. Food was mediocre at best. Will not return.
3,"Excellent metaxa-giro, the fries are great as well"
3,"This museum was so close to our hotel that we decided to check it out first thing in the morning.  We were not necessarily looking for anything specific but also wanted to see what they had to offer.  One of the special exhibits was all about video/computer games and it was so cool!  You get to play arcade/console/computer games that you haven't even thought about for years (or maybe you have).  I am so glad I stopped in for that alone.  The rest of the museum is ok, and will be especially interesting to you if you are more into furniture and design.  If you are looking for more art, check out some other spots around the city first."
4,it was GREAT! There is no Menü. You get a three course meal of Fish and Shrimps. what ever the boss bought on the Fish market fir the Day. The Boss cooks himself. If you like Fish you have to visit this Place.
3,"If you are in any kind of hurry, just go ahead and avoid this place. We had all the time in the world on Sunday morning so were okay with food taking quite some time. It's a neat little breakfast joint that reminds me of several places we've gone to and loved back in the States. We both got the 3-egg scramble with toast and home fries. My husband got tomatoes, mozz, spinach and mushrooms and I got sun-dried tomatoes, feta and spinach in mine and we both loved our dishes. Kinda nice that you can get as many veggies inside as you want! The jam served with the toast was delicious, as were the home fries. It was nice to see a menu with eggs different ways (especially eggs Benedict!). I don't even know the last time I had fresh OJ, so that was also a pleasant surprise! We both said we would come back here and recommend it to others, as well."
2,"Boyfriend and I are from America visiting Hamburg - If you're looking for something fast, cheap, and decent (taste wise) then this is a good spot. The food is definitely filling. We got the chicken durum. It wasn't anything to write home about...given the fact that we didn't have time, we wanted something quick. Would I go back again? Only if I was in a time crunch and needed to eat something quick and not to mention really cheap too! Not my favorite but not bad either. Also, not sure the customs in the area, but the same person that prepared our sandwich (without gloves) also handled our money and gave us change back without cleaning hands."
2,i tasted the pho ga and the bun bo. what can i say... it was decent food but nothing that really excited me.
4,"Went there with my boyfriend for our first night in Hamburg! Both of us started with a soup and then we had the seitan-Gyros plate which was delicious! The waiter was really nice too! For two soups, two gyros and a bottle of water we paid 53€, which is a bit on the pricier side but I would still highly recommend it!"
4,"This is my local Starbucks, practically across the street from my office. Starbucks...you know it. What should I write? If you like it, great. If not, go find something else. There's plenty of better cafes (in regards to taste of coffee) in Hamburg. At the same time, I get my wLAN here and can work well from the location. Plus it's definately one of the nicer Starbucks when it comes to interior. Don't forget to look up when ordering."
0,"I won't recommend this place to anyone, who likes to eat authentic Indian food the way it is. We have ordered mango lassi, sweet lassi, chicken tikka musallam and chicken reshmi kebab. All of them were equally bad."
0,"Never go to this place! It's seedy and very unfriendly. Not to mention that the meat is unhealthy. First I couldn't understand why they got so many positive reviews but then I realized that it is owned by a turkish organization that supports Erdogan and some strange (terror?) groups, which, on the other hand, support them by giving positive reviews."
3,I have a great liking for Chinese food that's why i was drawn to this place. This place kept its word. The food especially the Sezuan beef soup was mind-blowing.
4,"We were five in a group, everybody liked it, including picky German colleagues and as well picky Chinese. i am not in the position to compare it with other vegetarian restaurants, since i do not have many experiences. But as a restaurant, it is rather good. The sauce for rice, salad was made with care and delicacyyou can taste it! The price is in a budget-middle range, i just shortly glimpsed through the menu, many dishes cost around 11-14 Euro.Will definitely go there more often."
4,Found the Bistro as I was walking around and I am so glad I stopped in as the service was fabulous!! I had the Hambourgeouise tartine and it was amazing!!!
4,"If you're a fan of Willy Wonka and eating chocolate, then this is the place for you in Hamburg, Germany!   Upon entering the Chocoversum, you immediately notice a very handsome chocolate shop with plenty of room for gathering large groups before the tour.  I went with my family and we were able to get a group rate, which was good with several adults and children.  I highly advise scheduling a tour in advance, and if you need an English speaking guide, make sure to requests this well beforehand.  Tours here are generally conducted in German, so take note of this.  The tour begins with an amazing milk chocolate fountain.  It is literally about five feet tall and has spouts on the side where you can sample as much as you want with a wafer cookie.  From there you'll get a full explanation of the history and cultures of chocolate.  The different regions, countries, and continents that produce chocolate are fairly well represented with maps, and written materials. If you are a chocoholic, you will be jumping for joy as you enter the production room.  This is the place where you'll be able to make your own customized chocolate bar, complete with over a dozen toppings ranging from marshmallows to raisins and gummy bears!  Make sure to specify whether you'd like to make a milk or dark chocolate bar, as the tour guide will pour a fresh one in a mold for you.  After you've made your own chocolate bar, you'll then proceed to additional displays of how the actual chocolate is made, along with a variety of machines involved in process.  The offer a couple of additional samples for tasting from the machines and end with a small package piece you can take home with you. As you exit the tour, you'll enter in the showroom with plenty of options to buy souvenirs, gifts, and additional chocolates.  Enjoy!"
4,Great little place in Hafencity. Great food and great service. Nice place to sit outside on a sunny day with a glass of beer and watch the ships go by. Inside space is very limited.
4,"Wonna try good Hamburg fish...?? You can't miss Fisch & Co.! Really cozy restaurant (with just 3 tables) that prepares fresh fish on-the-fly. Dishes are delicious...I suggest to give a try at fish and chips...the best that I took in my life! Please note that the restaurant is really small. On rainy days it's really hard to get a seat, so good for takeaways, but not for long seating lunches..."
3,"Very nice service, nice setting, nice german fare and (what appears to be) local clientele. Liked it."
4,"One of my 'locals' anytime of the year. As a non-meat eater, I can't comment on the 'Haxe' or even the fish, but the appetizers are great, and never cease to satisfy. With a bottle of retsina and an ouzo or two, a meal at Nostalgia is always worthwhile."
4,"Omg I love their non-alcoholic cocktails! The best I ever have had and I will never forget the 'summer love' (yogurt, mango, white chocolate syrup, maracuja and cranberry juice) and 'kiwi twist virgin' which was pretty sweet but sooo tasty. Their food is amazing as well and I will definitely come back again in their happy hours because the drinks are big and affordable!Venue:Great for groups but it's pretty loud after working hours!  Loud, mainstream club music and a weird mixture of business ppl and youngsters. Not really a restaurant but a nice place to have drinks before you go clubbing!"
4,"I'm so glad I found this place!One cold, sunny Sunday I was in the mood for a walk along the river, some hearty soup, and a peaceful place to read my book. Then up pops coffee al volo on my Yelp page, as if it were meant to be. For me, this cafe has all the comforts of home. The staff are warm and friendly, the food is made with love, and you don't feel guilty for staying for a couple hours to read, chat, or study. Each time I've gone I've seen people there with friends, family, or by themselves; enjoying each other's company or catching up on some work. Overall it has a very welcoming, open, and comfy vibe. As much as I love exploring cafes around the city, I've also been searching for my go-to, all-in-one cafe. Finally, I think I've found it! Definitely becoming one of my weekend staples."
3,Sausalitos in Hamburg is situated in Chilehaus which is a very nice old office building. I have heard of Sausalitos from friends in other German cities. We tried some of the cocktails and finger-food. It was pretty good. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the waitresses were nice. Sausalitos is definitely worth a try.
3,"It's always nice to chase away the daily routine at Café du Passage in Winterhude. It's like a little hideout with its friendly staff and the nice food & bev. You can get anything from breakfast over quiche to cakes and it's all yummy, promised.As a plus there's a vast selection of tea available, too.Prices are fine and so is the interior. It's just set up with heart and soul. You can nearly feel it.It's just lovely to sit (inside or outside) there and goggle at the passersby. Alternatively you can read magazines and books if you feel like wanting a quiet time to yourself.Once you were lucky enough to find this little jewel I bet you will keep coming back again and again and again and again"
4,"Short version: I love eating at Dean & DavidLong version: I am the biggest lover of meat and cheese so when My doctor said I needed to change my diet I was Glum, I thought you couldn't get nice food that was not full crap.  My girlfriend and I started looking for nice places that were a bit healthier and Dean & David hits the mark perfectly.I am a major fan of the Warm Thai Beef Salad and my girlfriend particularly likes the Parisian Salad, both of us are working through the juices and I am a particular fan of the Ginger Shot although it is not quite as tangy as the ginger juices we make at home.It is very helpful that this store is just round the corner from my work for grabbing something quick but seating space is a little short here and for that reason I prefer here when passing or grabbing a quick something but the one on Georgsplatz 10 when we will sit a while and take our time to eat."
2,"Well , just had a falafel here once for 3,50 , not great ,but a great place when ur hungry and your pocket is tight"
2,"Though the burgers are a bit expensive, they are a joy to bite into when you are craving a burger similar to something you would find in the US.  Their burger sauce is pretty good, and everything is fresh and made to order.  Another downside to it being a bit expensive, is your not full after one burger."
4,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and wanted to eat some decent Italian food before the flight. To get here we had to walk 30 minutes, and the weather outside was cold. However, all effort paid back when we got there.First the ambiance - it is a beautiful small restaurant, was not crowded that evening. They are dog-friendly, so they let us in with the dog, gave her some water, and let is pick the table we wanted.Now comes central part - food. We'be ordered pasta with cheese and ham. They clocked it very fast, and as the kitchen was nearby, the smell was impressive and stunning. When they brought us the dishes, pasta was hot, and the sauce was still boiling, this cheesy flavor that burns your mouth a bit but still tastes so delicious. Should I say that after that dinner we both were full and happily walked back to the hotel for 30 minutes!? Highly recommended, even if you need to put some effort to get there."
4,"The ""transparent bakery"" (Gläserne Bäckerei) is a bakery located conveniently next to ""Planten und Blomen"" (plantenunblomen.hamburg.… ) and the Dammtor train station. It is run by Effenberger (effenberger-vollkornbaec… ) and offers a selection of freshly baked and often still warm delicious organic whole-grain bread. You can observe the whole process and have a chat with the baker in charge. A fun place, also for children."
3,"Elegant Italian fine dining restaurant along the Hamburg riverfront. Parking is a short walk away. Delicious food plated gorgeously. Good white wine. Attentive, efficient service! Bravo!My whitefish was 2 generous filets with crispy skin. The accompanying vegetables and mashed potatoes were also yummy. My friend has a large portion of steak which he enjoyed tremendously."
3,"Nice little, or actually rather big, corner café in this not too busy part of the city. I guess by nice little I mean relaxing, which Vesper is on the inside, but I wouldn't sit outside, not during rush hour at least. The owner and her staff are very attentive, interior design is ordinary yet charming somehow. The great thing about this place is its two modes, come evening it gets more restaurant-like. Coffee is good and the selection of draught beer is ample for a café."
4,"Batman hat den besten Dürüm der Stadt. Ich war schon in vielen Dönerläden, aber nirgends ist das Dürümbrot so gut gemacht wie dort. Für jeden weiter zu empfehlen. Der Preis von 3EUR ist auch an der unteren Grenze der Durchschnittsdönerpreise. Außerdem macht der Dürüm dort so richtig satt, also für Hungrige und Genussleute gleichermaßen eine Top- Adresse!"
3,"We went there for the coffee and were pleasantly surprised by the food.  The toasted bagel the hubs ordered with lox & all the trimmings was so very tasty.  A little dab of sweet mustard was the secret ingredient.  -feeling a bit under the weather I ordered a small (4dl?) carrot juice with ginger.  It was just how I would have made it for myself.  The ginger boost was such that I felt I'd never catch a cold again!  Both the bagel and juice were served by a smiling young woman who works in the kitchen.The light roasted beans a la a roastery in Sweden (naturally!) make for a slightly-sour-never-bitter cup and I, for one, am quite glad about that.  The flat white is made with a lactose-rich milk that produces a lovely sweet flavour when heated correctly.  The espresso macchiato (aka noisette in Parisian third wave joints) is made with a 'usual milk' and the drink is tinged with a sour note.We then ordered an Aeropress and were presented with *thee* most choice one could ever hope for!  I think the selection was upwards of twelve different roasts!  Qual der Wahl, baby.  Some of the roasts were meant to ape various black tea varieties.  Eric chose an African bean, Kamigeri, and was quite pleased with both the aroma and flavour.  -a hint of black tea, orange and currant.The young man behind the counter was very enthusiastic, friendly and didn't assume that one didn't know a fig about coffee.  -could be due in part to his having only been on the job for approximately two weeks on our visit.  This made for a friendly exchange when ordering.Winterhude, the area in which SEC is located, is also in and of itself worth a visit.  For those out-of-towners keen to visit H.H., I would strongly encourage not only a trip out of the usual destinations like Reeperbahn & the Harbor, but a trip specifically up to Winterhude with a stop or more in Eimsbüttel as well."
3,"I brought a group of 9 on a Saturday with a last minute reservation for 8, which normally doesn't work because they're usually full. So I was worried, but it was surprisingly quiet that evening and we got a very nice room to ourselves with room for many more than our single tag-along guest. We were fortunate.But such popularity comes at a cost. I don't remember the prices being so high and the portion sizes so small for dishes which are relatively simple to prepare. €3.50 for a side of Bratkartoffeln. It couldn't have been more than 1 potato. (See photo)The service was excellent, as I expected it would be. Very observant waiters with a sense of humor. Although if you have a problem with your food (my friend didn't like the Pulled Pork Burger -- not enough BBQ flavor, which I agree with) they will look at you surprised and defend it and discuss it and deny it until finally they offer something to compensate. But that's typical of every Hamburg restaurant I've been to in the last 6 years. Even the foreign restaurants adopt this local attitude that nothing can ever be wrong with their food.But I have to reduce my review to 4 stars because, while the food is generally good and the service great (by German standards), they appear to be positioning themselves as something exclusive and gourmet by serving more porcelain than food and then charging an arm and a leg for it -- which would only be justifiable if the dishes were delicacies."
3,"Pretty decent little St. Pauli pub in Eimsbuttel. It gets packed when there's a game on. For the nice summer days they have a large number of benches and tables outside, allowing Urknall to double as a bier garden"
3,"Food = awesome and that is my main motivation to come here. Service is hit or miss and when outside seating isn't possible, the berlin-hipster interior style isn't so much my thing. But if you're coming for the food, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a super hungry boy. You might need a starter then too, so I hear). Enjoy!"
4,"Yelp didn't let us down on our trip to Hamburg, I had read about this place before and was looking forward to trying and I wasn't disappointed! All the tables come with individual tablets to pop up in the middle of table which makes ordering easy especially when your German is less than wunderbar! You select your burger/pulled meat and the type of bun you want and a side. I opted for pulled pork in a sesame bun with amazing thin sliced potatoes. It was delicious! The food was fresh, fast and used good ingredients. The staff were great and this place kicked off a great trip."
4,Ticks all the right boxes. Decent range of Asian dishes at affordable prices. Big portions and always excellent customer service. I'm a regular and a big fan.
4,"Loved this place! Shabby chic all the way! What a cool concept, so comfy it's like sitting on your sofa at home but with the added benefit of table service! The baileys coffee was luuuuuuvly."
1,"We tried seven different dim sum dishes but not only half of it was tasty and authentic. Some fried dumplings smelt already of (pork) fat when being served and didn't taste good either. Since we are regular in Hong Kong and Singapore, we know how it should taste. In addition, we were not amazed about the service either (actually fairly unfriendly, that's why I deduced another star).Nevertheless, we are 10.000km away from Hong Kong and authentic Chinese food is difficult to get: try the chicken feed at the Dim Sum house  they are really good and tasty!"
3,"Nice local Greek place with decent food and big serving sizes. The staff is very attentive and nice, although very loud in conversations. It's pretty dark inside, but there are also some tables outdoor. The menu is quite diverse and most of the food options are meat. Not five stars yet, but definitely recommendable."
3,I had a very good dinner but because I arrived alone on Valentine's Day without a reservation I had to sit at the bar which I don't recommend unless you are very tall. It was uncomfortable with legs dangling for so long otherwise dinner of rib eye with shallot potatoes and spinach was excellent and they pour a fair sized glass of wine.
4,"Leaning house of awesomeness! This is one of those hidden-away pearls of Hamburg. Sadly, now that Hafen City has been planted, this may become a bit less hidden in the near future. The food, in a word, is KILLER. Try the Hamburg Hamburger... sample the potato salad, or venture into the unknown with the Hamburg Weißwürstchen, either way you will not be leaving hungry or poor. The service is friendly, but very Hamburg... so if you are an ass, they will treat you accordingly. The location is small and very much heeled over like a ship at sea, frozen at a 15º -- while some people find this to be charming... others, as I recently learned, simply can not eat in such an environment. The music is pure Bert Kaempfert classics from 1950 - 1970. If you don't know who Bert Kaempfert is, shame on you! Now go Google him. In summary, if you are in this area and are looking for a place to eat. This is the place. If you want to grab a bite before heading off to the Elbphilharmonie... well, you have time... but this is a good place to spend it."
4,High ball drinks bring back the good old times!!
3,Price is a little steep at 9 euro but it does provide for a couple hours of an iinteresting audio guided tour of Hamburg history in your language.  Start on the middle floor and turn left after going up the first flight of stairs.   This will start you at the beginning of Hamburg and will then take you around up until around 1900.  The 20th century is on the lower floor and the period of world war 2 is somewhat hidden below that.  (That area in particular needs narration and better information on Hamburg's history during that time).
3,"I have been here more times then I can remember but recently came to partake in a going away celebration for a co-worker. The food is typical Southern German style and the portions are huge. There is only one thing that is larger than their schnitzel and that is there beer! After all, that is why you go to Hofbräuhaus. It is a huge location with plenty of seats, folk music, and good times. However, if you plan on going you should call ahead and make a reservation. While there you will not only enjoy the beer and food you will be immersed in the Bavarian German culture. Women in their checkered dresses, men in their Lederhosen, and big, burly men chugging pints of beer. You will not be let down!"
1,"I have been at Casa Rita for lunch with some colleagues.First of all, I'm not sure why somebody would define this bistro as ""Italian"". Yes they do have a selection of different type of pasta dishes but I would find it difficult to define any of them Italian.They have a wide selection of food to make a personalised antipasto, but I cannot judge it since I haven't tried it.The bread looked good and tasted great; I cannot say the same for the pasta (we ordered three types) which was generally overcooked and tasteless.Since I wouldn't visit it again I will give it 2 stars."
2,"I like RehBar, the grown up more austere big brother of Aurel. Decent prices and it has a nice ambience but the place is a bit soulless. I like working there as there is free WiFi. Nice but nothing special."
4,"From the moment we wandered into the back room where the stage was all set up like an old-fashioned living room complete with standard lamp and occassional table, I fell in love with Pony Bar. Friendly staff provided us with vegan-friendly sandwiches and delicious cocktails and coffees and we felt very much at home during our gig there. The venue is a little gem."
4,"This is the best place Hamburg has to offer.Come here as long as it's not raining too much; enjoy the river, the view, the ships, your beers. Relax about speedy service, this is not why you are here, just be glad you have a chair.And if it's too crowded, just get your basics from the counter and sit on the rocks or the sand.Don't expect any delicacies - some beers or Weinschorle, some fish rolls or so ... all not bad but certainly not great ... and some serious shipping on view. Kids playing in the sand between the tables.This is Hamburg."
3,"The Turmbar looks quite harmless from the outside, but from the inside, a spiral staircase (minus the stairs!) will take you in circles what seems to be forever until you arrive at the bar at the top. The Turmbar is actually divided into two bars - a small one at the bottom and a larger at the top. I hadn't actually been to the top bar but spent an entire evening in the odd Inca-themed bar at the bottom, which reminded me of a bar I had visited in Disneyworld. Don't worry - even if you decide to party at the bar on the bottom floor, you'll end up having to go on up the spiral, since that's where the toilets are. Recommended for the adventurous and those who are looking for a light evening - you're probably NOT going to want to go up that spiral while plastered."
0,"My husband and I tried Chicago Meatpackers a couple of times and I've been sorely disappointed. The first time they ran out of hamburger buns. Hamburgers are their specialty so it goes without saying it was a disappointment. The second time, we ordered burgers and I didn't think the meat tasted very fresh. In fact, it had a strange and unappealing taste. I won't be going back."
4,"An overwhelming experience in taste.  Every dish was equally delicious - antipasti dish, pasta Bolognese, and Hake with quinoa."
3,"One of my favorite gluten free Italian restaurant in Hamburg! Oh yes, they can make real gluten free food and of course, normal gluten meals. All of them r quite tasty, especially meat dishes and pastas. Absolutely great service, but sometimes because of too many customs eating there. U might need to wait for a while. Love their decoration style and music!"
4,Fisch & co. serve up tasty fresh fish with multiple choices. You can eat inside or outside. It has a really rustic feel and is on the oldest street in Hamburg. The staff is friendly and prices are good.
4,"Oh my gosh, I love this place so much.My husband and I are huge ramen fans, and this place never disappoints. We've been to several ramen restaurants in Düsseldorf, and Zipang may even be an inch above those. We usually get gyoza to start, which is perfectly cooked with a flavorful filling. The miso ramen is my go-to choice, and it's always perfect the way it is. I love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the broth is so tasty. Mochi is a must for dessert. They sometimes switch up the flavors which is nice. I've had chocolate, vanilla, green tea, and black sesame. It can definitely get crowded in here, but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a seat. The outdoor seating is nice in the summer, and I like the Japanese style of the indoor seating. Definitely looking forward to exploring the menu more and coming again and again!"
4,"One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Coffee was well brewed and their flat white really nice (comes with two tiny biscuits). Their French breakfast is really generous, with nice fresh bread, 7 delicious French cheeses with fig mustard and some red berry marmelade, and a truly airy and spectacular butter croissant. And their special out of menu Eggs Benedict were absolutely perfect. Really fresh, free range eggs, beautifully poached with yellow yolks and super crunchy bacon. Swoon. Already made a reservation for next week, as I am hosting guests!"
4,"Great Food, but, BEST Pizza!! - If you don't like to wait (even with reservation) and don't want to hang close with locals (it is somewhat tight in there), this is not the place for you. But if you worship Pizza...man this is it and great atmosphere the later it gets. If you ask for Sambuca, they'll give you a whole bottle and trust you with it and you'll get into party mood with the patrons."
4,Perfekt und sehr lecker!
3,"Fresh fish, fast service, nice waiters, card or cash for pay. I didn't like Tom Yam, but rolls are tasty and look good."
3,Great crepes! We went for one savoury and one sweet and neither my friend or I were disappointed. We sat outside on the river terrace too which was lovely as it was so hot. A great spot in Hamburg!
3,"I thought this was a great choice for typical northern German dishes.  The dishes we ordered were well prepared, with good quality ingredients (especially the fish).  We tried  labskaus - it may be described in your guidebook as a kind of steak tartare, but this version seemed to be cooked with a bunch of interesting spices, then minced and/or pulverized into almost a paste.  Then it was topped with fried egg and served with beets and pickles.  Definitely uniquely Northern German (you won't find that in a Munich beer hall).   The other starter we ordered was a pea soup -- which was fantastically full of bacon.  For mains we had a flat-fish (like a flounder but I didn't catch the name), served smothered in small local shrimps, and a creamy fish stew, very nicely seasoned and served with potatoes that were absolutely perfectly cooked.  Service was very gracious too."
4,My first time back in Germany in over 20 years and my first meal didn't disappoint! Great portions and great quality. The dining room had a very fun and laid back atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it here!
4,This place never fails to deliver amazing authentic Indian food. Great samosas. The dip that comes with the samosas are delicious. Their food has just the right amount of spice. Good portions with very reasonable prices.
3,"Top meat, a bit cold (big doors that don't isolete) and friendly service.Not seat next to the door downstairs if you don't want to freeze!"
4,"For the buffet: Fried chicken is super, also the black pepper beef is really tasty. Sushi is OK-ish. Always so crouded at noon, because it sits inside a company campus. Service is really fast. The restaurant is bright and big, but a little bit loud."
1,"This bar is prety hit and miss and there was a line to get in last night which seemed a bit silly as it""s OK but not all that. I've had some great nights here when the weather was warmer first arriving in Hamburg and I've had some lame nights here too. Over-crowded full of American guys trying to hit on my friends and annoying us, the music being pure cheese at best. Plus side the bartenders are friendly and I've got free shots and drinks here before."
4,"Visit this place for authentic Cantonese Dim Sum, probably the best in town. This manifests itself with 90% of the dining guests being Chinese.The portions have European dimensions, the prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."
3,"Had steak menus here, twice, yummy! Nice service and a great atmosphere!"
3,"This was one of the nicest, most relaxed, dark and dingy bars I found in Hamburg, I was in the city for a week on my own and was comfortable to read my book in here and have a couple of beers or white wines without feeling conspicious. The staff were friendly, the DJ was relaxed and varied, there's even thai snacks brought round to your table. One of the least pretentious bars in the area."
4,"We went last night to Bok as I was in the mood for some asian food. I hadn't been here in years and took a look at the ratings. Was a bit worried as the Bok restaurants have been getting ""destroyed"" in the ratings because of service. WELL, they're listening. I was shocked at how nice our waiter was. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy. He asked every time he walked by whether everything was OK and whether we needed anything else. Almost American style (which pisses me off in the US but is nice to see in Germany). The food is great as everyone else writes. The menu is extensive and you'll find everything to fullfill you Asian eating wishes. The places tend to be full on Friday and Saturdays so consider reserving a table. I also can't wait until HH restaurants become all non-smoking. The place was not well ventilated and the people smoking around us kinda killed the experience and flavors of the food. This is soon remedied. In short, the service (at least at this outpost of Bok) took the bad criticism and made an effort to make us happy. Hopefully we didn't just get a good waiter and the rest suck. It will really be disappointing if I go back and service pisses me off. Then I'll never return as everyone else will simply have been right. UPDATE: We were there last night and service was horrible. We received half of our order wrong and the waitress serving us was less than interested in being good at her job. Further, both tables next to us also had mixed up orders. Finally, to top it all off, the folks behind us ordered something which was grilled at their table. Without my knowing it, my back was covered with oil which was splattering all over the place. My shirt was pretty much ruined and luckily I had my leather coat on a chair on the other side of the table. The management didn't care much about offering a solution for this problem except in hindsight saying I should switch seats....note this is after the back of my shirt was splattered with cooking oil. Finally, the food was less than stellar. The sushi was cut super thing (which was not the case the last time we were there). Additonally, I ordered a grilled beef dish which really didn't taste like much. Oh well, I wanted to like Bok but I won't be returning."
4,"The couple who run this place are great. Vampirish, fixed smiles and waxy skin and absolutely perfect to run a gorgeous, gothy bar. Incredible range of absinthe and other drinks. Don't come here when you're in a rush, each drink is lovingly made, which takes a while. But totally worth it, absolutely divine. When I next visit Hamburg with a friend of mine, I'll make sure we go here. I'm making this place a favourite cos they made sure none of my drinks tasted aniseedy!"
2,"Came here over the weekend as we wanted to check out the Dom but we arrived too early so we walked about 10 min over to Jim Burrito to get some lunch. The place is a bit small and it was packed. There was no line to order so we figured we can just order to go. Luckily as we were ordering a table opened up.I don't think this place takes reservations so you should arrive early to get a good table.We just ordered the burritos, one chorizo and one beef. We were tempted to order the chips and guac but as I saw other tables ordering, I didn't like the chips to guac ratio. Looks like a lot of nacho cheese tortilla chips and a small bit of guac. Also the burritos looked huge and I knew we would fill up on chips and guac and wouldn't be able to finish our burritos later.The wait was a bit long for our burritos. Looks like there is only one chef handling all the orders. There is a sign on a chalkboard letting customers know that the wait can be long so at least they acknowledged this. The burritos arrived after about 15 to 20 min. They are not served in tinfoil and looks like they are grilled on a panini press and then finished in the oven. I am from San Francisco so I expect all my burritos to be in tinfoil unless its a wet burrito so I was weary when I saw the grill marks, the wax paper and the knife and fork. I cut into the chorizo burrito and it looked reasonable - lots of black beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, onions and chorizo. The flavors were good but different then my normal burrito experiences back in the Bay. We dosed the burritos in tapatio and habanero green sauce and that helped kick up the heat and flavors. The chorizo bits were a bit awkward they were a bit chewy and didn't mesh well with the other flavors going on in the burrito.All in all its an OK burrito spot. But as my friend has said, its not exactly the same but it'll scratch that burrito itch when you need it."
1,"Unimpressive and a bit worse than the other locations. Had lunch here today and wasn't impressed whatsoever with the self-service conecept, the tight seating, the slowness of the service and the bland food. Worst was the food. Flavor-less dishes prepared in foo-chain style. I am getting kind of fed up with these concepts which initially work, and then are copied around town ad-infinitum. I wish the main focus remained on quality, but instead they tried to multiply this for profit. Oh well, better luck next time!"
3,"Great place for American breakfast: pancakes with maple syrup, eggs&bacon, coffee. Very casual and cool atmosphere. Americana-mania reached Hamburg! A bit too loud and not cheap. Definitely worth going once in a while, but not the healthiest choice for regular consumption."
3,"Met a good friend here for a coffee. It was Sunday and packed and rightly so! The coffee was very good and the atmosphere was very nice, not quite what I expected from the area. I did not try any of their food offerings, but the nice man next to me seemed to truly enjoy his chocolate cake. I also noticed that they had a Brunch Bar out, and that families were helping themselves to the emptying selection (it was after 13:00). Looking forward to my next time back! Check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"Our first choice of restaurant was fully booked (we'd forgotten to reserve a table), and the host there recommended this place near by.    we had a decent pizza (quite spicy) and a pasta.  The pasta seemed slightly undercooked (not quite al-dente yet).  This would normally cause me to rate them at 3 stars, but they had a nice wine (Brunello di Montalcino) for a decent price, which bumps them back up to 3 1/2, so I will be generous and give four."
3,"Unglaublich groß. Man sollte mit viel Zeit hingehen, um die ganzen kleinen Details wirklich erkennen zu können. Leider war es extrem voll als ich dort war. Eine Wartezeit von über einer Stunden ist wohl auch normal. Aber für Fans ein MUSS!"
4,"Given the price and the fact that literally nothing on the menu exceeds 7 EUR, it's an awesome place to have lunch. It offers not only must-have Turkish options but also some less common dishes. Everything is super yummy and the service is prompt.  The downside is that the line is usually long and they are open only Mon-Fri around lunchtime."
2,"As usual took half an hour to queue to get in here, then we were sat in the window so the queue could get then watch us eat our meal. The food is OK, the service friendly and I get the local loyalty from a Hamburg chain-done-good but each time I visit Block House I vow never again. There are a lot of much better places to eat in Hamburg."
3,"Authentic Korean food. The service is just okay due to their overcrowded client volume. The food is nice. I'll recommend roast meat menu and their ""hot pot"" menu (it's actually kind of bigger version of soup). I have to say it is a bit pricy compared to the quality of food."
3,"We stopped by here on a whim - the prospect of a margarita while sitting outside in the warm weather was too good to pass up.And the margaritas, and service, did not disappoint. I'll preface by saying we love margs, but only the good ones, not the sweet syrupy ones. These were incredible, handmade (took a little while) and delicious. We were also told they were bringing us Nachos which was a nice gesture but we anticipated a microwaved mess. Instead, we got a plate that was more like hot, homemade tomato / bean dip with a few tortilla chips layered in. Combined With the spicy homemade chili sauce, it was delicious. Service was great too, excited to go back for a full meal!"
3,"Really like this place - nice coffee, alternative folks, loungy music.Need a location to celebrate? You can even rent the Bacana for private parties, the owner is definitely a laid back dude. Just be sure you organize a few things yourself, if you need a DJ or anything ;)The Bacana is nice for breakfast and coffee during day, but also a cosy location to hang out later. Contra (to me): sometimes the guys smoke, which you can smell the next day while wanting to have breakfast"
2,This is an OK bar which tends towards stylish. Fairly dark and modern atmosphere. Still fills up at times with a pretty local crowd. Prices are OK. Bartending is average. You can sit outside in the summer and people watch pretty well. Only problem I have with this place is that at times at draws exactly the crowd you would try to avoid in Ottensen. Not typical though and always a good default place for a couple of drinks. I used to really like the Hollywood Canteen which used to be at this location prior to Reh Bar opening up. Unfortunately that place went downhill after moving. I guess then Reh Bar is a better alternative.
4,This place is Amazing!! The servers are very attentive and very nice and the food is great! All the food is very fresh and it doesn't break your wallet and the portions are huge.
3,"a classic hangout in Hamburg's Sternschanzeit's a beautifully restored ground floor  salon furnished with vintage sofas. Some of them are so old that you might feel the springs but that's part of the atmosphere I guess.It's a good place to meet people or just watch people because on Friday and Saturday nights the place is buzzing and you will most likely share your soda space with others - so conversation is eased. The drinks are helpful as ice-breakers, of course.During the day it is cafe, especially nice when it opens its front windows in the summer so it has a whole open front wall.Their bathrooms are a shame though.... but that seems to be a general problem in Hamburg..."
3,"Pretty cool concept. Bunch of couches laying around (well, aligned perfectly, actually - It's Germany after all), a few vintage lamps lighting the place and a small bar at the end. Sat down late at night, had a few ciders and a nice convo. This one's called Zöe #2 because the lounge across the street called Zöe #1 and belongs to the same people. They look the same but we chose this one because #2 didn't serve tea (true story). Anyway, chill place to chill, A+"
3,"I was walking around hungry in this fantastic neighborhood when this random German girl came up to me and suggested this place. And she wasn't kidding, the food here is top notch. Low key (meaning not fancy) decor, typical menu for this kind of cuisine but the quality is fantastic. I had the falafel with halloumi and it was fried on-the-spot...amazing. The counter is small and crowded, but service is brisk and you get your food fast even when there is a lineup (there is always one here apparently, which is a great sign). The crowd here is very mixed which makes it interesting. And it cheap, cheap, CHEAP (my dish plus bottled water around €5). Recommended!"
4,Excellent gyros and other Greek specialities from very friendly people who know their food. Also a great take-away selection.
4,Was very impressed with this stylish and cool restaurant which used to be an old warehouse. It is very different to any restaurant I've been to. The food was also very tasty and the staff were very pleasant.
3,"I was here at lunch/breakfast time. The place is in itself very nice and has a cool atmosphare. The food was also good but some details were missing to be perfect. The choice of breakfast is a bit reduced for my tastes, but all the dishes were prepared with care. Unfortunately the egg was cold :( they have a much better offer of luch dishes, like pasta, sandwiches and soups. The say that all the ingredients are bio and home made. The service is nice but a little slowof course that could mean that they really prepare evey dish live and not microwave. At last i would like to point out the cool juices and the always available water!"
3,"Preparation takes a while but it's worth to wait. It's  a jumbo tortilla, expect nothing less, make sure you are really, really hungry before you go in :)"
3,The BallinStadt Auswanderermuseum is located close to Veddel S-Bahn Station at the old location where the emigrants stayed before the left for their new lives. The museum explains the lives of the emigrants in Hamburg and shows where they emigrated to. It is also possible to search for ancestors but I was a bit disappointed that there was not a good explanation how to search.
4,"A must visit in HamburgTip: book your ticket online in advance to save moneyWe booked our tickets online in advance. Online, it charges 1 euro for the processing fee, however, you save a certain percentage (5% - 50%) for some early and late time slots.The Airbnb host told us to book in advance because the lineup may get very long.We came on a Wednesday night around 7 pm, there was hardly anyone lineup. The staff let us came early even though we booked tickets for a later time slot. I think we spent 3 hours at this place. It has too much to see.This place is definitely the highlight of Hamburg. I think Hamburg does not have too much tourist things to do, so this is the best tourist activity we did in Hamburg."
4,"Very cute crepery with authentic, delicious crepes. Lovely place to sit and relax. Great artwork and decor on the walls, with paintings by French artists.  Staff/cook are all French. I got the buckwheat salmon and legumes savory crepe, and ""the delicious"" as the sweet crepe. Both were fantastic but I loved the sweet one more. The toasted almonds were a splendid touch.  Highly recommend this place!"
3,"We went to Brodersen after a hard but successful day of work in search of a decent reward. All I can say we found it in some delicious German classics that probably did not extend our life expectancy, but felt truly rewarding. I had the ""fischer frühstück""  (omelette with some type of north see shrimp named ""Krabben"") and my friend the pork filets in cream sauce. I always felt that speck is the perfect matrix for pan fried potatoes, and here this was confirmed. All was very delicious. We finished up with two large plates of ""rote grütze"" (jello made with real berries) which was also state of the art...slightly sour and not too sweet containing big fruit chunks. Very nice! I can only recommend this place!"
2,Do you want to experience bavaria in north germany? Come here then! It has litter beers and german food. I went on a friday night and it as really loud with live music. The staff is dressed up with bavarian attire so its a nice touristy attraction. The staff wasnt too friendly but they did give us english menus to help us out. Good place for beers.
4,wie immer sehr fleischig!
2,Good service. This place is well located and not over prices despite being across road from train station. Wasn't crazy for the pilsner beer I had but good selection. Food looks good from what I saw on other tables. Not a bad stop off but you feel like moving on from here eventually...
3,"The burritos are wonderfully juicy, which makes them hopeless to eat, but you won't care. You'll be on the most wonderful journey exploring that burrito, one bite at a time, going deeper and deeper into a food-haze. Next stop: sweat pants city. I had the pulled-beef (soup?) with... um, everything.I do have some (minor) criticism:Burritos are made in front of your eyes, yet once they're done they are taken away for heating -- forever. Why? It's not even that hot once you get it.I'm also not a fan of the ambiance. I get it; ""it's a fast food place, it should look like it"". I'm not sure what it is, I think it might be the florescent lights in one end combined with the dark-ish-ness in the other; it makes my brain confused. I want the same warm fuzzy feeling that burrito gives to be confirmed by my eyes.Not that I'll be looking or even be aware once I'm halfway done. But still.This is the closest to ""Californian cooking"" I've experienced since my half year living there; a time where eating was one big blur, and I can't remember any particular burrito. But I do remember the feeling. It's the feeling of Qrito."
3,"Bok have built up quite a chain of restaurants around Hamburg. In Altona there are two and in Schanze I think they have 6(!). Obviously this means they're doing something right. The food is mostly Thai, but I think most of their places serve a variety of asian dishes. For instance there is normally some Sushi on the menu. This particular Bok is a self-service one - meaning that you queue at a counter, place and order and then wait for your number to come up. Personally I much prefer this to their restaurant experience. It's a bit cheaper, much faster, but just as good food. Hmm, I really should comment on the food. It's good without being great, if I'm honest. One of those places that you're always happy to eat at, but perhaps you're not going to go out of your way to go to."
0,"This place is a nightmare! Went with a group of six and from start to finish, everything was inexcusable. The seating was tight, the service was rude and unattentive, the place is loud in a bad way, and the food is blah. People overrate the meat here by so much. It's OK, but folks, I could do much better with my own barbecue at home. I've had much better Rodizio in much cheaper restaurants elsewhere. Drinks came wrong, stuff that was mixed such as an Alsterwasser was watered down, and requests for condiments were simply ignored. When paying, everything took way too long (technical issues suppossedly) and no one seemed to care. Service is the absolute biggest disaster at this place. I've never actually had a waiter argue with me to the extent that these clowns were willing to go. When we started, we didn't want salad. We simply wanted to get right to the meat. This wasn't allowed as I guess we were suppossed to fill ourselves with starters to eat less meat. It was also clear that they avoided coming around too often with the meat skewers so as to hold back consumption. This place is a total joke and should be avoided."
2,"We found Al Volo on Yelp a few months back, while we were looking at an apartment nearby. It was cold outside, we were tired and hungry, and Al Volo's clean, warm, and well-lighted interior was extremely welcoming.On my first trip, I ordered the pizza affumicata (smoked ham and smoked mozzarella), which was really excellent. My wife is partial to the pizza piemonte (with black truffle cheese), and my daughter loves their kids' pizzas. The pizzas are tasty and come out of the kitchen quickly.On our second trip, I made the mistake of venturing beyond the pizza menu, which turned out to be a mistake. I love me some spaghetti carbonara, so I gave it a try. It was heavy, with overcooked noodles and a too-heavy sauce that stiffened after a few minutes. There was ample pancetta, but that couldn't help the situation.The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The dining room is casual and comfortable. Just stick to the pizza and you'll be fine."
4,"Nostalgia is my favourite Greek restaurant in Hamburg as all the appetizers, hot & cold starters and fish meals are served fresh and tasty, the staff is very friendly like most of Greeks and the price is fair for this pleasure.You can simply go for mixed starter plates, baby sardines, a greek salad and gilt head bream ""dorado"" and of course with a company of ouzo plomari."
4,"Just finish classes at Colon Language School? Go to this small basement restaurant called ""Delikatessen des Meeres"" two buildings away. There's no menu. The chef cooks one dish per day and varies daily, depending on what's freshly supplied on the day. Sometimes shrimps with potatoes, sometimes salmon spaghetti with mustard sauce to die for. EUR 5,50 each. Portion is humungous. You'll drop your jaw to pay so little for such quality food. Fresh!! Waiting time is long, between 20-40 mins during lunch. You will be told the number of bell ring to collect your plate. Sitting is limited to indoor area, can get quite narrow during winter. Great ambient to eat with Opera and Classical music. Food cooked with love. Best time to go: Summer before or after lunch-time (waiting time 5-10 mins)! There's many sitting area outdoor. My perfect place to chill out under sunshine in Summer!!! Best goes with a glass of wine for EUR 3,50... hmm, maybe two..."
3,"Really good dim sum. Some of the best I've had in Hamburg. In truth I regret not getting more of the main dishes here. I had a few with aubergines that were actually really good and would have liked to order more.But what can I say about the dim sum here? Chicken feet, rice rolls and dumplings oh my! Well worth a 20-min U-bahn to get here and enjoy this places specialties."
4,"It's a wonderful, quaint little restaurant.  The staff was friendly and helpful with understanding the menu.  My German is nonexistent.  The entrees change weekly and the dish I ordered was full of flavor.  The appetizers were authentic and tasty.  Overall it is a nice place."
4,"RIB Happy Hour is awesome. 990 Euro for high-quality food. Forward: I walked by Jolie a few weeks ago and noticed two large guys rubbing their bellies after finishing off what looked like an entire pig. Both had plates stacked with bones in front of them. I asked a woman sitting outside(who turned out to be the owner) about the deal and she confirmed Happy Hour for Ribs on Wednesday, 990euro. Service: I returned for dinner last night. The owner was seated outside and seemed bothered that I was only there to eat food, not drink alcohol.  I was the only person in the restaurant so I would think my business would be appreciated. After a somewhat heated discussion about why I should order drinks whenever I go to any German restaurant, Claudia apologized and her smile came out, which was lovely. The waiter was young and jovial. Food: Dinner was great. Close to an entire rack of spicy-honey ribs, a small salad with sprouts, crispy potato wedges with sour cream and chives, and two pieces of perfectly grilled garlic bread. I don't even like garlic bread and I devoured the entire meal. A lot of food, a lot of great food for 990Euro. The ribs were overcooked in the slightest but not enough to warrant losing a star. The food was so delicious that it knocked the bad taste out of my mouth from earlier. I'll definitely be back with my girlfriend next week, and we will drink, and hopefully the experience will be even better."
2,"It was Saturday and both having full blow hangovers and in need of some serious carbs, meat, grease and salt to soak up some of that seedy feeling we set out to find Jim block.My friend being from the US and eager to have a good burger something which he had not had since being in Hamburg. After 3 hours of trying to find it and a parking space in the very crowded centre of Hamburg we finally made it to our destination.I must admit I expected a little more from the burgers... huge in size yes and the service was quick and the place has a nice feel to it but other then that I can't say that the burgers were all that great. I personally feel the one I had at Hollywood canteen was much better... Still there are more burgers to try on the menu and maybe it was just the one I ordered and it definitely beats MacDonald's and even Hesburger which you all know I'm rather fond of after a night out."
3,"Fun spot! Great views of the Hamburg Hafen and City. For the location and dress code the prices are reasonable. We had a lovely waitress and the drinks were perfectly mixed. A table may be hard to come by as this spot becomes more and more popular, so even on a Monday night it may be best to call ahead."
4,"This is one of the greatest accomplishments in the existence of human creation. If you're going to be in Hamburg, there are only 2 things you must do:1) Get a delicious hamburger2) Go to Miniatur WunderlandYou will be 1000% amazed with your senses overloaded. I think the best model is the airport. I could sit there for an hour just watching it operate. Do not miss watching the Millennium Falcon take off.One activity I wish I did was the challenge where you find certain objects/people and solve a puzzle. I was just too amazed when I walked in that I didn't even know the welcome brochure had the puzzle in it. I will definitely be back here in the future and will undergo said challenge.You can spend forever here so plan accordingly. While my daughter loved it a lot, she got tired after a while of awing at the miniature greatness in front of us.Just wow!"
3,"Very nice little Pizza place in Talstraße, just a few steps away Dron the Reeperbahn. It's definitely not easy to eat inside because of its size (during summer there are some more seats outside though) but pizza is good and quite cheap. Give it a try of you are in the Reeperbahn area and you are hungry!"
0,"Frechheit! I ordered a Deli Burger from the lunchtime menu and wow, what an absolutely disappointing, overpriced lunch!At €11.50, I was stupid enough to assume that something above average would arrive at our table - how wrong could I be??The burger arrived and only filled a quarter of the plate. Not even the tiniest garnish was served with this 'meal'. The burger itself was nothing special at all and so covered in coleslaw, it was very hard to decide if the burger was handmade, bought or frozen.I expected way more from a restaurant owned by a famous German chef. Go to McDonald's just up the street if you want something bigger and better value for money. What an absolute rip off!!!"
1,"Wow, surprised at all the positive reviews here. Some people either have really low standards, or many of these are faked. This place was quite a disappointment. Outside of the decent sized portion of Aioli and bread to kick of the meal, everything else went downhill. I'm almost inclined to give only one star but I've had worse (directly in the area where this restaurant is!) I actually feel that most of the restaurants in the area are horrible and hence the general quality of all is drawn downwards. This place may have had it's prime but is long past it now. Our waiter didn't quite understand the concept of service. The food itself was absolutely mediocre and a day later, I have some serious indigestion from the lamb with garlic dish. Food was thrown on to the table basically when being served to us. The waiter couldn't be bothered to come to our table regularly to check on things and he really didn't care to be nice. The prices are also much too high for what you get. Finally, where I was sitting outside, right next to their entrance, it stank. There was a nasty odor coming from the ground level vent right there. Gosh I hope this wasn't coming from their kitchen. This place may have been good but no more. I'd seriously consider twice if you plan on eating there."
2,"Die Lage ist super, der Service ziemlich flott, fast zu schnell. Das Früstück ist lecker aber auch etwas teurer. Ich delber hatte einen Grupon Gutschein (11EUR) über ein Frühstück (wert 22EUR), dies war zwar ok, jedoch auch nur die 11EUR wert, keinesfalls 22EUR. Zudem blieb es so nah auf dem Wasser nicht aus das div. keine Insekten herumschwirrten und sich auf dem Obst, der Wurst oder im Kaffee/ O-Saft niedergelassen haben."
4,This restaurant has lots of vegan choices which are delightful and the service is always friendly! It's a restaurant I always love coming back to!
0,"High expectations, with zero outcome. Totally overpriced and tasteless.  The bar was loaded with unwashed glasses. Bartenders didn't wear masks and handled food without gloves, then wiped their hands on their pants. The raviolis with bacon were undercooked and the bacon could barely be cut. After waiting 2 hours for the main dish , The Spätzle was a disaster. Zero flavor and completely watered down. When I mentioned it to the kitchen, I was told they ran out of cheese. As if I wouldn't notice. Definitely would avoid this overpriced and over hyped , poorly managed ""celebrity restaurant."""
3,"Have been here for the first time. I certainly took a while until we got served. And it even took longer until the food was ready... But both, Pizza and Pasta were really great though, do it's worth the time!"
4,"So good! Boyfriend loves burgers and we both had heard good things about this place so we tried it out. We both loved our meals. I'm not a big steak person so I tried the K-Rod crispy chicken sandwich and it was seriously so good. Also good beer options from tap!Service was very friendly, and made an effort to chat with us a little bit here and there. Price is a bit higher but still reasonable as the food here is top notch. Don't forget to make a reservation! You can make it online through their reservation system very easily."
4,"Very busy and popular place with excellent food and service! The staff was friendly and smiling, and the food was flavorful and attractive (my fish was cooked perfectly). The tables are very close and crammed, which is a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, the environment is enjoyable."
3,"Knuth is a lovely and over-popular cafe in central Altona. Be prepared to wait around for at least 10 minutes before getting a table if you show up mid-morning on the weekend for breakfast. The menu is relatively simple. All the standard German breakfast options based around bread, cheese, meat, fruit and eggs are here. Nicely put together with quality ingredients and at a reasonable price. I like Knuth, but it does get a bit full of young parents..."
4,"Friendly, Cosy, Delicious.This place is our second home. The staff is super positive, quick and always welcoming. You have got a million choicesfrom breakfast, potatoes over chicken in peanut sauce, wraps. pancakes to Giros. There is always something you are longing for. The fresh joices and cocktails take you to the lost summer AND the place even has SOYA milk for all us lactose intollerant people. Oh and the Martini comes in a martini glass.AND comes at a very good price. I bet James B. would come here if he ever had another case in HamburgMy only suggestion would be to come up with a weekly special, which is not on the menu and could surprise regulars like us!And of course as always the toilette review: they are clean, but a touch of comfort could be added. Some vintage style accessoires or something.I gotta say, it is my favorite place in the Schanze  don't know what we would do without it."
4,"Best Indian food I've had in Hamburg thus far. Went here on an impulse with coworkers for lunch. Little hole in the wall place with amazing food at incredibly low prices. We shared an appetizer of veggie samosas. Love the way it was plated with a variety of dips at all degrees of heat from none to more than some. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Thali, it contained a moderate hint of heat which was enjoyable. My dish came with chicken, rice, yoghurt, a mini salad, bean/legume side, and naan. It was hard to believe all this was just €5.50. After seeing my coworker's plate of Chili Chicken Thali, I think I will have to try that next time to test just how spicy it might be."
4,Great selection of top quality meat but most impressive is the wine list. This place is serious about wine with the biggest selection of American wine I have seen in Europe. The Sommelier was also really great she recommended a Ridge Zinfandel with a little age. It went great with our Danish dry aged (90days)! They even show all the meat dry aging. This is great for a date night or celebration. Price quality was on point.
4,"I finally made it to Zipang. The 35 minutes waiting outside in the cold were totally worth it. We started out with the gyoza, which unlike other places was not deep fried, hence the real deal. The ramen were absolutely delicious and the eismochi was to die for, specially the mango one!! Service was very friendly and quick. Will be back many times."
4,"I went there for breakfast and ordered a cappuccino and Hummus Bowl (Lime hummus, beetroot hummus, edible wildherb salad, beluga lentils, organic pached egg, sesame, pumpkin seeds, sunflowerseed & sourdough bread). The coffee was great and the food was simple and tasty (it was more tasty than I expected).They have outside tables and an upper floor. There are some tables next to the windows with a view over a canal. Nice interior overall. The waitress was nice too.It was a peaceful slow morning in this nice café. I will be back."
3,"I'd say the food in here isn't as good as in Frank und Frei across the street, but it's got plenty of charm to make up for it. And you just gotta love their breakfast, which comes with a glass of sparkling wine. There was a nice buzz about the place and the staff make you feel welcome. Minus for bad coffee though."
3,"Came on Phil's recommendation, but they didn't seem to be doing a normal breakfast. There seemed to be only two choices: scrambled eggs or muesli. I went for the scrambled eggs with bacon. It was a nice, if unspectacular, breakfast."
