4,"cute little bistrot in eppendorf!very friendly staff and delicious food! It's best for a sunny saturday or an early dinner and/or a glass of wine after work, since Engelke closes at 8pm. We were 3 there, and each of us had a different meal. They all tasted amazingly good and are very fresh.Actually they have a constant menu, a week menu and a daily menu, so you can't get bored from the food there. I dont have any complaints!"
4,The restaurant has more than just Vietnamese food. We had tasty Thai style curry dishes - a welcome break from wurst. Prices are good and the waiter is attentive.
4,"Beautiful cafe in a quiet place in Eimsbuettel,always offering very fresh and delicious food, be it a breakfast or lunch or just coffee&cake. Very customer oriented service, good prices, fine decore in a country style.Tables in a front room (there is another room at the back) are very densly packed, so be warned  your neighbour will hear every detail of your conversation! If it's completely full, most likely during lunch time, expect lots of table and chair shuffling to let customers to get in or out. Have to say it, the place is lovely anyway and worth visiting!"
4,"Hello Friends, welcome welcome welcome! The place looks lovely, the handmade tables are gorgeous and so is the bar. Nice job. It's sparse of course, but you'll grow into that gigantic space soon enough. It takes time...til then: The food is really good. I love that I can have a burger medium instead of charred like back home (it's ground STEAK), I love that the emphasis is on the meat and not the bread. I love that there's a roll of paper towels right on the table for me to wrap myself in so I don't get covered in food. I love that a real someone cut each and every fry on my plate. I love love love the pickles that bossman makes himself. FINALLY DECENT PICKLES! I love a ton of ice in my cola, and big German beer.Even the NY cheesecake is alright ;) I'm so glad you're here! I am just down the street if you ever need anything, cup of sugar, directions etc..."
3,Great food and good service. Food came out quite fast considering how busy it was. Also portions was generous.
4,Such an interesting part of Hamburg... A place where old meets new to the max. Even though it reminds me of Holland and Amsterdam a lot it has it own charm due to the new part Hafencity being add to the old Speicherstadt... Cannot wait for the Elbphilharmonie to be finished and see this area grow to a fun and interesting place. It could use some green and trees though... That is a pity... a leafy lane would work well here as contrast to both the new and the old!!!
4,Delicious! The jumbo portion is too much for one person. The prices are right and the curry sauce they use is amazing. This place has probably the best currywurst I've ever eaten. Beats many places in Berlin out of the water.
4,"Uns hat die 1. Platzierung im Zeit-Newsletter hier her gelockt! Und wir kommen ganz sicher wieder! Steht nicht gerade eine lange Schlange von Eisliebhabern vor der Tür, ist der Laden recht unscheinbar und schnell zu übersehen.Die Wartezeiten sind kurz, und sollte es doch mal etwas länger dauern - es lohnt sich!  Es gibt ca. 12 Eissorten zur Wahl, darunter Klassiker wie Stracciatella, Schoko, Nuss, etc. Eine Kugel kostet 1,10 Euro. Für meinen Geschmack hätten die Sorten etwas ausgefallener sein können, aber dann entdeckte ich das Spaghetti-Eis auf der Karte! Da musste es auch gleich die große Portion für 4,20 Euro sein. Gott, was für eine Eis-Offenbarung! Ich habe noch nie so ein geiles Spaghetti-Eis gegessen. Super sahnig-cremiges Eis mit leckerer Erdbeersauce, weißen Schokostreuseln und eine gute Portion Sahne unter dem Eis!   Eisliebe hat ganz verdient den 1. Platz unter den Top Eisdielen in Hamburg verdient!"
4,Best Döner in Hamburg !
4,"A great value Syrian (I think!) lunch venue in Aldstadt. Don't expect to get served within 20 minutes and get back to work, but if you want a decent sit down session come Friday, you can't go far wrong."
3,This is a very nice family owned Italian restaurant. I came here for dinner and enjoyed the cosy atmosphere. Better yet it was neither too pack nor was it too loud. The food was alright. Not the best Italian I have had in Hamburg but definitely fair in regards to value for money. The mains are ~8 euros. What I can vouch very much for though is their tiramisu. That was very good and very large! Order one and split between 2 as I did.The most surprising thing for me was this was the first time in my entire year in Hamburg thus far  that a waiter has asked me if I'd like tap water when i asked for water. This is such a rarity in Germany. Anyone that's moved to Germany will know what i mean. That in itself is deserving of an additional star hence 4
4,"Since my visit in 2013, I've been telling everyone I know to go here who will be in Hamburg. (I'm a little surprised/ashamed I didn't write a review yet...)This place is incredible. It's several stories of a warehouse that's been converted into an aptly-named miniature wonderland. The attention to detail into every aspect of this space is simply astounding. It perfectly encapsulates what happens when smart, whimsical people set their minds to building amazing, tiny things :)Kids probably love it, too, but knowing my nephew we would probably never make it past the first floor-- it's that big and engrossing. I found the control center the most fascinating part, but others in my group liked the airport-- planes ""took off"", ""landed"", taxied and did it all over again on a schedule that was tracked in real time on a screen. Several places seem pretty darned accurately modeled in terms of what a place actually looks like; others have taken a wee bit of poetic license to make it fit within the warehouse (for example, the USA section represents Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and several other places that look as if they're right next to each other, when that is not exactly how it goes in the US). There's even a model of Hamburg. I won't spoil the wonder of visiting for yourself with any more details about what you'll see-- just plan to spend at least a few hours here to fully appreciate the splendor."
3,"Authentic, yummy Vietnamese cuisine, good quality meat, no use of glutamate. Ambiance could be a little cozier though and it was a little chilly inside."
2,"Well, what can I say? Borcher's is the place you went to in the 80s when you were fed up with all that neon shit.In exchange you got some tavern-like wood furniture, with lame and boring folks.Nothing no changed here since the 80s. Even the music - I mean: SOLID AS A ROCK blaring from the speakers. C'mon, seriously?Hadn't tastes other than their home brewed beer, which is okay."
2,On a nice sunny day its a good place to walk along the Elbe or to sit and watch the ships go by. you can also take a ferry over to Finkenwerder town on the other side of the river.
4,"As an American, I eat Mexican food often! It's rare you leave North America and travel across the Atlantic to find Mexican food as good, maybe better than where you started. Jim Burrito is a great place to have yourself a Burrito or Quesadilla! Everything we tried was authentic and more importantly, DELICIOUS! Go there!"
4,Amazing food better than our visit to italy. The restraunt staff was so wonderful. We loved watching the chef cook our food and our mouths watered with every plate. The chef gave my son and daughter an ice cream and came personally to each table to make sure every person was happy and fully satisfied. Wonderful place they take visa Mastercard and dogs :) and my kids wanted to go again for dinner
4,"If you like fine cocktails, a great variety of Whiskeys and a lot of other good beverages, this is the place for you. This bar has a touch of luxury and class, people do like to dress up when they come here. They also offer snacks, if you'd become hungry after the 3rd to 5th drink :)The staff is working in a pro-manner and is really friendly. I recommend reserving a table at the Bacardi Lounge."
3,"Arguably the most centrally located restaurant in the Hamburg, being situated in the vaulted basement of the City Hall (and just around the corner from Rathousmarkt station).Good selection of food, good service, reasonable prices.  And - always useful for the traveller - English menus if needed.In summer months they also open a Terrace in the City Hall courtyard."
4,"Lovely food! Cosy atmosphere!We wanted vegetarian food, but don't speak German too well...The waitress however spoke excellent english, and gave us some options instead.We ended up with some amazing antipasti, and delicious truffle pasta.I can also highly recommend the Creme Brulee ;)Also looked to be a great fish selection, and would love to come back and try it!"
3,Great food.  The staff was friendly and the food was on point. Decent wifi which was extremely necessary during my vacation. Cocktails were perfect.
3,"been here several times, usually pretty early in the afternoon. it's a small place, & there are only ever 1 or 2 people working at a time. thus the service can be pretty slow; however, i find that the croques are worth it. i always get the antipasti croque, it's amazing, and also big enough that i take half home & get a second meal out of it (your mileage may vary). try dining in the quiet little garden out back if the weather's nice."
3,This place is a lot smaller than expected but the food was so tasty. I recently converted to vegetarianism and needed to find a place that catered to such. I was craving Mexican food and this was the first place that popped up on my search. This is not a fast food place so don't expect to get your order within 5 minutes of ordering. There weren't any free tables so my bf and I sat at the bar sipping on our Fritz-Kolas as we waited ~25min for our food.I ordered the spinach quesadilla with 3 sides of salsa dip. It was so goodddd!!! I think it's enough to hold you over until dinner time.
4,"Over the years I have managed to go to the bird every time i am in hamburg. i have been to hamburg many times. and the bird is a highlight. The fries are fresh potatoes and the burgers re ridiculously good. they are fat, mine are bloody red, juicy, and messy. served on an english muffin which is a nice touch. full bar, awesome staff, and punk rock at heart. i have had the steak once- ribeye- and it was great, but the burgers really are the main attraction. lots of choices in preparation, i go basic cheese with an egg (the dumb texan) but the big rock is great, and my vegetarian pals  say the black bean option is killer. the bird is worth your time."
4,"This is one of the greatest accomplishments in the existence of human creation. If you're going to be in Hamburg, there are only 2 things you must do:1) Get a delicious hamburger2) Go to Miniatur WunderlandYou will be 1000% amazed with your senses overloaded. I think the best model is the airport. I could sit there for an hour just watching it operate. Do not miss watching the Millennium Falcon take off.One activity I wish I did was the challenge where you find certain objects/people and solve a puzzle. I was just too amazed when I walked in that I didn't even know the welcome brochure had the puzzle in it. I will definitely be back here in the future and will undergo said challenge.You can spend forever here so plan accordingly. While my daughter loved it a lot, she got tired after a while of awing at the miniature greatness in front of us.Just wow!"
4,"Carnivore heaven! There's not much to say: If you like meats, go here.Note: it's cash only, get here early for lunch or prepare to wait in line, and don't expect to be productive for at least an hour after having the big plate.Only minus I can think of is that there's limited seating when outdoor is not an option.Oh, and regular visits here probably guarantee a heart attack (it isn't exactly healthy)."
2,Not the best Hard Rock experience ever. Had to wait over an hour to get a table - on a Monday night in April? This was not high tourist season and it was midweek but there seemed to be an issue with service and the speed of the staff. Eventually got a table 90 mins later but the meal was very slow in being served too. Were they caught out and were short staffed? Who knows but it was 4 hours after we arrived that we finally left. Not good enough. Food was usual Hard Rock standard and no complaints about that but the service was not what you would expect.
2,"Was waiting for my bus from Hamburg to Berlin and had some time to kill so I wanted a sit down to eat place instead of a form of takeout, I walked around the haubenhauf and found a string of restaurants and after looking at all the posted menus I decided I'd check out Nagel which is a German pub/restaurant, there is plenty of outdoor seating but I opted to sit inside which had plenty of tables and a good ambiance, they had a few different beers and liquors on the menu but I wasn't actually in the mood to have a drink so I opted for a water, for food I have their house salad which was good and had a dressing already on there, I ordered a schnitzel yet again which came with sliced roasted potatoes almost like potato du jour, the schnitzel I ordered came with horseradish sauce I decided to give it a shot and have a dish I really like prepped a little differently, it wasn't bad but I definitely prefer it with the sweeter sauce, overall this is a decent spot that's close to both hamburg's central station and also close to the bus station as well, I think I'd try another spot before trying this one again, not because it was bad but just because it wasn't too memorable to be honest"
3,"Pretty awesome place, I found it after reading the Yelp reviews as there are 4 falafel places in a row pretty much. Service for starters was welcoming, even though the place was busy in my opinion I was treated with respect and the owners seemed humble. That was a nice feeling to start off with.I ordered a falafel with aubergine, the best was when I saw it being wrapped - it was huge! All for 3,50 Eur, awesome. And delicious - great to know you're not eating meat and it still fills you and tastes great.The joint actually has a smallish upstairs section including toilet, and apparently they have Wifi as well, but I couldn't find the password. The upstairs section was really cosy for a takeaway kind of place, clean as well. I'll definitely come back here and try more things from the menu."
3,"If the lamb is on special and you are an eater of lamb, I implore you to take it. This is the reasoning I used and left highly sated in terms of red meat levels and happiness factor. The service was lovely, especially in regards to keeping wine glasses full, explaining the menu (going the extra kilometer to explain in english the specials), providing quick translations and overall just being very pleasant and excited about the experience. My lamb with veggies in a mint/thyme sauce was elegantly plated and the taste surely matched the looks. A medium portion, just enough to fill up but not be overly full. The cinnamon rice I snagged from across the table was also quite a treat...savory sweet. We had a range of appetizers, the standouts being the falafel and the red beet paste. The dipping sauces for the bread were a bit bland, and the other starters quite small (more like tapas, but smaller) so a bit hard to split amongst the group easily. A lovely dinner for our group of 7. Half German, half American. All happy. *reservations suggested. *cash or German EC only. Total: 200 euros with tip. Not bad at all for the quality and panache of the evening."
3,"Had a good lunch at ROK during their quiet opening. The procedure is to take a pager at the front, order and scan in the back, they page you, and then you pay with the pager. A little complicated, to say the least. Had the special pizza of the day, which was pretty tasty (see photo caption). Prices were a little higher than normal, but the atmosphere is nice, and food is good. Will be back."
4,"Leckere Pastagerichte mit Salatbeilage auf Wunsch. Bei Rita schmeckts wirklich prima, ideal fuer den Business Lunch. Im Sommer kann man nett draussen sitzen. Einzig die  guenstige  Preisgestaltung bleibt undurchsichtig: mal kostet Salat extra, mal nicht."
3,"Beautiful ""park"" in the middle of a hectic part of the city. Easy to reach from the Alsterkrug Hotel, where we stayed. Not much traffic we met 5 people on a sunny August Monday afternoon, but be aware of the sometimes speeding cyclists ;-) !! You can walk around the lake and the ""Moor"" easily in an hour, or spent much more if you follow each and every trail. Especially if you observe the cute little houses, with their accurate design and trimmed lawn (this is Germany ;-)  and of course some garden gnomes of the ""Kleingartenverein"" parcels around the Moor."
4,"A very nice hidden cafe;  if you're somewhere around you should definitely visit and sit outside! (As long as the weather allows that is). I enjoy their quiche and breakfast menus, their friendly staff  and good service"
4,"I feel like I am in an Abbott & Costello movie when talking about this place... ""Where are you going?"" The Daily, ""No, not when, where"" The Daily! ""Ok so you go daily"" ""yes but it's The Daily""!! It could go on and on. But the most important thing here is the food. Not a big coffee drinker so don't ask me how good the coffee the was. The food on the other hand, that I can tell you about. The food here is pretty good and the prices you can't beat. Each day they have a different ""special"" warm meal. However, they always have a choice of delicious soups, hearty pastas, and warm baked potatoes to please the belly. I always seem to get the daily special which my favorite is the lasagna. It just melts in your mouth. The layers of cheese and sauce, and more cheese and more sauce. Ok now I'm hungry. Anyway, to top it all off they have some tasty muffins and cakes as well. Just be sure to beat the lunch rush because it will be hard to find a place to sit!"
4,"My wife and I stopped here for dinner after work one night. I've only been in Hamburg for a month or so, but this is easily the best burger I've had in my time here. I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my wife got the Zillertaler Bacon Burger, and both were fantastic. Her's was a little heavy on the sauce, but that didn't really detract from the burger other than to make it messier. Prices were also totally reasonable.They've got great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. They even project whatever is on TV outside as well, so we were able to keep half an eye on the F1 qualifier."
0,"Never go to this place! It's seedy and very unfriendly. Not to mention that the meat is unhealthy. First I couldn't understand why they got so many positive reviews but then I realized that it is owned by a turkish organization that supports Erdogan and some strange (terror?) groups, which, on the other hand, support them by giving positive reviews."
2,The long line gave me a headache but in the end it was worth it !
4,"Very cute crepery with authentic, delicious crepes. Lovely place to sit and relax. Great artwork and decor on the walls, with paintings by French artists.  Staff/cook are all French. I got the buckwheat salmon and legumes savory crepe, and ""the delicious"" as the sweet crepe. Both were fantastic but I loved the sweet one more. The toasted almonds were a splendid touch.  Highly recommend this place!"
3,An unusual style with a surprise menu. Just tell them what you really cannot eat and they will create something for you. quite a small place so booking is adviseable and at weekends absolutely necessary - its even possible to have a 2 or 3 week waiting list for a weekend booking.
2,"Value for money: far to expensiveService: needs training, to pushyLocation: interestingFood: good to averageBeen there a few more times invited on business expenses, the concept is interesting so is the location, but thats where the good news ends. Food quality and preparation varies and for my taste it's a notch above average. I used to live for several years in Japan and in California and comparing H&H to the benchmark the verdict is a simple one. How to improve: we all know money is made with beverages: Train your staff to stop being pushy. I am the guest and I will let you know if and when I want a new bottle of whatever. Train your staff on products you offer and of course on  the daily menue. To stay polite I will not post the answers I received on simple questions. Yes you have a nice winelist but where is some ""exquisit"" sake to go with ...? Lastly: attitude ... You want to play in the major league? Well you certainly have the right foundation, but there there is plentiful to improve if you really want to get there. Treat EVERY guest with respect not only your so called whatever VIPs. H&H has a good name in Hamburg I was told, but a name I can not eat, smell or drink for that matter. You guys can do far better. At present it is only 3/5 stars with the third one for the potential. Will be there again in late May. Hopefully we can see some kind of improvement."
4,"The best breakfast in the city. Really advisable. Studentenfrühstück only 5,50EUR. And coffee as much as you want. The atmosphere is really comfi and when the sun is shining you can sit outside and feel the Schanzenvibe. In the peak time it's quite crowded. So get up early enough or reserve a table."
3,"Oh, Hamburg. People tout you as a place for business which may equal boring, but I don't think so.Strand Pauli is proof of nights that you only dream about in your summer fantasies. Strandpauli is also proof that Germans LOVE their beach bars. It is here where the beach scene is created and lived over and over again: sand at your feet, a bonfire to keep you warm at night, refreshing summery drinks (caipirinha? mojito? you got it) and lots of outdoor seating so you can appreciate the views of the harbor.Cocktail prices hover around €6.50 per long drink or for a short glass of Sapphire & Tonic.Good times, bro."
4,"Brilliant. Very impressed with this place. Had a lovely lamb steak with a honey-mustard sauce and figs. Very reasonably priced, stylish and friendly. The place was full on a Monday evening  that says everything."
2,"The food is what one typically finds in Greek restaurants in Hamburg. The atmosphere is nicer than in many places, but often loud. It's a great place for a dinner out with a group of friends, but not the ideal place for a quiet dinner in two."
4,Best coffee in town period. Try the pecorino or the homemade-cheese bagel. I saw yuppies and also mechanics take their coffee there the stuff doesn't care. Also try the sweet Cortado.
3,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a while back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have to like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Recently for example had the coconut milk and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
2,"You really feel like you are on the beach. Wonderful but it remembers a bit on a package tour. Over all the prices. Too expensive. And going to the toilet costs extra.But the excuse is good: The view, the sand.. the summerfeeling."
4,"Great food, fantastic service... Loved the ambience"
4,"Best Dim Sum House in Hamburg! After a long but worthwhile wait, Restaurant Mr He finally reopened (after their neighbour burnt down). We went hoping everything would still taste as delicious and authentic as it did and we were not disappointed! The same super friendly waitress was there. The custard buns are to die for, which we always order a portion to takeaway, and so are the xo sauce turnip cakes and pretty much just everything. We highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Cantonese dishes. The prices are worth paying for the quality food and they're not more expensive than other dim sum places."
2,"I don't know too many vegan places and being vegetarian, I simply enjoyed having the full choice of the menu :-) The dishes are Asian and I was very satisfied with my veggies and cashews in a slightly coconutty sauce. Service is friendly too and even though we had booked for 8, our nine-plus-dog group was accommodated without problems. There is no alcohol but a number of juice and tea options instead. You can even get vegan cakes and icecream. The only drawback - the place could really have been cleaner with some stains on the tablecloth covered by the place mats. Otherwise it's a lovely place, brightly lit and with some quirky decorations making it very cheerful."
4,"if you haven't been there, go there! the miniaturwunderland is a incredible place. suited in beautiful old warehouses of the hamburger speicherstadt two model railway freaks built the worlds biggest model railway. they started 2001 with a model of the hamburg harbour but since then the wonderland has grown continuesly year by year. the alps, norway, switzerland, usa, etc. everything is sculptured beautifully and filled with tons of details (which are the true highlights of the hole thing, because you can find millions of funny and bizarre everyday situations, which often refer to current news/events, i.e. strike of the bundsbahn 2007). and it is not only about railways, the whole thing is a computer controlled super system, which includes day and night changes every five minutes, streets full of traffic, police and fire brigade operations, boats travelling on the seas and in the harbour, etc... amazing! and it is getting bigger and bigger every day..."
3,"After university my friend and I used to come here for cup of coffee and snack. We really loved sitting outside on their cute small table and chairs on the vibrant and artsy street in Sternschanze.Nice and welcoming decor, attentive staff and delicious food.Definitely come here if you want to have a nice ambiance with friends."
4,Service was amazing! Atmosphere was also great. I got bacon cheeseburger on a dark bun and sweet potato fries. The texture and flavors were well balanced and very satisfying. The food was also presented beautifully. I plan on returning soon!
3,"Despite being really close to the office, I hadn't yet been to Brook - maybe because it is a little bit more expensive than our usual quick lunch places! However, I thoroughly recommend it as lunchtime business venue or evening romantic spot. Situated on the busy Bei den Muhren, overlooking the water, we were able to watch the usual Hamburg weather (bright sunshine then aggressive winds and then torrential rain) rush past in the space of a relaxing 1.5 hours The restaurant itself is large and spacious with an open and modern design. Window tables such as we had I think will be much more pleasant than the inner tables. The 3 course daily lunch menu was excellent and very decent value for this quality of food: A lovely and delicate / frothy asparagus soup, tuna steak on a tomato risotto and a delicate fruit tart with ice-cream. Only minor quibble would be the speed of service - fine for a leisurely evening meal, but perhaps a little slow for a lunchtime off the set menu. But overall a really good discovery. I will be back."
3,With its glorious trees and other greenery the outside spaces here are a great place to sit out in during the day doing a bit of people watching or just listening to the wind through the branches.Internally it's comfortable & inviting with decent service and the ostrich wrap and goats cheese salad make for a great sharing combination.
4,SO FUN. Learned a lot! Would definitely do it again.
3,"A delightful restaurant.  We came here looking for a place to have a casual meal and drink whilst not being harrassed to keep buying more refreshments and could sit and chat without feeling like it was time to leave.There is the ground level restaurant which is rather snug the only table left was next to the toilet so we didn't fancy that (there is a reason no one sat there).  We were then told that downstairs has more space.  To get downstairs you come out of the restaurant and down the stairs from street level.  A cosy 'tavern' type place with plenty of space.  The waitress was happy and they were able to provide me with a English menu (yeah, I know..).  Food was simple but looked tasty and very reasonably priced I felt.  We opted for the recommended burger with fried potatoes (not chips as we know it).  Burger came and was huge with a nice bowl of friend potatoes.  The burger was delicious and can see why it was recommended. I didn't think I was very hungry but managed to eat every last morsel of food.We were able to stay there for hours without being harrassed.  Waitress was friendly and service was prompt I have not complaints about this place and it was a very reasonable price.  2 good size chicken burgers with all the trimmings and fried potatoes along with a few alcoholic drinks and 2 hot chocolates all for €31.00.  After that meal I was still feeling full and skipped breakfast the next morning!My only negative is that they do not take credit card payments and only cash.  Wise thing to know before going there."
3,"My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner - first birthday in Hamburg! I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience here. Located in the lovely neighborhood of Eppendorf, the restaurant is situated on a street near other shops and restaurants, but it's not super bustling. The setting is great for a nice intimate dinner for two or with a few friends.You get two tasting menu options for 108€. The differences in the menus are slight, with the first course and last course being different, otherwise all dishes in between are the same. We went with Nouri's Menu (that's the chef). The courses included the following:1. Foie Gras 2. Tartar of Beef 3. Couscous with 7 vegetables4. Monkfish5. Nouri's main course - braised ox6. Almond foam with mint granité and apricot7. Roses sorbetAll courses were plated beautifully! Each course was also bursting with flavor and the flavor combinations were quite interesting. I was definitely able to detect all the Moroccan influences. In regards to the food, I wouldn't say it was the best Michelin star meal I've had, but it's near the top of my list for overall experience, especially for presentation. If you have a few extra Euros sitting around, I'd recommend an evening at Piment."
4,"Authentic, old school German atmosphere combined with some German Staples. It's a great environment to experience. And of course, the beer is plentiful. Schnitzel and basically any Würst are safe choices for your first forray or 75th return visit."
4,"Beside its small room, the coffee here is good, the staff is nice and there is wifi. I can comfortably seat on a sofa with my computer, take the WiFi (probably not from there but it works nicely), and spend hours. Their cappuccinos are big!"
4,"DaCaio is my favorite place to eat when I travel to Hamburg.  There is a dish called ""Del Boss"" that is consistently mind blowing and I think about it longingly when I'm far from Hamburg.  Check it out, you don't be disappointed.  Also had the tagliatelle for the first time today at lunch and it too was incredible!  Love it!"
3,"Eating here could be classed as an adventure. Firstly, finding it, is rather awkward due to the huge amount of building work going on in the nearby hafencity and the fact it is hidden under a railway bridge. Then theres the quirky 15 degree interior, which looks and feels like you are sliding slowly into the Elbe canal. Added to all this, is the randomness of the seating arrangements, where you could be sitting next to anyone, (and your food could be sliding slowly down the table towards your new friends). However, these can all be considered plus sides as it is a completley unexpected, and quite wonderful experience. The food is excellent, the chef knowing pretty much all theres is to know about original German food, the atmosphere is very friendly (perhaps because its so small and cosy) the drinks are good (standard), and the cost is reasonable. If you fancy a bit of an adventure and are looking to experience something a little different, then this is definately the place. The only downside is that its best to go when its busy to get the true feeling of the place."
4,"I might have found a new favorite coffee place in Hamburg! They seem to roast their own coffee and it actually tastes really good. We had an Americano and a Cappuccino. Both tasted aromatic. Their waffles are famous, so we had to try one with Nutella and were not disappointed! Their cheesecakes are very good as well! I almost liked it more than their waffles. It's a nice place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon with friends and family."
1,"Borchers is a local bar and restaurant in Eppendorf, with a large dining room and an even bigger outdoor patio and sidewalk seating area. It's the kind of place that I can imagine has been here for years, and like a certain bar in Boston, everyone might just know your name.The atmosphere is nice, the service is friendly, and the food is edible, but none of it seems to come together into a cohesive dining experience for me.On one visit I had the Seelachs (pollack?) with potato salad, and on another visit I had the Wiener Schnitzel with white asparagus, potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. The fish was decent, but the Wiener Schnitzel was unremarkable, and the asparagus was overcooked.I suspect Borchers is a great place to sit outside and drink beer on a warm day, but the food is just not that good."
3,"Update:I'm here without dogs and babies, so my experience is different from other negative reviews I've read. I can see the appeal of this place: it lies in its well-designed, cozy, country-style atmosphere, in its warmth. December 29, 2012Darn! Nothing on their Facebook page says they would be closed for Christmas. :("
2,"As usual took half an hour to queue to get in here, then we were sat in the window so the queue could get then watch us eat our meal. The food is OK, the service friendly and I get the local loyalty from a Hamburg chain-done-good but each time I visit Block House I vow never again. There are a lot of much better places to eat in Hamburg."
3,"I have to admit, I was intrigued by the menu featuring a salad with carmel corn. Salad was great and Iberian pork fabulous. Service was also very good. Enjoyed the meal."
2,"Es ist ok, overall. I'm from California and have consumed countless burritos in the States...from the States that really matter when it comes to Mexican cuisine. (I've also been to Mexico a few times.)How does the food here compare? It's not too bad...really. The flavors were ok...maybe just lacking that delicious and dirty pig-fat flavoring from the grill. I enjoyed the burrito much more than the ""enchilada"" as the burrito was prepared much more like how they should be.Service was very friendly and the decor and atmosphere actually felt very SoCal-ish...think La Lucha Libre in SD, but less pink and gaudy and more punk."
3,"Ah Rosi's Bar.. it's another of the almost identical bars on that side of Hamburger Berg. That mean's it's actually a pretty good bar, but you could just as easily pick any of 5-10 bars within 50 yards and have the same evening. - popular music? check.- dance floor? check.- cheap(ish) drinks? check.- good crowd? check.- free entry? check.- table football? check. Did I just copy/paste that review? Did someone copy/paste this bar?"
3,"We enjoyed an early dinner at Campo da Franco on a recent Saturday evening. The weather was great, so we sat outdoors in their patio, which despite being adjacent to a major thoroughfare, was fairly quiet and calm. The staff is super-friendly; we mostly communicated in German, but they were there to help us in English when we stumbled. The crew seems legit Italian, and they do a nice job. I had the eponymous Pizza Campo (arugula, spicy salami, cherry tomatoes, Parmesan), and it was delicious. Also had some insalata caprese on the side, which was very fresh and tasty. My family also enjoyed their meals, and we had some nice wines by the glass to go with everything. All in all, a great experience with good food. We'll be back."
2,"Wildfleisch burgers! Too bad I did not know what wildfleisch was until I got home from my dinner at Edelsatt and decided to look it up. I definitely like the all around organic offerings at Edelsatt as well as the idea of a venison burger patty. I ordered the Edelsatt burger. This was a hamburger that called for the use of forks and knives. Not knowing it was venison, the patty did strike me as odd. It appeared to me that the venison meat was not grounded well enough, and then was smashed together into a burger patty; it was kind of like a piece of steak that fell apart to easily when you bit into it. It's hard to describe. There wasn't enough salt on the patty either for my taste. The bio bread was difficult to cut or even bite into. My burger devolved into a messy heap. I did like the mayo and the grilled onions. Others have complained about the fries, but I rather liked them a tad soft. I washed it all down with a rhubarb fritz cola. It was 9€ for the burger plus 3.50€ for the added fries and drink. The restaurant itself is a cool spot. I dig the decor. The food came out fast and the staff was very friendly. The hubby and I decided, possibly in unison, that we would likely not order the burgers again. That is, unless they make it feel more like an actual burger patty. I would like to try the currywurst, so I'll be coming back at least for that."
4,"Awesome park for a chill time after work and at weekends. There is a huge greenfield, just bring a blanket, some food and you're set. We played viking chess, people asked to join and we had a good time playing viking chess with strangers.Highly recommended!"
4,"A nice place with friendly stuff , and the food is AMAZING !! Highly recommend this place !"
4,"Don't skip this. Bigger than you think, with lots of attention to detail.  Easy access. Not suitable for wheelchairs (in my opinion) and the scenery switches from day to night very regularly. You can also have a view behind the scenes."
1,"Limited menu (5 main course besides burgers) but at least they had an English version! Ordered the burrata, which at 18.5€ was pricey but that's because it is about three times normal size. Sadly, it lacked flavor and didn't have the soft, buttery consistency I was hoping for. Also ordered a burger with melted onions. Came so full of creamy sauce it was dripping. Had to scrape a ton of extra mayo sauce off to be edible. Tasted ok, but not worth the trouble. Also, don't say yes when they all you if you want one dish before another... They won't put in the order for your second until your first is gone (even if it's a huge barrata big enough for 4 people). Sat awkwardly waiting for my burger for over half an hour before she asked if I finally wanted it... Uhgg. This place was meh, and I wouldn't return."
3,A very small place with some great fish dishes. I had the classic fish and chips which was very well done. The tartare sauce with the fish was delicious and made the fish taste even better.The chips were not great but not bad either. Recommended if you're a hard core fish fan.
4,"Ham-Burgers in Hamburg Germany yes please! Especially if it here. This place has burger flavors to try more than once. Lunch time was a bit busy but rightfully so for good food.i chose the baked potato instead of fries and I'm glad I did. If anything I would just go for that and a burger on the side.  While I'm not a salad eater they do make them fresh right in front of you and the portion is large. And as delicious as they looked I would even eat one. Who doesn't want burgers and beer. Well you can get both here, enjoy a table outside and people watch as they pass in a hurry to get to their next destination.  My husband upgraded his champion burger and it was far better than my own. They also offer no bun options and a blue cheese burger that I heard was really good too.  What seems to be a chain restaurant or fast food was not like anything I'm use to in the US.  I would definitely go back. The cashiers were friendly and informative and offered a smile with every meal purchase. But don't expect fast food service if they are busy everything is made to order. But for me that is worth the wait."
3,Don't know much about sushi. But at least that one was the best i've ever had. I recommend the beef topping.
3,"Had a great dinner here last night. I'm going to go ahead and give them 4 stars even though I do have two things to quib about. Were these resolved they easily get 5 stars. One is the fact that they have a ventilation system which is necessary to keep the place from stinking like the kitchen. At the same time, this creates a draft on half the seats which really isn't something you want. We had to change seats in the hope of not waking up the next day with sore necks. Luckily we received a table upstairs and had the whole level to ourselves which was very much to our liking. Second complaint is the wine pricing. By the glass, you only get 0,1 servings at prices which are usually for 0,2 size servings. Not a major big deal but still kind of high for the rest of the menu's very positive notes. There is also a 0,25 size serving but for two people this is also poor sizing. Anyway, these were very minor complaints on my end. On a very positive note service here is great. Super nice waitress who was more than attentive the whole evening and very helpful in making choices off the menu. We both had the pasta with truffles which was really good. Further, and I usually wouldn't comment on this, the bread served was amazing. Super tasty and warm which when eaten with the high quality olive oil rounded out our meal nicely. We also had dessert and were very impressed. We ordered the pistachio tarte and the chocolate tart which were both filled with creamy fillings. Dessert was the highlight of the meal. The interior is still, after being open a year, like new. I really like the mix of styling and it's a very comfortable atmosphere (outside of the draft). We'll definitely be back soon as this could easily become a favorite Italian place in the Innenstadt. I am making a point of coming back and trying it out for lunch when I have business appointments."
3,"Great buffet, can't wait to go again. Plan to workout after binge-eating on the delicious but oily biryani!"
3,"A good spot! Menu is heavy on burgers (probably shouldn't be surprised, though), but the salad -- the salad was amazing. Still thinking about it a day later. If I were here longer I'd go back!"
3,"Nice little family-owned italian bistro in the Altstadt. The pasta menu isn't very diverse but the prices are decent and the service is warm and friendly. Unfortunately the place is rather small and doesn't have proper organization for rain-free outside seating, so make sure to show up with a small party on a sunny day. EDIT: The woman running this joint will give you stares if you don't finish your food!"
3,"The best place for a hamburger in Hamburg.Always busy mainly because of the location on Jungfernsteig but also down to the speed, service and quality of what's on offer.Great value, cheaper and a lot nicer than a McDonalds!As a tip on the best time to come i would suggest Sundays as you can get served within a few minutes and eadily find somewhere to sit."
0,Awful service. Rate 1star just because there is no option of 0star rating. Big disappointment
3,"It is amusing to travel from America to Hamburg to get a hamburger made with American beef in a somewhat Americanized restaurant, but the results are anything but amusing. The burger had the highest beef to bread ratio I have seen. I usually order burgers medium to be safe, but luckily the waitress pointed out this would be a mistake here and they shouldn't be cooked past medium rare.The filthy harry was good enough that I couldn't help but order it each time I came here. Fries are also tasty. The burger is on the expensive side, but for the quality and quantity that you receive it is reasonable. Also it was a bit of a kick to see Anchor Steam beer on the menu."
3,"We went for dinner on a Thursday and it was quite quiet, but this may also be due to the bad weather outside which doesn't really attract walk in customers. We had a three course menu with the accompanying wines and thought it was pretty good. The soup was very good, the fish was a huge portion and tasted good, but wasn't hot anymore. Dessert was a chocolate tarte which I believe should have been with a liquid core, which it wasn't The server was very nice and friendly, though a bit unsure at times. With better weather we would come back."
4,"One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Coffee was well brewed and their flat white really nice (comes with two tiny biscuits). Their French breakfast is really generous, with nice fresh bread, 7 delicious French cheeses with fig mustard and some red berry marmelade, and a truly airy and spectacular butter croissant. And their special out of menu Eggs Benedict were absolutely perfect. Really fresh, free range eggs, beautifully poached with yellow yolks and super crunchy bacon. Swoon. Already made a reservation for next week, as I am hosting guests!"
4,another treasure in the industrial West side on the way to the football stadium. great north German fare. try the rotbarsch filet. the bratkartoffeln is a bit too oily for my taste. also the fish soup! lots of chunky fish pieces and shrimps. wholesome food for the soul. lecker!
4,"Just perfect! I could not decide what to eat so I tried everything -aaahhh! Don't regret on single order. All was delish!! Eggs Florentine, vegan pancake, vegan french toast and vegan chocolate cupcake. Best breakfast for dinner I have had in a long while. Kind of glad I don't live here yet. Will definitely come back.You can sit outside or inside. Service is fast and very friendly. They speak German and English. Have great 80s-90s music running in the background. Really in love with the food. Only thing they are missing is glutenfree options. Hope they will add these. I am in love!! Restaurant is close to public transportation, too. You have to come here if you love breakfasts...even for dinner or any time of the day!"
1,"I really tried to like it because of good comments I heard from friends. However, I can't say that my experience was great. I ordered the Avocado Burger, and so did two other colleagues. When the burgers arrived, they all looked very different (I know we ordered different buns) but overall, the patties and the presentation was way too off. Mine looked flat and uninspiring. The flavor was not that bad, but maybe not worth the high price."
3,"Amazing cute little restaurant. Ordered the meatballs, two different salads, hotdogs and the chocolate dessert. All really fantastic dishes with great flavors. Ambiance is great very Scandinavian with a ton of personality. There's big common tables, chairs, chandeliers and smaller wood tables for more intimates dinners. Overall this is a great place to have pleasant lunch or dinner."
4,one of best pho in town.
3,"If you are in Hamburg you absolutely must come to eat here, since the food here is the best!The food is so freaking amazing, the prices are great, service awesome and the ambience was perfect.I wish they could deliver to Berlin haha! I crave their bowl of pho all the time."
3,"Ate here twice.  Had the kuzu sis and left very satisfied and full.  The dish came with many sides of salad, rice, roasted peppers, sauces erc.  The lambe kenob itself came fresh and piping hot.  The counter staff remind of the soup nazi on Seinfeld but the table server was very polite and friendly.  On my second visit, I tried a donair which tasted  very clean."
4,"Thamers must be one of the oldest pubs in Hamburg, the bar looks positively ancient. The beer selection is interesting (they are the only bar that I've found to sell Duckstein Weizen) and the food looks great - I've only ever had the goulash soup and it was the best I've had in Hamburg. If there is one small problem, then it's that the bar is quite, er, small. Each time I've been I've managed to get the last table, but I've never been at what I would consider a peak time"
4,"These type of traditional places are disappearing quickly...don't miss this one. Close to the Hauptbahnhof, great for a quick meal and a beer!"
2,Convenient and easy but the döner meat isn't the best... there are better places in town. The service is okay. The other snacks are okay. The seating is. Good.
4,"Went there with my boyfriend for our first night in Hamburg! Both of us started with a soup and then we had the seitan-Gyros plate which was delicious! The waiter was really nice too! For two soups, two gyros and a bottle of water we paid 53€, which is a bit on the pricier side but I would still highly recommend it!"
4,"This is it. One if the most authentic asian restaurants in all of Hamburg. Amazing food for a fair price, hidden away in Hamburg Jenfeld - really of the grid. But don't let that stop you from treating yourself to the most authentic and delicious vietnamese food you'll ever get this far away from Hanoi. And boy are you in for a treat. The food is amazing! Flavourful with a home cooked vibe to the dishes, served with fresh and fragrant herbs, spicy chilies and refreshing drinks. Satisfaction guaranteed! The service is efficient, friendly and accommodating. I once turned up with a friend of mine minutes after closing and they still served us and where so nice to us, even though we stalled their much deserved closing time. Thank you once again! The decor used to be typical to Asian Street Food restaurants (very basic) but they changed all that and redid the restaurant. Purists, regulars and people in the know may shrug off the redesign but I think its great. Hopefully people whom are not accustomed to asian Street Food won't be dissuaded by the backroom flair any longer. The little trip to Jenfeld is time well spent. As a tip, get there on a saturday or sunday morning. The place is bursting with people from all walks of life. Asian families dressed to the nines, groups of young people looking a little hung over from last night, old wrinkly asians all busy chatting away and most likely me, taking the whole scenery in, slurping my jumbo Pho and just being content. I'll see you there!"
4,"Great spot for dim sum in Hamburg! Tried lots of different dishes and enjoyed them all. Tasty and authentic Chinese food in the heart of Hamburg close to the Hauptbahnhof. Some of the food can take a while but it's worth the wait! FYI - They don't take reservations, so you just have to try your luck."
2,"Staff here are really super friendly! They seem serious about their coffee with lots of options on the menu.But it's not a cozy or comfortable place where I'd want to hang out for long, a second drink etc..My non-coffee drink (chai latte) was rather lukewarm, flavour on the dull side. The many happy Yelp voices suggest that coffee drinkers might be luckier here."
4,"I love going to Oma's Apotheke when I'm hungry - the menu selection is wide and the prices are affordable, I've never left Oma's Apotheke hungry and have always enjoyed everything they've put in front of me. Oma's Apotheke is on the corner of Schanzenstrasse, opposite the S-bahn station, which makes it very central and a great place to meet friends for a bite to eat. The large tables allow larger groups to sit together, when we're there we normally fill up a table or two (and all manage to find something on the menu, including the veggies!)."
4,"Epitome of Hamburger Berg. It has it all: coolness, attitude, tunes, drinks Music is great. It can get very crowded on the dancefloor. But that's exactly what I like about it: people come to have fun and shake their bones to their favourite beats. It's as simple as that. My favourite @Reeperbahn"
2,i guess i should try it again.. first time wasn't really that good. not like something was bad  that borshch is just not for my taste
2,I found the atmosphere to be very cool. The place was full. A friend and I from Canada have been on a mission to find awesome Asian street food. This place unfortunately did not deliver. We ordered the spring rolls to start. The filling was good but the spring was burnt. For our mains I ordered the chicken pho and I asked for extra veggies like in the veggie pho. The broth was ok. The noddles and  veggies were also over cooked. My friend ordered the crispy noodles with beef and veggies. She liked her dish  but didn't love it. I don't know if I would go back. My go to Asian street food is still Quan Do in the city! It's amazing !
3,"Like usual, super Burger and tasty Cocktails.Insiders will always go the roof, great Lounge feelingand super View to the Elbe River.(Good Weather Only)Side Area of the Roof is Rain- and Wind protected.Don't miss it for a Tour through Hamburg."
2,"A pretty good burger here although it's more than just burgers and not really a restaurant. A bit on the pricy side but a good choice and good quality. A nice touch is them giving your order a local street name rather than a number, e.g. Jaguarstieg or Königstraße."
4,"Roth is a great little cosy pub/restaurant. However, if I'm honest I've never eaten here, so I'm just reviewing it as a pub. They have Rothaus Tannenzäpfle on tap, along with quite a few Irish beers, including Guiness and Murphys, so they have the beer pretty much nailed. The staff are friendly enough, and because of the restaurant side of things you get table service for your beer, which is nice. I'll have to try the food sometime"
4,"My husband and I bought combo tickets to the zoo and the aquarium (60 euros altogether), and after three hours enjoying the zoo, I wasn't sure that I had the stamina to tour the aquarium. I'm so glad that I powered through, because it was even better than the zoo! My husband does not speak or read any German, and my competency is slightly above elementary, but we found that more of the signage at the aquarium is in both English and German than the signage in the zoo. Even though the name clearly reads ""tropics/aquarium,"" I was expecting to see only water creatures. Wrong: this is where the lemurs and lizards and snakes live, too! I was expecting to see the lemurs in the zoo portion, but no, they are the first exhibit one encounters in the ""tropics/aquarium"" part. I loved the design of the space: the maze-like way one moves from exhibit to exhibit, the seemingly hand-written and hand-drawn signs, and the neat way that the environs of the smaller animals are presented in wooden cabinets as in the Renaissance cabinet of curiosities. Imagine an aquarium and zoo presented in a venue like Sir John Sloane's Museum in London, and that's very close to what one encounters here. If we had been pressed for time and could have only done one venue, I would choose here over the actual zoo, it's so good."
4,"Super! It is my Wednesday tradition now. I always order No 25, Klein gemuseteller mit Dönner . Sorry about the spelling. I tried my best. Sometimes I tried No 38 and something on the special. The food is good and worth its price."
2,"This tourist spot has its ""cool factor"" being one of the biggest miniature displays of its kind in the world, but the crowded Disneyland long lines of pushing and shoving while walking around inside of this destination, steals away from the magic of the Wonderland, because you wonder if you will ever get to see something up close, because there are so many cute kids running around pointing and cheering in awe.  You feel kinda like a jerk if you do not offer your spot to one of these sweet faced angels to get a closer peek before you.  If and when it is not overly crowded, which is hardly the case as this is a very popular tourist spot for not just kids but also adults, the displays are really fascinating. They have an airplane runway where you actually see model planes from most international carriers, I mean, I am Thai and I even saw a Thai Airways plane!  You get to watch them slowly pull out onto the runway like a real plane then take off into the sky complete with sounds of the engines!Most of the displays are European and being an American, it is cool to see, but hard to identify with the land markings as much as a European child or adult would recognize the details better.  They have the Alps, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavian countries, and even the USA, particularly the Vegas display interested me.  There is a mixture of switching from day to night scenes in the rooms, and also an entire water display  going into the Northern Scandinavian countries. My favorite miniature area was Hamburg, because I live here and it was cool to recognize the layout of the city, see the Hafencity, the churches, the super cool HSV football stadium complete with HSV fans in the seats,  etc..... Miniature displays are also more identifiable with people if they personally know the thing or place well that is being miniaturized because we all like to check for accuracy and are amazed at the details and intricate work that goes into these ornate displays.Tip: Try to either go really early in the day when it opens or really later in the day before it is about to close, otherwise, it is often too crowded to see anything and you feel rushed to look at move on so you are not blocking the way for others to see."
4,Came in here not particularly hungry but after seeing the size of the portions ended up eating quite a bit! Meat was so tender and tasty and I especially liked the freshness of the salad and the bread was just lovely.
3,"ruehrei war lecker, orientalisches Fruehstueck haette groesser ausfallen koennen"
0,"I have never before in my life returned sushi to the chef, until my unfortunate encounter at Sushi Circle. I payed for an all-you-can-eat as a recommendation from a friend, and ended up having half a piece of nigiri, and asking for my money back. Up until this point, I must have eaten at about a hundred some-odd Sushi eateries - only a trickle served worse Sushi and provided a worse experience than at Sushi Circle. I have not grown up in a culture which serves sushi as a cultural thing (Read: I am not Japanese) but would like to be able to say that I have had enough experience with Sushi to be able to note when it's well made, or the product of ""Raw fish slackery"". I fear ""Sushi Circle"" falls into the latter category. To avoid rambling on in generic terms, here's what I didn't like about Sushi Circle's sushi experience: - The Rice/Vinegar ratio. The rice was tasteless, non-sticky, and the nigiri was falling apart. - The fish.With fresh fish, my teeth sink into the sushi. With this stuff, I needed to put up a fight. - The service.If I ask for nigiri without wassabi wedged between the rice and the fish, do I have to wait half an hour? - The selection. ""All you can eat"" rounds are not always known for their marvelous selection, but having 4 types of sushi on the conveyor belt is rather poor. - The seating.Sushi circle's establishment is built in such a way where you need to squirm and crawl to get out of your seat, or to allow others to pass by you. Very disappointed and will not return under any circumstances."
3,"The Hamburg Dungeon is an interactive journey through the dark history of Hamburg, with actors explaining about e.g. Black Death, the great fire or pirate Störtebeker. Within groups you enter room by room, where the actors wait for you. Everything is a little spooky and therefore there is a minimum age of 10 years old to enter the Dungeon. Enjoy!"
3,"Very fun to visit and a cool art experience, but very tiring! I love art, but without a guide or audio guide I had no natural path to follow. I ended up viewing only a portion of the art works before we all grew tired. The cafe was inexpensive and served delicious cake For future visitors who also prefer not having a guide, I recommend using a map or consulting with the staff before you embargo on the journey. Altogether the museum is breathtaking, and worth the visit."
1,"A big Bavarian style bar with litre masses of beer, staff in Bavarian costume. the food is quite good and the place is fun with a group of people. The staff could be more friendly."
3,"nice burrito place in the Grindelviertel. I've been to the one at Osterstrasse before, but here it was a little more complicated to order your burrito with your choice of all the different toppings. Kinda like ordering a subway sandwich. But my burrito was pretty tasty. The should have some sauces on the table, however, and I didn't like my friends' Guacamole too much."
2,"I enjoyed a lunch here with some coworkers. The environment is really nice, it looks like a typical German restaurant. The location is really good, basically in the city center, you can easily reach it from the U-Bahn. The quality of food was good, I took a ""Jägerschnitzel"". Unfortunately, the service was a bit low. They took more than 30 mins to deliver the dishes..."
4,"Affordable, tasty, and excellent service. I only had the pea soup but I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, as my meal was delicious and everything around me looked lovely too."
4,"My favorite cafe in Hamburg. Great coffee, many different brewing methods and types of filtered coffee. I love how they serve them. I even bought a few of their cups. Very spacious with view of the canal, friendly staff, but the food is hands down the best thing about this place. Everything I ordered is very well presented and tastes delicious!! Pouched eggs with avocado, paninis, açai bowl, waffles, especially the apple-basil compote!! And if you are lucky, you will see their cute french bulldog hanging out in the corner."
4,Excellent! Once of the best Thai meals I've had outside of Thailand.
4,After sitting here a full sunday afternoon recovering from the night before this place really showed its merits. The music was perfect sunday chill music and the choise between strong and normal apple cider was a true blessing.
3,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Joh Albrecht. Been there several times. If I have friends visiting Hamburg, it is probably the place I take them to. They got a good view of the canal if you are lucking getting a table next to the window. They have really good Flammkuchen. I've ordered it every time I got there. I've tried schweinshaxe and schnitzel once or twice. Not impressive. Beer is good though. The place is good for group. They have a lot of long tables."
0,"Nice cafe with unfortunately really unfriendly and rude service. I can understand stress from the workers when the line is long and there are a lot of people, but no need to slam plates on the counter and roll your eyes at customers."
2,"I wasn't really impressed with this place. I figured I had to get a burger if I was going to be in Hamburg, but the meat lacked seasoning, all the fresh ingredients were cold and the cheese wasn't melted. These are some of the most important parts about a good burger. Also, they don't accept American credit cards so make sure you have cash. (I walked around for awhile looking for an ATM, that was fine!) The truffle mayo sauce is good and the ketchup is regular ketchup. The ""large"" fizzy water was pretty small in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend. I went in on a Sunday around 8:00 and sat right away since I was by myself. Service was pretty quick."
4,"Great burgers, nice staff, and plenty of outside seating protected from the rain."
4,"Always my first choice when going out to eat in Hamburg, friendly atmosphere and delicious food. Try the Lamb rack it's always my first choice, but the other dishes are also delicious. And of course the Mezze as to start of the meal. The price point is also more than fair with this quality of food."
4,"Excellent authentic food and atmosphere, great and friendly staff who went out of the way to seat us two on a booked out Saturday evening. You would never guess what a treasure is hidden inside by the exterior of the place, or by the location... so keep it a secret;)"
2,"I came here during a night out with a friend last week and it was OK. We were looking for quick easy food that wasn't Italian (as he is Italian!) so coming out of a nearby bar saw this place and the hundred or so people inside and decided to check it out. We didn't even realise it was Chinese until we were inside and nearly walked out - often they are just overpriced buffets - but we had a quick look at the food area and decided to stay. This place seems to differ from the usual all you can eat places because there is a pretty good selection of raw ingredients to choose from which are then stir fried in front of you. Plenty of choice of starters, deserts, sushi; enough to fill you up either before or after a jaunt down the reeperbahn! So at just 50 euro including AYCE food for 2, and 2 large beers it was OK. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner for 2 as its big brash and noisy but for pre or post booze fuel stop its perfectly acceptable."
4,"Really good oriental food. A really nice and cosy place too. Looks good from the outside as it does from the inside. The food is fresh and quick for a very reasonable price. It was crowded but not too loud. I went there with two friends. We all had different meals but everything arrived at the same time. The kumpir was perfectly cooked and the topping was delicious. My friend had a mixed starter plate which we shared but couldn't finish at all. The tea was perfect with the flavoures of our meals.Service was pretty friendly as well. Actually as I write this review, I am getting hungry and want to go there immediately I recommend this place for anyone who wants solid, good food and nice atmosphere before going out."
2,"A very standard place in Ottensen. Nice but nothing extraordinary. I am quite surprised at how often this place fills up. The food is average if that. The interior is about the same as 50 other places in Hamburg. The crowd is also your typical Ottensen hipster-wannabe. If in the area, stop in and grab some food but don't bring extensive expectations or foresee a memorable evening. Just a local place to grab food and beer."
4,"Wow. I used to live in Munich when I was a kid and have fond memories of eating Spätzle. Eating the Spätzle here was like that scene from Ratatouille, where the food critic takes that bite of food and is transported to his youth. The Spätzle is handmade and delicious. They seem to take great care to source quality ingredients. I had the cheese Spätzle with onions and bacon. I also requested a little of their brown sauce/gravy on the side. This place is also vegan friendly, with vegan options of most of their dishes. Would definitely recommend this place."
4,"My husband and I were craving a US diner style breakfast and found Mamalicious on Yelp. It by far surpassed our expectations and absolutely hit the spot for breakfast.We ordered the original eggs benedict, a side or chocolate chip pancakes and bottomless coffee. Everything was soooooo good.  Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian but the meat substitutes that came on our eggs benedict was delicious even by my bacon-loving husband's standards. The service was very friendly, the price was right, the filter coffee was great and the venue was very cute and cozy. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were there right after they opened. So we will keep that in mind the next time we come back. All in all, I think this will become a favorite of ours in Hamburg. So excited to have found this place!"
4,"AMAZING! Kittles has done everyone in the Qype community a great service by finding out what the hell this bar is actually called. We don't have the concept of nameless bars in the UK, but in works well here. This place is always busy, in a good way. Sofas that would look hideous in your own living room really fit in well with the downbeat decor, think, faded grandeur with a bit of damp. Great place to meet people as you have to sit next to them. Check it out."
4,Looked for a place to eat near the Crowne Plaza and saw the Sangers was close. Went for a short five minute walk for a wonderful meal that was made and prepared with quality and care. Six of us were in the group and not only was the good worth the price the flavor was amazing.
4,"Really great experience, wonderful food and large portions, truly welcoming with the owner's  greeting and seating people. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
4,I love Starbucks so much! This one has one of the best views I've ever seen and free Wi-Fi (log out and in again every 2 hours). Will def come back for more ice chai tea latte
4,"Here you'll find the best burger in Hamburg, bar none. So 5 stars.However, they could really do with redecorating. It feels more like a conference room than the cosy meaty paradise that it should be. Ah well, I'm sure they'll sort that out in time.Back to the food. They have a range of about 10 burgers, all of which are going to set you back about EUR12, so they're not cheap. They are however freshly made, using fresh meat, which allows the server to ask How would you like that cooked? Rare, Medium-rare. I went for medium-rare, which anywhere else in Hamburg would be a recipe for extreme food-poisoning, but here you just get the great extra taste.Extra props for having two blue-cheese burgers on the menu."
4,"Since I moved to Hamburg, I have been searching for the best dim sum place for my weekend ""brunch"", of which I have been doing for years back in my home country. and yes, I am Chinese. I have tried several restaurants, Mei Moon is the real authentic Cantonese one. The owner and chefs are Cantonese, and they have the best taste bud within the whole China. Each dim sum is handmade in house, instead of mass production frozen pieces, which u can buy in chinese supermarket. Highly recommended for people who crave for a good Cantonese yamcha. Thumbs up for the food. However interior and ambient is better at dim sum haus around the corner."
4,"I had a great time here, the bartender knows his job. In the end he made me a Mojito with a Chocolate taste. That was Wonder full. When I'm back in Hamburg i will defintaly go back"
4,"Miniature Wunderland is the world's largest model railway layout, and makes for a super half day out for children (of all ages).Actually, it might be more accurate to say layouts: the exhibition area is an amazing 5,000m2, and there are rooms depicting Austria, Switzerland, different parts of Germany, Scandinavia and even parts of the USA (not the UK, though, alas!). And it isn't just abut trains: one of the most popular exhibits is a huge scale model of Hamburg airport, complete with planes taxiing and taking off, with all the service vehicles scurrying about, and even cars queuing for the car parks!It's hard to describe everything as there is so much to see  and it is as much about the details as it is the scale. As well as trains, planes and cars, there are trams, ski lifts, cable-cars, and even model ships moving through the fjord in the Norwegian section  where the water tank even has a tide. Some areas are on two levels, and the depiction of iron-ore mining town of Kiruna in Sweden shows the underground mine workings: kids seemed to love pressing the button that sets off an explosion. (There are buttons to press at various points to make things happen). There are football stadia and pop concerts taking place, as well as fairs and religious processions, all peopeld with thousands of 1cm high people. Oh, and the whole place regularly switches from day to night, when the twinkling of millions (literally) of LED lights gives a completely different perspective.My favourite cameo was a man chopping down a tree which then crashes through the roof of the adjacent house. The lady of the house then comes out and remonstrates with him! The control centre is also fascinating to watch (lots of screens controlling everything) in a James Bond-ish kind of way.Facilities include a cafe and large shop (of course). There are lifts between the floors, although a few sections can only be reached via stairs. You can reserve a timed entry ticket online  expect it to be very busy at weekends and in school holidays, so avoid these times if you can.There are leaflets available in English, although the buttons are in German only."
4,"This restaurant is one of the top of the range in this district. They are not only can cook, they can also present their dishes very very nice. I'm wondering how they can have so much new ideas to cook all the time, like a magic hand.Of course you have to pay a bit more with those comfortable environment, sitting and so on but it is worth."
0,"Terrible! Probably the worst T-Bone steak I've ever had. It shouldn't even be called T-Bone steak. The staff is weird as well. Avoid this place -- definitely not worth your money. Block House, Meatery and Schlachterbörse may cost a bit more, but are totally worth the money. FAIL!"
3,"The location, service, and interior of this place is really nice. The running model train within the whole restaurant adds a cool feel also and I really felt like I was back in the states! Came here for the 4th of July to get my American fix. My partner tried the spare ribs, and I had the crispy chicken sandwich. The spare ribs were awesome, my partner was in heaven. The crispy chicken was nothing special however... next time I'd just go with a regular burger as it seems red meat is more their specialty? We also tried the cheesecake here and it was pretty good, but a pretty small slice for the price. Overall, worth a visit if you need some American flavor in your life!"
4,"We were visiting Hamburg for the day and found this coffee shop / cafe on Yelp. What a find!  It reminded me of the fabulous shops in San Francisco. Great hip, minimalist decor. The coffee and food was amazing!  I had a latte that was delicious and hit the spot since we were exploring in the rain. Their breakfast menu was small but fabulous. The staff was helpful and spoke English...yay. We ordered 3 different things--waffle with fruit and mascarpone (so good), poached eggs with avocado, and scrambled eggs with a delish cheese spread for toasted bread.  Everything was fabulous!  Definitely worth a stop!"
0,"Terrible service for less than mediocre sushi. For that kind of food, it's better to do a take out from an Imbiss."
1,"The food was great..but the service was really bad..when we were ordering,the waitress was really impatient and a little rude..she was in a hurry and basically ignored the details we were telling her..we ordered a large juice and a small one was served..when we asked about it,she said that they never serve large juices (the last time we were there, i ordered the exact same thing in a large size, so it does exists..and we actually witnessed another guest ordering the large one and actually managed to get it) and we ordered chicken with pikant sauce, which then was served as a suß sauer one. When asked about the mistake, the waitress said that she didn't mess up..it is what it is..it is pikant and suß sauer (beides) and that we can't order pikant OR suß sauer, which clearly was a lie because the last time we ordered the same menu,it was pikant OR suß sauer, not AND. It had no pikant taste at all. How stupid does she think we are though..Seems like she lied to stay out of trouble. ( we ate it anyway because we did't want to create any fuss) When paying,the waiter actually asked whether i was going to give a tip or not..i honestly said no, because i was dissappointed in the service..it wasn't like we expected red carpet treatment or anything..we just wanted what we ordered (and not being lied to). After i said no, the waiter actually gave me a grunt which i found quite rude. Anyhow, i honestly think that the food was undeniably great. I can't lie about that. But it is better not to come there on busy hours, because this might happen to you as well. Communicating was a little bit hard since they didn't speak much german or english. So getting the right order might take some time. Something they clearly don't have the patience for."
3,"A very trendy place. A big plus is that they have homemade patties and you can choose what kind of bun you want. I whish that the patties tasted a bit more tho. They are in need of salt and peppar. I have only had take-away and the concept is great! You choose your type of burger, then buns and side orders and when we waited for the food we got free beverages. I have never eaten at the restauran but I would say it is worth a pop-in."
4,"Found this restaurant through Yelp. The reviews convinced us to try it and  I'm glad we did.  This very small (24-30) seat restaurant serves authentic German cuisine.  The menu was hand written in German so my wife and I couldn't read a thing.  The waiter, who spoke limited English, slowly interpreted everything on the menu for us.I had wild boar, cooked osso buco style. Served with a creamy risotto.  It was outstanding.  My wife had Weiner Schnitzel which was excellent. We had oysters and calamari for apps. 2 glasses of regional wines.  Bill was €72.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant"
3,Pretty decent bar aside all the Reeperbahn turbulences.Very friendly barkeeps which know their profession and will make sure you get the drink you want.
1,"They have a great happy hour deal: 3,50 for jumbo sized cocktails. But the food is disappointing. Not only is it grossly overpriced, but the quality doesn't even remotely justify it. We had to send back some buffalo wings that weren't cooked through. My burrito tasted like a wet sponge. My meal was bland and strange. Nothing had flavor except the salad dressing (which I regretfully discovered too late as a potential flavor enhancer). I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the Americas, from lavishly expensive to hole-in-the-wall family operations. Most all of them were splendid. Mexican food is actually very hard to screw up. But either I was mistaken and Sausalitos is not a Mexican restaurant, or like other Mexican restaurants in Germany it suffers the same curse German restaurants do in America: only still in business by virtue of their novelty. Service:People skills were sorely lacking. I got my coffee with a creamer that turned out to be empty; it had been reclosed, likely by the patron who whitened his or coffee with it earlier that day. The server was in no way apologetic or surprised by that. It also tells me something about what the restaurant does to save money when clearing tables: scavenging peoples dishes for reusable items. Disgusting!!! I won't eat there again. But I might go for cocktails (though to be honest, they weren't very good either.)"
3,"Reizendes Restaurant mit hervorragender Küche mit österreichisch-französischem Einschlag. Für ein intimes Date sind die Tische allerdings zu nah beieinander stehend, und außerdem trifft man (leider..) jedesmal auf Bekannte dort, was den lauschigen Abend ebenfalls erschweren könnte"
3,"I like the ambiente very much, never eaten there though, only nachos and it was very average. The beer is shots are nice!"
3,"Tours cost around €15 per person, which seemed a bit much at first.  The tour lasted around 90 minutes, and we took the English one (there is one English tour M-F per day and two on the weekend days).  It walked us through the process to make chocolate and offered 7 samples throughout the process from bean to wrapped chocolate which they made throughout the tour.  Our guide was awesome, and made the whole thing well worth it.  Also, we got to decorate our own bar of chocolate to take home as a souvenir."
3,"Simple place to grab an authentic and really good Italian coffee, pasta, or toasts. Friendly, popular ... and I'd go from 3.5 * to 4.0 * if they managed to clean out the cardboard, boxes, Amazon shipments and stuff on the floor next time I visit. ;)"
4,"I just like this place the beer is always cold, the music (Indie/Alternative) is always brilliant, the people around are always friendly & easy-going and the barstaff are always genuine folks. The bar itself is retro-style (orange / brown) decorated with some glamorous wallpaper :)They also got a couple of smaller rooms next to the main one equipped with loads of comfy cairs, sofas and stools. All rooms are dimly lit and so make you feel at home easily. Yet it's a smoker-friendly bar which is a disadvantage for me personally but what the heck :) As a plus you could get the chance to bump into the odd rockstar coming from Knust or Schanze. Mutter is said to be one of their fave hangouts after the show."
4,"I have had turkish food all over turkey and this place is just as good. A long line to order lunch but once I got through that, i ended up getting the chicken donner plate and it was legit. The rice had the needed texture/softness and the chicken was moist but not soggy. Outside of the kebabs I ate staring at the Galata bridge in Istanbul, this place is it. I guess come around 1PM if you want to avoid the lunch rush."
2,"Let's see I went there on a bank holiday for the all you can eat for 19,9EurI will assess the good points (+) and review  the level of improvement(-) that place needOn the + side- Price: 20euros for running sushis (all you can eat)  with a miso soup/noodle soup - Location: great around Jungfernstieg, perfect break on a shopping day or after a work out- Atmostphere: Japanese obviously, casual, sushi bar and enjoy (not just the view) of sushi constantly running in front of you.Many (German) tourists, who have no idea what eel or octopus are...right...anyway-Food: Sushi, some sashimi (otherwise resquest for it), different kind of fish, algae +++ and japanese mushroom salads++. The ingredients quality is quite remarkable...at least what's available (see  needs improvement part)- Staff: all efficient mostly friendlyOn the needs improvement side:- Food: A few items which are listed on the menu are out of order quite often (Soy beans and some fish) even on request...too badThe ratio fish/rice for sushi is 1/9, which is ridiculous, it's like a thin slice of fish with a heafty portion of rice; of course they are just trying to fill stomachs which would work just the time for you to leave the restaurant considering the high glycemic index of white rice...All  in all a good place on the go, however without the binging all you can eat, I would go elsewhere to enjoy better sliced and better fish/rice ratio sushis..."
4,"**UPDATE 13/7* Music was absolutely fantastic in here last night! They really have an awesome DJ who doesn't want to bring it down till 7am, so we just couldn't go home! Plus 1 star from me, and highly recommended free venue for the 4-7 slot before you're off to the fish market! ********I really like this place, even more now I know they serve really cheap cocktails until midnight! It looks great empty, but you'll mostly see a heaving sweaty crowd of revellers. I'm not sure there are any fire regulations in Germany as I regularly see clubs/bars with more people than would be legally allowed in the UK, but, it's all good fun. Till there's a fire."
4,"Possibly the best Irish pub I've been in outside of Ireland. As the host Aiden says, It's 60 square metres of Dublin in Hamburg. Great Guinness, great food, live music, a quiz and even live theatre  it's all done to a very high standard by friendly staff. I've had a lot of fun there and you will too. Slainté."
4,"Bock Treffpunkt Imbiss has been described to be as ""the place where vegetarians eat meat, where non-smokers smoke and where atheists come to pray.""It's that good. I ordered the köttbullar and the dish managed to exceed my already high expectations. I thought the sauteed mushrooms in the sauce was a nice touch as well. It really brought together all of the flavours. Post meal, we were offered a choice of dessert. I went with the chocolate pudding and custard. This was hands down the best köttbullar that I've had in Hamburg, yet.It's quite the interesting little setup as well -- underneath a tent. Very cozy and not the least bit cold in Winter as it is heated."
3,"There's a reason this Hamburg Chinese restaurant has such a large Chinese, Thai, Filipino clientele; it's the real deal done well.  Reasonably priced lunch specials, good portions, tasty food, and comfortable seating are the pros.  Don't let some of the surly staff or sublevel dwelling deter you.  You're bound to leave feeling you have achieved preiswert!"
3,"Having no prior knowledge of this place, therefore no preconceived ideas, I'd say it was delightful.  A nice glass of wine with an Alsacian onion tart and I was one happy gal.   A pleasant enough place with decent service and a comfortable atmosphere."
4,"I have been there a couple of time with friends visiting Hamburg. It's always been an incredible evening. Franco makes feel at home, but no only. The food is incredible. I cannot recommend enough this place."
2,"Cute little Café with lovely, little bit weirdo owners in walkable distance to the Hamburger Dom fair. They follow the ""build your own"" principle, which is nice since you get only what you like but also paying for every single item individually adds up.Generally prices are reasonable, the food is good but nothing too extraordinary, portion sizes are generous. They cakes are home made and did look delicious and juicy. Drinks come in bowls if desired, which is beautiful.Unfortunately most of the place is kinda dark because its located in the lower level."
4,Very good service and excellent foos!
4,"Good food good service good prices. I would definitely come back when in town. Not the best of areas, but if you're close to the station, it's worth a visit."
3,"Prior to my trip out to Hamburg, I thought hamburgers might have originated here!  Anyways, though that isn't the case, I am so glad I found Jim Block!  I had it bookmarked for a cheap, quick, and pleasing eat.  I came here for a very late lunch/early dinner with my boss on a Sunday afternoon.I got the Mushroom and cheeseburger meal, so it came with fries and a drink.  I decided on bottled water as opposed to soda.  The plate was huge and was about €9.  Our orders were served fast.  The burger was messy and covered with a lot of mushrooms and the cheese was perfectly melted.  They have their own signature sauce put on it and it also came with shredded lettuce.  The fries were crisp and I saw many others opted to get a baked potato or side of bread instead.  They also have the option for bunless in which you just get served the meat with toppings.  Her falafel burger was shaped into a patty and she was very pleased with it.  My meal was so big that I couldn't finish it all.  There's mostly communal seating at this very busy location.  And it's kinda cool to see how fast food is different in Europe, as they use silverware!  I would recommend Jim Block for a quick and pleasing meal.  They don't have salads but there's something for a beef eater, chicken eater and the veggie eater."
3,"Best Mai Tai in the city & panorama view on Alster lake!! Smoking area is good for talks and no load music, main venue has a long bar with friendly and sexy barkeepers."
3,"I brought a group of 9 on a Saturday with a last minute reservation for 8, which normally doesn't work because they're usually full. So I was worried, but it was surprisingly quiet that evening and we got a very nice room to ourselves with room for many more than our single tag-along guest. We were fortunate.But such popularity comes at a cost. I don't remember the prices being so high and the portion sizes so small for dishes which are relatively simple to prepare. €3.50 for a side of Bratkartoffeln. It couldn't have been more than 1 potato. (See photo)The service was excellent, as I expected it would be. Very observant waiters with a sense of humor. Although if you have a problem with your food (my friend didn't like the Pulled Pork Burger -- not enough BBQ flavor, which I agree with) they will look at you surprised and defend it and discuss it and deny it until finally they offer something to compensate. But that's typical of every Hamburg restaurant I've been to in the last 6 years. Even the foreign restaurants adopt this local attitude that nothing can ever be wrong with their food.But I have to reduce my review to 4 stars because, while the food is generally good and the service great (by German standards), they appear to be positioning themselves as something exclusive and gourmet by serving more porcelain than food and then charging an arm and a leg for it -- which would only be justifiable if the dishes were delicacies."
2,"The food was only mediocre and although the staff was friendly, it was clear most of them were inexperienced. We ordered a lot and shared the dishes:Rump steak (medium rare): this steak was undercooked (although I preferred it that way), it wasn't actually medium rare, but it was pretty good.Rib eye steak (medium rare): this steak was pretty tasteless.Caesar salad: had a weird flavor going on. Wasn't traditional caesar salad (in a bad way).Potato Wasabi Puree: interesting, but the charred avocado on top didn't do much.Grilled white asparagus: these were pretty good. Had a nice asian flavor.Marinated beefsashimi: this was mostly raw beef with a sear on the outside. There was some sort of fruit the same color as the meat, which was a surprise to bite into. This was interesting.Sashimi from loupnde mer (with grilled watermelon and san deniele ham): this wasn't so great. Didn't really work as a dish.Southern apple tuna roll (with tunasashimi, granny smith apple, avocado, basil, and soy caramel): this was pretty good. Interesting, but you couldn't really taste the apple, it might as well have been cucumber.Salmon Hand Roll: this was okay. It had a lot of mayo and not so much salmon.California Roll: decent. Nothing special.Chicken Skewer Yakitori: drenched in syrup, but the onions and chicken were okay. Wouldn't go back again, but it wasn't terrible."
3,"It's too bad that I'm not a big fan of Absinthe (it's the alcohol content and the aniseed that kill it for me), otherwise I'd probably make this place a second home. There's something mysterious and magical about the Absinth Bar, which reminds me of my teenage years, when we'd all dress up in black and run around the streets at night, hopping from bar to bar and listening to Within Temptation (I'm losing points for this, aren't I). The couple that runs this place are part of what makes this place a must-visit. The guy who served our table was extremely knowledgeable about Absinthe and it's sorts. It was obvious that this place was built around their passion for the drink and it's culture. The establishment itself is small, dimly lit and, well, green. It reminded me a bit of a bar you'd find in Narnia, after passing through the closet. I didn't have any Absinthe, but my friends did - the prices didn't seem like they'd break the bank, but they weren't entirely cheap, either. To be honest, if I would have ordered some Absinthe, I'd probably prefer to pay an extra few euros and get a quality drink. I'm following the age-old beer rule here: the cheaper the beer, the bigger the hangover. Perhaps I'll order a drink during my next visit, since it seems the folks who run the place will probably be able to suggest an Absinthe which my body won't, err, reject. I will, however, take a star off the rating for the seating arrangements in the bar. They are somewhat uncomfortable (hard wooden bench-type arrangements) and I'd like to think that a good Absinthe is at least 40% general atmosphere. Recommended to folks who'd like to try something different for a change."
4,"This restaurant is AMAZING.  Visiting Hamburg on vacation from the states and we couldn't have chosen a better spot. This restaurant was a 5 min walk from our apartment in the quaint neighborhood of St George.  Inside, the atmosphere/decor carries the charm and history of Hamburg that we were seeking in a true German experience.  We cannot sing the praises of our server, Lokman (or Baran as he is known there), enough.  He was wonderfully charming and accommodating to our ""american-ness"". He patiently lead us through the menu and engaged in entertaining, witty conversation Now for our food.  OUR FOOD.  Every bite was amazing!   Our party had everything from the ""summerly radishes soup"" to my dish, ""Our Pfundskerl"" (meatball with asparagus and noodles)   Everything was exceptional.  Each mouthwatering dish was flavorful and melted in your mouthWe cannot speak highly enough of our experience at Das Dorf"
3,"If you want yummy pierogis, vodka and a great location in north St. Pauli, this is the place to go."
1,"Fast in, fast out: this place will quell all your primary late-night urges after all those beers:* fat* carbs* saltIt will indeed do this as competently as any cheap hot-dog place in Denmark .... and that's about it.Taste-wise, nothing to write home about, particularly the flavorless mayonnaise was a turn-off for me."
4,"Finally, I am glad that provide Vietnamese coffee yay! Hard to find Vietnamese larger in Hamburg, Germany!"
4,"Monday night at 8:30 is free jazz auf dem Feuerschiff! A short and scenic walk along the harbor then, ""all aboard!"" The boat stays stationary so you don't have to worry about not wanting to stay all evening or in case you are prone to getting seasick. You are free to come and go as you please. Jazz music is played below deck where there is also a bar with some seating and a number of tables for dining as well. Fun atmosphere, good times, and good music."
4,"It's refreshing to see a kebab shop that is always packed full of people! This bustling little place is the closest I've seen to a kebab place merging with a bar. The staff are really funny, and always seem to make up a randomly lower price than the menu. When you ask for beers they fill up a carrier bag with load without enquiring as to how many you wanted! I love it. Food wise there's a massive selection of healthy stuff, including a lot of roasted veg, humous, rice, unleven bread etc. You won't get bored... ... and the killer factor? It's at the end of my road. Mr. Kebab  Dubara. Fact.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=D7Nx…"
4,"One of the better meals we had while in Hamburg.  The giant white asparagus was in season and was delicious.  Food was presented in a simple clean elegant manner, and more importantly, everyone liked their meal.  Service was attentive as well."
1,"Why does this have such great reviews?- great location (across the street of Hauptbahnhof)- people talk about this positively- hyped-----------------------------------------------------------------However I ate here I think 3 times. But always picked by my friends.Most positiv reviews came from non-asians I guess (of course I didn't check all reviews but I'm sure haha). It's like you are crazy about chinese beer, because you've never tried german beer hahahahahaha.People love Quan do because they've never tried the real good vietnamese pho.For 6,90€ or something the pho (vietnamese noodle soup) is way to small and you don't get side dishes here. And the soup is way to flavorless, not intense enought tho.YOU WANNA TRY REAL GOOD PHO? . . . GO TO VIETNAM!!! hahaha I'm joking.No there are better places in Hamburg then here. Don't waste your money.-----------------------------------------------------------------GOLDEN RULE:Always go to a pho place where you only see asians, because they know what's good.i.e. Always go to Spanish restaurants, where you only see spanish people.Always go to Indian restaurants, where you only see indians. You get the point.It's the same. You don't wanna get fake food, you wanna get the real deal. So you better start asking asians haha."
4,Perfect place for perfect ice cream. I love that it is clean and modern with outside seating. The ice cream is fantastic and the flavors include transit as well as some newer trendy flavors. Prices are fair and coffee/tea drinks are also available. I will definitely be back!
3,"Been here a few times. Cozy little place with a good selection of burgers to choose from. Love the fries too. You usually order up front at the counter. For the non german speaking folks, the lady behind the counter asks if you want ketchup or mayonnaise with your fries, and if it's a take away or not. The service is quick, and there is outdoor seating available if it's summer (and not raining)."
3,Sorry ppl forgot to take picture.. But food was deeelish! Nom nom nom.. Service was also very beautiful. Ordered Lamm w Saffron.. Not sure the name.. Lentil soup was also very good.. Get urself the Lassi's.
3,"A very good pizza. Although wouldn't be bad if they would cut the pizza or bring a pizza knife/roller. The place is nice, cool and the service is very nice and warm."
4,"Don't come here for a sit down meal, because they only have two stools in the whole place! Do come here for delicious made-to-order takeaway pizza! The basic idea is you can have a 12 for EUR3.50 + toppings for between EUR0.50 and EUR1.50. A small pizza is EUR2.50. Next time I go I'll be trying the odd-sounding, but highly recommended pineapple, jalapeno & onion pizza"
3,"Had a blissfully wonderful evening at Brüdigams.  We came for the schnitzel, and were fully satisfied.  The restaurant is small, with walls covered in cookbooks, mismatched tables, and a small bar in front of the kitchen.  You can peek through the windows and see everything going on in the kitchen.  The service was lovely, relaxed, and present.  We ordered the minestrone soup and each our own schnitzel.  We were delighted at the small taste the kitchen sent out, which was rhubarb and fresh greens meant to be taken in one bight.  The bread brought my boyfriend back to his childhood because it reminded him of the bread his mother used to buy.  It came with olive  tapenade and we tried to save it for the soup.  The presentation for the soup was very nice, the bowl came out hot, with the two raviolis and a few spring vegetables in it, then the broth was poured on from a tea pot.  The broth was very tasty, but the soup lacked vegetables and any resemblance to a minestrone soup.  The schnitzel was fabulous.  Traditional, home made and tasted so fresh.  I had roasted potatoes with mine, while my boyfriend ordered a mashed potato/rhubarb mix.  Both came with ""grandmas"" cucumber salad. We were too full for desert.They offer a menu for around 30 euros where the guest can select an appetizer, main dish and dessert.  If we had been more hungry we would have taken them up on that offer.  There is also a prix fixe menu with seasonal selections on the first page.  Something I would also like to try. Like I said, we had a wonderful experience!"
4,"Great sushi! The place is just like the main restaurant, great people, best sushi place for lunch in town. Good parking. Tasty."
4,"Einfach unglaublich köstlich, supernette Bedienung und ein urgemütliches Lokal. Volle Punktzahl!"
4,"The best pizza ever! Leave it to a little Italian joint in the Portuguese section of Hamburg to make the most mouth-watering, buttery slice of heaven. The place is tiny, crowded and noisy, but the waiters are charming and fun. When in Hamburg, you've got to try Luigi's!"
4,"I've had the Miniatur Wunderland as a bookmark for close to ten years. I made the specific trip to Hamburg to visit it today. And it was totally worth it. Absolutely incredible, it exceeded my expectations.Picture a table-top miniature train set. Now expand it to the size of a warehouse. On two floors. And add hundreds of trains, thousands of vehicles, millions of little people. Everywhere you look, there's some interesting little detail. I spotted a dozen monks working on repairing the Popemobile. A guy operating a jackhammer that would bounce around. Two people hiding on a roof that were fighting.The cars stop at lights. They even have their turn signals blinking before the light turns green and they head off on whatever mission they're programmed for.The airport? Absolutely beyond anything you can imagine. The planes take off and land. They taxi up to gates. The mini jetbridge pops out! The ground crew vehicles all follow the proper procedures for driving around the airport. They even have a fire brigade that leaves the firehouse to follow inbound trains.Tips: Get there as early as you can because it does get crowded. Make sure your phone is charged as you're going to want to take a million pictures and a ton of video. They do have a free wifi.This was one of the highlights of my week-long trip to Europe.[Review 12057 overall, 1840 of 2019.]"
4,"If you ever want to take friends out in Hamburg, make sure you visit this place first. The setting of within the gay area Talstraße with its drag-prostitutes might be a bit unusual at first but the 3-zimmer-wohnung totally makes up for it. The interior is amazing, the bar staff very friendly and the prices cheap! They have special evenings where a guy reads poems and short stories in German, which is quite entertaining and the foosball basement hosts various tounaments.Oh, and the ancient dildo collection is a must-see! Apparently they found this sealed room underneath the bar and when they broke it open, they found all these old dildos. They put them in display cabinets around the foosball tables. Go and check them out!"
4,"Highly recommended for fish lovers, never had the opportunity to try so many different fishes before"
4,"This is place is really good, delicious food, good ambiance, good prices. You have to try the crepe flambé, I want to go back soon."
4,"Amazing turkish place in the Hamburg city center...!!! Service is super fast, I really like this!! You can enjoy a huge choice of turkish food: donner, cous cous, felafel, rice, etc.Everything is so good and really cheep! Perfect if you want to enjoy a quick lunch with co-workers.Perfect for eating inside or for take-away. Please not that it could become crowded around 12."
3,Nice place for a no fuss no frills stop. Definitely a nice place to read and enjoy a cuppa. Their vanilla latte is heavenly.
3,"A very good place for a family meal for four. We came here early on a Saturday night and they were kind enough to find us a table as long we were were done by 8pm. So it's more or less Steak for four with ice-cream afterwards, you know what to expect and there are no real surprises. Nice location, well kept place."
3,"Busy little Mexican bistro but inviting to step inside! Menu options are basic but have all the necessary ingredients to get your Mexican taste buds watering. The only thing missing at a glance was fish tacos or a shrimp option. Otherwise it seemed that the more simple the better!They offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. You can order veggie, vegan, tofu, chicken, steak, beef, or even chorizo fillers/toppings along with a variety of typical sides such as rice, beans, cheeses & several sauces. There is a sign that states: If we do not serve you within 10min, you'll be served in 15-20min, we are doing the BEST we can!!! Fair enough, but even with such a warning, the smells and your hunger wear down your patience as you sit feeling famished and eager to eat! The service is so friendly one does not complain, but when your food finally comes to the table, you dig right in!!! The portions are huge and the burritos are fresh & tasty :-) It reminds me of a German version of the U.S chain, Chipotle but without seeming sooo franchisey (I made up that word just now) Order a side of sour cream & salsa then enjoy!!!"
4,"Amazing food, great service, one of the best low-key restaurants I have been to in a long time. The menu changes daily based on what fish is fresh that day. All the food is melt-in-your-mouth good  - amazing seafood and an incredible parmesan pasta dish with truffles. Very nice, but not too fancy. Pretty much a perfect dining experience!"
4,"Good reviews, although surrounded by soulless chain options down in the belly of the former state bank's mall: obviously had to try this!A very friendly greeting, and you sense immediately that this is an authentic, handmade place. Competitive prices: a mix of 3 different tacos plus a drink (do go for the sugar free homemade lemonade) will be 10€, the daily lunch option just 7€ with drink. But you will also want the freshly made (fresh as in: they make it right in front of you) guacamole.The tacos are excellent - not sophisticated excellent, but Mexico taco stall excellent. The lemonade tastes like the model every lemonade everywhere should taste like. And the guacamole, well, could just be more of it!The location in a food court is as pedestrian as they come, but if you sit inside, with the back to the court, it actually feels like the hand built taco stall it is, with colorful chairs, great music, and thick stone bowls for that guacamole.Please also add some Baja-style fish taco to your menu!!Will absolutely be back, don't go away."
2,"I had been craving Mexican food since moving to Hamburg and this seemed to be one of the better local places from Yelp reviews, so I decided to give it a try this evening.I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender was friendly. I decided to order a beef burrito based on ""burrito"" being in the title of this place; although, people sitting next to me ordered quesadillas which looked great, and there are also enchiladas. There are very above average vegetarian options, including spinach, mushrooms, nopal, tofu, and seitan for burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.The burrito wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great. I liked the texture of the tortilla (pressed on the grill), but the fillings weren't particularly good tasting. I also thought the burrito was lacking flavor and could have used more ingredients (some salsa, sour cream, and guacamole like the quesadillas included certainly would've been nice). The steak, rice, and beans weren't bad but didn't taste particularly good. There were also diced tomatoes and onions that were fine.Overall, I would go here if you're in the mood for Mexican food and in the area because it's not bad, but I can't recommend this place for having a particularly good burrito."
3,"It's ""Australian"", but to be honest I've never noticed any antipodeans here. You can get average Australian beer if you like, but I recommend sticking with the German stuff. I've always wondered whether they'd show Australian sport on tv, somehow I doubt it (I've never really noticed any TVs), but maybe they do. Actually, randomly, the best thing about down under are their chicken wings. Plentiful, relatively cheap and with a myriad of sauces. They also do some decent burgers, but weirdly they come on toasted baguettes rather than buns."
4,"This is a must go to place!! Just make sure you go there very hungry. 5 star service, great people that truly enjoy their job. I find this rare in Germany. The food is just amazing. I havent tried too many dishes but the ones I have are, like I said, amazing!I recommend you get the 52 mit Pommes. It is a lot of food. My wife had the calamari which I tried and they were just perfect.Check this place out!!!"
4,Heaven for runners. Follow this route if you live in Eppendorf. joggingroutes.org/2012/1…
1,"Would love to give them a higher rating but the carrot quiche that we had was TERRIBLE. I have no doubt that because we were the Americans we were subjected to what we were told was ""the last of the quiche"" and ""the only quiche available"" was the carrot quiche. The gentleman ahead of us had ham and the 4 people that came in after us also were given the option of ham, of course they took ham. Awful, awful, awful"
4,Just moved to the good and I have to say this is very decent Thai food.Other than the other Asian restaurants that claim to be Thai this actually has proper Thai food. Pad Thai is on point. They have a few delicious but very different dishes instead of 150 items that all taste the same. No bs and great flavor. Stay local and support your hood!
4,Tasty Food. Quick Service. Was Three dir Lunch. Menu was a bit hard to read from far away written on the board. But waiter helped us choose the right dish for us.
4,"Great location, tasty and cheap burgers, long queues, not enough seats. But there is always an option to get food takeaway and sit next to Alster!"
3,"We went to Witwenball for a special occasion dinner when some friends visited from out of town. Overall, the space is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is good. I think my only real complaint is that the pacing of the meal was extremely slow (for my taste)."
2,We went there as a small group. The place has a nice decor. They serve typical German food. The food is good but I didn't find it great. May be it was not their night. I need to be back there once more.
3,"You can't get cheaper than free, and so it's hard to be anything less than happy with a visit to the Botanic Gardens in Planten und Blomen. It's great on a cold winter's day because everything is so nice and tropical in there - the heating costs must be enormous! However, unless you're massively into plants, then it's not that interesting. My favourite bits were the insect-eating plants, and the cactus room."
4,"This was my go-to coffee spot in Hamburg. Missing it to this day.Great location, really nice staff and the coffee is just amazing. I still dream of the perfect double-shot Americanos I got from here.This plus a few other places alone would make Hamburg worth a trip."
3,A staple Döner spot in the Jarrestadt. They are very quick and efficient in preparing the Döner and friendly enough. We've tried the falafel durüm and the Döner wrap and both liked it. Just wish the spicy sauce would be a bit more spicy! Prices are also good and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated with outdoor seating.
3,Öld style Environment with well built antique! Little bit expensive but quality ! Bre
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Sagner's, and tried the northern German specialty labskaus.  The restaurants was a short walk from my hotel, and also was totally local. Luckily they had English menus, and the hostess was quite helpful and could speak English. I also sipped on a tasty local beer. Well priced also."
4,"one of the best icecream you can get in Hamburg. very tasteful, Not to sweet, not full of cream as in most stores. no fancy shit just pure taste."
4,"Brilliant chinese restaurant and easily the best I've been to in Hamburg. Golden seem to concentrate more on traditional Chinese dishes instead of the carbon-copy stuff we're all used to seeing on the menu in other Chinese establishments. So, what's on the menu? Well, what isn't? Asparagus in chopped scampi, cold glass-noodle salad, green onion soup, various rice, noodle, beef, fish and chicken dishes, Golden really has it all, and most of it will be very new to you - so try it out! Very highly recommended!"
3,"Good food, and the wines were priced  faily compared to retail prices (the bottles we bough at, €49 and €99, were about 2xstore prices).The young waiter from Sardinia was very attentive and coped completely with strange Danish humor;)"
1,"Overrated Italian restaurant, expensive, laud and busy. My chair was in the middle of the corridor and every time the waiters were hitting on me. The risotto was quite a strange one, couldn't finished it. And the pasta of the day looked like the pasta of last week. Not al dente but overcooked, without personality and taste I was expecting in a family Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Not a place to come back."
4,Loved this place. Was so cute inside and the tapas were awesome! Def coming back again maybe during the happy hour when the food is discounted. Can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommend.
3,Cool and stylish with prices to match. Always a relaxed atmosphere - a decent place to catch up with friends.
0,"The food was good - the service appalling. The server made extremely intrusive and inappropriate comments to my face about my breasts and figure, several times, invited another waiting customer to comment on them, and then called over another worker to share in this frankly appalling objectification of a paying customer and human being. Would never recommend this establishment to any woman who doesn't want to risk being hit on and objectified, and trapped in an extremely uncomfortable situation while your food is in the process of being made Overall - disgusting treatment of female customers, left me feeling revolted and uncomfortable."
2,"A very good restaurant! Wee bit posh, but I liked it.However within Hamburg competition it's not outstanding.Location: Perfect. The place is located in great place and also inside it's clean, posh and kind of romantic. I liked the music on this Friday evening very much.Food and Drinks: Wine list is average. Nothing really special. Wine quality is very good.Food was my biggest disappointment. The Beef tartar was done in a very unique way. There was a bottom layer of a spicy sauce. Not my style, as it was not possible to taste the tartar itself. Fish for main dish was excellent. However the side dishes (KartoffelSCHAUM) was just marketing. Simply potatoes were served.Service: There is room to improve. Especially with the white wine and how to pour which wine in a glass. I've to admit the young ""main waitress"" was perky in a positive "" Hamburger Deern"" way.  Overall: If you around it's a place to visit and enjoy dinner."
1,"Basic, average food for premium price. I ordered the seafood plate- it turned out to be boiled seafood with a watery sauce and a handful of sliced veggies no side dish, even though it costs 16€. I wouldn't recommend this place."
3,I had the vegan pancakes called Roxen. It was served with fruits and apple puree. The portion was really huge. Next to that I ordered a lactose free cappuccino with oat milk. I was only able to eat one of the twopancakes. The pancakes could be a little bit sweeter. The atmosphere is cozy and hip. The service was good and friendly.
4,"Looking for organic food in Hamburg, Google found this for us. It is truly a little paradise. Our host Peter Kühn took great care of Colleen and me!"
4,"This place is AMAZING! I lived in Hamburg for 3 months, and loved this place. The Durum Doner they make is made fresh all day. Juicy meat and amazing Tortilla like bread..... You will not regret going here, trust me!!"
4,This place had bags of potential when it first opened  but now it is absolutely spot on. Friendly people and great waffles and icecream!
4,It doesn't look like much from the outside but it is a friendly comfortable place for a drink and cake. Every time I've been there it has been full and the pastries are great!
4,"We stumbled onto this wonderful place when visiting Hamburg in 2011.  We were treated with a hip interior, tasty treats, and friendly staff. Owner's attention to details is not only on the food, but shows through each reclaimed materials and objects throughout this depot. Definitely was a highlight of our visit!"
3,"Service was ok  butt the food had great taste and culture its always packedBlond waiter who wiped our table with his hand and told us ""thats how it is in here""Youre awesome keep it like that"
4,"Astra Stube is one cool little bar! It's basically a tiny little gig venue located under the S-Bahn tracks in the north-west of the schanze. It's a bit out of the way, but if you're into your local independent rock and indie music, then you'll definitely want to put this on you list of must-visit places. The only real drawback is that the place is just too small, so it gets very sweaty very fast. Oh well, you can't have everything :)Since writing the above review two years ago a few things have happened. 1) The bar was going to be closed (along with many nearby businesses) due to work on the above railway bridge2) There was a large outcry; notably the Jan Delay album ""Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Soul"" features a photo of the bar as it's front cover; The work was put back a few years3) The popular Hamburg-based film ""Soul Kitchen"" featured a scene in the bar, somehow managing to make the bar look something other than tiny."
4,"What a great little cafe. Just stumbled upon it today with an acquaintance who recommended we stop in for an espresso. We ended up having a piece of homemade cake and this was fantastic. The majority of things sold here homemade and everything looks spectacular. The primary goal of the place is to sell tidewood but I think they do more business as a cafe. If you can find it, definately make sure to stop in. Although we had very little to do with the service personnel, it seems like everyone there was really nice. People were also hanging out there during the middle of the day, in a workweek. Seems like an awesome place to stop in for a coffee and just enjoy time passing by."
3,"This restaurant was a short walk from our hotel, so we stopped in for dinner.  The place was crowded, but we were seated upstairs right away.  We were also very happy that both the hostess and waiter spoke English exceedingly well.I got the schweinshaxe (roast pork knuckle) and my friend got a fish dish.  The potato dumpling served with the pork was probably the best I'd had in Germany, but the pork at the Schneider (Weisses) Brauhaus was much better.Prices were reasonable, the establishment is roomy, and we sat at a table for two (which is rare in some places).  Overall, a good dining experience."
3,I had some of the best Calamari here that I have ever had.  The cocktails looked big and good. (A friend with me had a few of those).  I had two very large servings of that Bitte Hefe weissen which I really enjoyed.  The service was friendly and good.  They have a big board with the menu on it in German.  They will tell you what it is in English though if your German is not that good like mine. :)
0,"Barca is a shame for the leisure and tourism industry in Hamburg!On a sunny day in September we decided to take a pedalo boat trip in the evening and called Barca. Unfortunately they only have one mobile phone and no one picks up the phone. I tried it several times during 3 hours and I wrote an email. We needed to go to Barca without any information as the website does not provide a lot of general info on the pedalos. This left us unsatisfied at the counter at 7 p.m., because a boat rental was not possible anymore. They told us it is to late as sunset is in an hour and they frankly speaking do never pick up the phone. The pedalos looked nice and the landing stage was packed with people chatting and enjoying the fresh breeze.In the end this is the worst customer service I have expected in years. No one ever picked up the phone, nobody responded to my mail so far and the website does not provide basic information on the rental times."
4,Great Location when the weather is Bad! :)You should come early in the morning or 2 hours befor they close the exebition! Otherwise it will be maybe overcrowded
3,"It's always nice to chase away the daily routine at Café du Passage in Winterhude. It's like a little hideout with its friendly staff and the nice food & bev. You can get anything from breakfast over quiche to cakes and it's all yummy, promised.As a plus there's a vast selection of tea available, too.Prices are fine and so is the interior. It's just set up with heart and soul. You can nearly feel it.It's just lovely to sit (inside or outside) there and goggle at the passersby. Alternatively you can read magazines and books if you feel like wanting a quiet time to yourself.Once you were lucky enough to find this little jewel I bet you will keep coming back again and again and again and again"
1,"Update: I'm going to have to mark Jim Burritos down a bit because they keep on disappointing. The food is generally still pretty good, although my last burrito was burnt from being left in the toaster far too long. I feel bad saying bad things about the place, but I think one member of staff in particular is rather dozy. She seems to have no idea who ordered what first. If she's on, you can walk in and order your food and then watch as streams of people who came in much later get their food first. Then when your food finally arrives (I have waited 90 minutes) you could very well be given the wrong order. I took two friends last week. We were the only people without food when we ordered, so I expected the three burritos to come quite fast, say in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, after watching plenty of other tables receive their food, we finally got ours. Mine was burnt. My friend was given a spicy one, when she'd ordered non-spicy. After a small complaint she was offered some extra sour cream. Instead of bringing it over, the staff went outside for a cigarette break. The sour cream never came and when we went to pay they had the nerve to overcharge us! Sigh. I still like Jim Burritos, and will continue to go, but I won't take visitors anymore, and I certainly will never go back on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday - they are just too slow.Old review: Pretty damn good burrito shop where the old Hatari cantina used to reside. We popped into Jim Burrito's last night - you've gotta try the new places, right? I got a beef burrito with guacamole for EUR6.50 (EUR5.50 without the guacamole). Their burritos come wrapped in tin foil, and so can be a bit of a pain to eat - I'd rather be given the option to have it straight onto a plate without all the foil. Anyway, the burrito was great."
3,"Had a day in Hamburg and a friend brought us here.  Did not like it that I had to give up my bottled water at the door... did they think I'l not order a drink and just sip my water in there?! Once in, the place was great. Feel like I was on a sandy beach bar somewhere else in the world.   Then the rain come down like crazy & everyone squeezed into the covered bar area...dancing to the music.  So much fun, very memorable!  Highly recommend it !"
2,"My UK colleague and I were seeking a late night seafood dinner around 10pm.  A woman in her late 20s recommended this Portuguese seafood restaurant, Gaststätte La Sepia in Sternschanze.  As we were in the city center, we took the S-Bahn to the Sternschanze and walked 5 mins to the restaurant.  The restaurant was relatively emply, so we were seated immediately.  I ordered a mixed grill fish platter, which included five types of fish, served with tartar sauce.  It was delicious and tasted fresh.  Some other reviews reported cockroaches in the fridge containing the fresh fish and being served moldy lemons with their fish. I wouldn't have visited the restaurant if I had read these reviews beforehand, but having been there, I can report the food was delicious, although I can't vouch for the hygiene!"
2,"It was interesting to see an Asian buffet concept come to life in Hamburg.  In addition to a wide assortment of prepared foods at the buffet table, there is also station for ""live"" cooking where they will cook your assortment of fish, meats, and vegetables for you.  The buffet itself is mixed.  The sushi was pretty weak, with very thin slices of fish, but the quality seemed decent.  Chinese fare did better with the fried shrimp and stir fries being pretty good.  The hot and sour soup was also surprisingly good, and surprisingly spicy.  The grill portion is what you make of it.  The quality of the ingredients was good, and they do a simple stir fry with olive oil, so it's closer to a Japanese style teppan rather than a Mongolian grill.  Dessert selections were limited and spread out and included a few types of cakes, glazed bananas. and some fried sesame balls.Overall, Copperhouse is a decent Asian buffet in a nice setting.  With unlimited visits to the buffet and ""live"" cooking table, it is a good value especially for those with an appetite."
2,"The 20 UP is located in a Hotel in the St Pauli district. It is of course known for its breathtaking views of the city. However that is about it. The service is horrible, the drinks are watered down, and it is rather small. And because it has become even more popular with tourist so it is filled to the brim with them.In my opinion, go there once, keep your coat on, walk over to the window, take a few pictures and enjoy the view and then get the hell out of there. You'll thank me later."
4,"Best Indian food I've had in Hamburg thus far. Went here on an impulse with coworkers for lunch. Little hole in the wall place with amazing food at incredibly low prices. We shared an appetizer of veggie samosas. Love the way it was plated with a variety of dips at all degrees of heat from none to more than some. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Thali, it contained a moderate hint of heat which was enjoyable. My dish came with chicken, rice, yoghurt, a mini salad, bean/legume side, and naan. It was hard to believe all this was just €5.50. After seeing my coworker's plate of Chili Chicken Thali, I think I will have to try that next time to test just how spicy it might be."
3,"On a spur, we checked out this restaurant near the Altona Sbahn. I'm a vegetarian and was super pleased with the options. The food was quite tasty and the service was good too. I enjoyed it!"
2,"I've had lunch here a few times and to be honest it is not my cup of tea. It is a cool place to have lunch, considering you are eating inside the Rathaus. The food is not horrible but it wasn't memorable in a good way either. I had the Currywurst last time and the sauce was horrible. The texture was like sand, it was bitter, not spicy in least, and plain just tasted bad. The fries were also a bit bland which is surprising since they are fries. I mean how hard is it to screw up fries? The other times I have been here it was for a ""party"". They cleared out the entire place and changed it into a club. They always seemed to have great DJs at those events as well. The price is not the cheapest by any means so bring your money and lots of it."
4,"Awesome German food! A few nice Schnitzels to choose from (incl. a beer crust and a pretzel-breaded Schnitzel), as well as other pasta and meat specialties. Nice high-class brewery atmosphere  speaking of which, their beer is excellent. Fair prices as well, and a very central location. Friendly waitstaff. One of my favorite German food places in Hamburg!"
3,"Very nice experience!  The food was surprisingly fresh tasting for a chain.  The salad was good, I highly recommend when getting a sandwich or a soup (as I did) adding the salad for and extra euro.  Everything can be taken to go!  Something I have noticed becoming the ""new trend"" in gastronomy in Hamburg.  I can remember when even coffee was never served in a togo cup!Dean & David was great! Nice location and decor.  Free Wifi if you are looking for a nice place to get some work done!Check it out!"
4,"Believe it or not, this is the best place for university students and everyone else alike.  I bring up university because you remember how tough it was back in school to eat healthy, a good size portion, and for a good price, right?!  I rate this levels above Campus Suite for quality, because most people from school do not know about this lunch spot and end up eating at Campus Suite if they go off campus away from the Mensa (cafeteria food at school).Well this place solves all that and does it in good timing to boot! This spot is totally worthy of a five star rating!  Every type of person comes here and enjoys returning because they have a great lunch special.  Usually it is some fish or pasta of the day and it tastes so good and costs 6€ was what I paid for a tagliatelle fresh pasta with creamy tomato sauce, grilled wild salmon with herbs, and freshly grated parmesan cheese with cracked pepper to add the final touches.   If you do not have to be at work or at school within the hour, once can also stop in here and have a glass of wine.  Most of the space is standing limited, but if you can get a window seat at the bar, its nice to watch everyone walk by on the Colonnaden above. since the restaurant is located below ground level. Specialty meals can change depending on what fish or pasta they have on hand during different times, which is a nice reason to return here regularly."
2,"Interior looks nice, bartender were nice, atmosphere was nice, all went well but you can smoke inside. We gave it a try anyway, but just this one time."
2,"It's ok (for a Vietnamese). Good selection, nice ambience and a place you can take your friends to for Vietnamese food. The food is average I would say but value isn't that great. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in town."
4,"This is a fantastic beautiful park based near the centre of Hamburg, Lazy sunny afternoons lounging around with friends, playing frisbee, lovely walks this is the place to be. There is a good childrens play area, and a paddling pool. Theres a large pond where you can sail remote control boats etc. There are lots of trees and pathways and you can see the planetarium from the edge of the park. Really nice place to relax."
3,As a british man Indian curries are extremely important to us as they are our nation's favourite.  The service was polite and authentic as was the choice of two Indian beers. My wife chose a wine and it was very nice which is rare in a curry house and we shared the 2 person tandoori platter. It was a lot of food but very very nice.
4,"Can't believe I am the first one to write a review on this world-class museum! International Maritime Museum in Hamburg has information on absolutely everything related to maritime history of the world: from Vikings to Jacques-Yves Cousteau. The museum was opened in summer 2008 as a home to the biggest in the world private maritime collection. And believe me, this collection is enormous: 10 storeys filled with boat models, sea maps, navy uniforms, weapons, mini boat models and much much more. In fact it is so overwhelming, that I could hardly manage the last storey. Information provided on English as well, there are a lot of 'interaction points' so that you don't get bored. The entry is not cheap but it's so worth it. In two words: highly recommended!"
3,"My friend and I had a lovely lunch here today after spending about two hours enjoying the Miniatur Wunderland not far away.Good service (what? yes!) from an attentive waitress who helped with our orders, brought us beer and food and was amazingly swift with the check. She was even able to split it across two credit cards. Yes!I've been craving currywurst for some reason and so that's what I had for lunch. A nice sized sausage with a spicy sauce and a big serving of fries. It perfectly satisfied my craving. And the delicious lager with it? Ja!Free wifi worked well as we tried to work out what we'd do next in this city.[Review 12056 overall, 1839 of 2019.]"
4,"By far the best Irish Pub I've visited in Germany so far. The owner is from Dublin, half of the staff is also Irish native. Great pint of Guinness (or as they'd call it ""Perfect Pint""), great atmosphere. Make sure to try the burgers and baguettes, order Guinness and best drop in on a Thursday for the weekly pub quiz (not during the summer) or on a Friday / Saturday for the craic. Also worth mentioning: probably the largest collection of Irish whiskeys I've seen in a pub so far. However, no other than Irish whiskey is served."
4,"What an amazing experience, it was made more interesting due to the language barrier for me. Friendly staff and the menu kept me guessing. Once the friendly guide knew I was Australian he made an extra effort to translate most things for me which I really appreciated. I booked online from Australia and the customer service was top notch. All my questions and queries were answered promptly. I went by myself and wouldn't recommend it unless you can speak German as unless you are lucky like I was tonight you will struggle knowing what's happening."
4,"Ah, vegetarian friends. Who'd have them? Not me for one! But on occasion I do have few visiting couchsurfers with an aversion to meat. For these moments, Azietona is a little gem, which is fortuitously located next to sofabar!"
0,"YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT! What you get is 2 sweet girls who understand customer service and one male manager who does not!1. What we ordered 4 cheeseburgers and 6 orders of chicken wings2. What we got 4 cheeseburgers on english muffin buns? 6 chicken wings?!French fries made with old stale oil.  ketchup, mayo----oops no napkins?3. A manager telling me HOW IT IS - mam your order is wrong because you ordered wrong!! hmmm I rememebr in 7th grade business class 101 ""The customer is always right"" NOT HERE-THE BIRDFu*kUVERYMUCH for your service"
3,"I have been to Hamburg so many times that I thought I knew the city.Apparently, I can't be further away from being wrong. This museum - that is located on beautiful park with idyllic lake teaches you all about Hamburg and its history. It's located not far from U-bahn stop St. Pauli, so it can't get any easier than that, not to mention it's not far should you be interested to check out all the ""interesting"" entertainment on the infamous Reeperbahn.Again, dragged by my history and museum geek boyfriend, I came here by force (if not by free will) although I wasn't literally kicking and screaming. If it were up to me, I'd rather spend my time at Monckebergstrasse, but oh well - I guess a little history won't hurt.This museum has very interesting models of pretty much everything in Hamburg. At least you won't be bored by history by looking at interesting teeny weeny intricate models. It taught you what Hamburg really was back then when some Christian missionaries (and bishops) chose to settle here and named the town Hammaburg. It's almost like reading it on wikipedia, but with a lot of cute models. See? not boring.The layout of the museum was cool too and they had a room full of model ships just like in Copenhagen's Orlogsmuseet, and the most cool about this museum is that on the top floor, they have a working railway model of Hamburg in the scale of 1:32. That was amazing to watch. They did have people operating the trains and all. I felt like I went back to my childhood again.On the basement floor they had small exhibition of what Hamburg was like under Nazi reign, along with recreation of shops, places under World War II. Very interesting.All in all, a very interesting place to visit, especially if you're interested about history....and oh, did you know that Reeperbahn literally means the rope way? It's where back in the yore they made ropes for the ships. See? More knowledge of history here! I'm getting like 1% smarter than before... :P"
3,"Don't know why Oma decided to name this place Apotheke, when it is in fact a bar / restaurant, but however bad his marketing skills are there is no doubt he cook some banging food. I played it safe with a tasty French Onion soup inside a bowl made of bread (only ever seen this done previously in Austria), which was gorgeous and more than enough for a meal in its own right. Bargain for the 5EUR it cost me. My fellow dinner guests followed suit, except for one brave soul who plumped for the cheeseburger, which was so big it could have given Chunk (thebestsportsblog.com/im…) a run for his money."
3,"Super location across from Abaton Kino in the University quarter of Hamburg, this Turkish restaurant is a favorite of students and movie enthusiasts. I have enjoyed lunches and dinners here for close to ten years and throughout that time quality and service have varied but during the FilmFest Hamburg, both were exceptional. A big bonus is the non-smoking section in the front of the restaurant, actually away from all the smokers. My spinach and feta wrapped in phyllo dough served with a green salad was hot, fresh and mouthwateringly delicious. Not only that, but when I flashed my press pass and said I was in a hurry, I had the best fast food ever. Many appetizers are enough for a good value meal, but as with most places, prices have gone up so it is not the bargain it used to be, particularly when it comes to drinks. The atmosphere depends on the customers as the place itself is unremarkable and at garden level (meaning limited daylight) but outside tables on a sunny day can be quite the treat. Open seven days a week from 9:00am until 3:00am with breakfast and special lunch menu."
3,"Nice cafe with a chilled vibe. Good coffee and good cake too. Unfortunately, one star deducted for my chocolate cake being on the dry side. May have been sitting out just a bit too long. Yet the mascarpone and cherry cake was great. We sat at the table right on the front window. Best spot in the cafe. I won't deduct a star as they were nice but it took forever to get out coffees which came way after we had the cake on the table. It was kind of full but I found it to have still taken quite long. Will be back and maybe next time it will be better."
0,"The food is really average, had a quinoa bowl, just a lot of over cooked quinoa with nothing in it, it came with vegetables with poor quality and no flavor... a sad boring vegan restaurant, vegan food is so much more than that !!"
2,"There certainly is a new wave of ice cream in Germany ... but I wondered why people keep lining up at Eisliebe? Is it that it's 20-30 cents cheaper than at Schmidt's up the road?Eisliebe's few flavours from Amarena to Vanilla are as vanilla as they come, and so is the quality. I actually threw away some of it, it was so bland."
4,"Visiting from New York, it's not always easy to find great espresso bars in Hamburg. This is an excellent one."
3,"This is a great place in Hamburg to sit and eat with friends. It's pretty packed, but if you hang around it long enough, you can get a place to sit.  I'd say this place is more north Vietnamese than southern, which means the dishes are presented and named differently, but it's so slight most people won't even notice/care. The pho here is different than most other Vietnamese restaurants: you don't get a side dish of bean sprouts, lime, chilis and herbs to add to you soup.This isn't a downside in my opinion, because the soup gets there fast and is beautifully satisfying.Since all the pho is 6.50 (a freaking steal if you ask me), I got pho tôm, which was pretty damn good. My friends all had Bún (pork, beef & tofu). I tried the tofu bún and it was truly amazing. I will probably get it the next time I'm here. The drinks were all good, both the lemonades and the red sake mojito are freshly made.All in all (tl;dr), it's a nice casual place to go and sit with friends and eat, drink & talk. I'm sure it's even nicer in the summer months with outdoor seating and slower tempo. The only downside was the waitress, she was a bit curt and heavy-handed, but I'm sure she'd had a long day. In the end we didn't mind it because the food was good and the service was fast."
4,Found the Bistro as I was walking around and I am so glad I stopped in as the service was fabulous!! I had the Hambourgeouise tartine and it was amazing!!!
2,"Soup (mizo) and sushi were OK, but I wouldn't necessarily come back for them.Service was sparse, staff was friendly but not paying much attention. Asked for extra rice but never got it."
0,Food and drinks are small and we encountered the RUDEST waitress on the planet. Don't waste your time or money
4,"Great donër! Unfortunately, it seems that everyone else in Hamburg agrees. Around lunch time, expect to have a half hour wait. We saw that one day and went somewhere else; came back to Kardelen at 2:00pm the next day and got food in under five minutes."
3,"Copperhouse isn't bad, actually it's quite good. I really loved their lamb and halibut. This is an Asian food buffet/ teppanyaki style restaurant. It's 25 euros for all you can eat, so it's more of a come while you're starving kind of place. Most of the dishes are pretty mediocre, but the lamb and fish were delicious. Hence four stars instead of three. Some of the dishes included stir fry fried noodles, fried duck, egg rolls, fresh fruit, and fried bananas. I also had a strawberry colada which was pretty decent as well. There are some things that need improvement such as their not so good sauces and cold chocolate cake (honestly a chocolate mousse from the local supermarket would be much better than this).  Also, the sushi could use some love. I'm not sure if I would come back on my own, but if someone else suggested it I would probably come along. Oh, it's also located right on the Reeperbahn, so it's a good place to get loaded up on food before your drinking night out."
3,"Best flammkuchen in town, but also pizza is very good  try the Diavolo  and it almost never looks twice the same, that's kind of funny. It's quite small so sometimes during lunch it's quite packed. Tip: if the old lady offers you cookies or sweets when you're about to pay don't refuse: she can get a bit upset and give you a angry look :)"
2,"Das neue Innen-Design ist cool und modern, ähnelt stark Starbucks. Leider gibt es hier nicht mehr die hintere Sitzecke, in der man sich etwas zurückgezogener unterhalten konnte. Sehr schön finde ich immer die Blumen-Arrangements auf den Tischen! Der Lärmpegel ist wie eh und jeh sehr laut.  Die verschiedenen Kaffee-Spezialitäten (Caramellj, Vanilla Latte etc.) schmecken für mich alle gleich, dafür sind die Baguettes und Surf-Cup-Nudeln sehr lecker!  Für einen kleinen Zwischenstopp zum Füße ausruhen eine gute Wahl mitten in der City."
4,"Love the ambience, nice n clean for local fine dining! Great food n wonderful service!"
2,"Once upon a time their burgers and sweet potato fries were amazing. Now they serve you ketchup in a tiny paper cup, you drink your lemonade from an IKEA glass (used to be jars) and their sweet potato fries don't taste as good anymore. Burgers itself are good for the price offered on the lunch menu. Staff seems to change frequently, though they are always friendly."
3,"My wife and I haven't eaten at too many Italian restaurants in Hamburg since we first moved here, but enough to feel like pizza here just isn't very good. It seemed like most restaurants liked to reheat some version of a frozen pizza or just some other variety that just didn't taste authentic, or really very good for that matter.We were beginning to lose hope, thinking that we had to travel to Italy constantly to get good pizza (which obviously isn't a bad thing at all, especially since plane tickets aren't too bad from here). For the times we don't feel like leaving Hamburg but really want pizza, Grazie a Dio for Luigi's! It's the best tasting pizza we've tried, and the most authentic thus far in Hamburg.  All of the pizzas are very good (especially the pizza parma) and cooked in a large indoor wood-fired oven! I love that! Lunch menu portions, which are served around 12pm to 3pm Mon. - Fri. are just the right size per person at an awesome deal of 5€ per person with a small drink. Off-weekday-lunch hours the pizzas are almost double the price, but also probably 1.5 times the size...so there's that. My wife and I actually struggled to finish two pizzas on a lovely summer afternoon in Hamburg and had to box about a half of a pizza to take home. We will continue to try new pizza places throughout our new home, but we're glad to know that we have a really good place to come back to again and again."
4,"At first you may be overwhelmed by the fullness of the restaurant but it is extremely simple to order, just choose a dish and it will normally already come with extras like rice and naan. DELICIOUS!!"
2,"This used to be a five star place. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have taken a dive. Service is fast and it's so busy you have to fight for a seat. This hasn't changed. These are the reasons I'm disappointed: 1.) My favorite items, the salad and the sandwhich with thinly sliced filet has been discontinued. Only variations of burger patty are available now. 2.) They ran out of carbonation for their fountain drinks. They offered a bottle of Fritz Cola instead, but didn't have any in diet. 3.) I ordered a salad with balsamic vinegar and got one with French dressing. 4.) They remade my salad and it tasted like both balsamic and French dressing combined. Was the mixing bowl clean? 5.) It used to be that their salads used the finer parts of the leaves. My salad tonight consisted of at least 50% white parts, the tough and tasteless sections of the lettuce leaf near the stem. I ended up eating less than half of my salad. Even my husband who happily gobbles up my plate and his took just a few bites and gave up. Honestly, with the filet strips no longer on the menu, I have no reason to return to this Jim Block or any other Jim Block."
1,"This place was quite an unpleasant surprise. Although we had passed by it often, living quite nearby, we hadn't tried it out. On a sunny day, we saw seats outside and decided to try it out for lunch. We had some wine, a pizza and noodles with gorgonzola and bacon. First and foremost, the prices here are a joke. I live in the area so I know it's not cheap around here. At the same time, the prices here are higher than everywhere around and the portions are smaller. The pizza is a decent size but they forgot one of the ingredients. Further, it was thin-crust but mushy and wet. Nothing crunchy or appealing about this dish. The noodles were bland and I think I counted about 15 pieces (in total) of penne. This as a main course and for something like 12 Euros. The pizza for somewhere in the vicinity of 15 Euro for the ""large"" was ridiculous. The wine, also not cheap, was OK but nothing more. Finally, service was a joke. Slow is an understatement. Disinterested and unprofessional fits the bill.So, why two stars? Well, I really like the decor inside. It is well styled. Further, it's a nice location and if you are only coming in for a couple glasses of wine, fine. I'll give them two stars for deco and location. Otherwise, everything else is a joke.Finally, you better like snobs. The place is usually full of your usual Eppendorfer clowns. Pinks, greens, animal prints, silicon lips, LV bags and so forth. I can usually drown them out and mostly find them amusing decoration for a place. They entertain me well but I know enough people who would gag at their sight and here you don't have to wait long for the ""show"" to begin."
2,"Very disappointed. If you want to go for a brunch in Pauline at weekend, reservation is definitely necessary. The reservation list has always been long and it is recommended to reserve at least 4 days ahead. I've been looking forward to try their food because it seems so popular. However, you only get a 3-star hotel kind of breakfast for their 18.7€ buffet brunch menu. Totally a ruin of appetite and absolutely too expensive for such quality of food. The only good part of it is that at least you can make a nice Instagram style picture."
2,"Probably over priced, for what you get, but I guess that's how they make money. We did the all you can eat dinner. It's not like typical all you can eat buffet places. You order off of an Ipad. You can order up to 10 items (for the both of us) every 10 minutes for 10 rounds. They have both sushi and ""hot plates."" The portions are small, but there were tasty options. The edamame was served cold though. Like, just taken out of the refrigerator, cold, not even room temperature. Maybe that's normal in Germany or for this place, but I found it displeasing. The sushi rolls you order come with 2 pieces (so 2 pieces is 1 item out of your 10). The salmon nigiri was very good. There were large slices of salmon over the rice, and it tasted very fresh. The sushi rolls were good as well. But keep in mind for every piece you do not eat, they will charge you extra. By the end we were forcing ourselves to finish a few sushi rolls so we didn't have to pay extra for them.  Drinks are not included, so don't be surprised at the end if your bill is slightly higher than you would pay at any other sushi restaurant. For two people, we ended up paying about 65 Euros for our dinner. We definitely wouldn't spend that much if we went to any other sushi restaurant and ordered individual rolls, however, we also wouldn't have been able to try so many different things. So if you're on a budget, maybe skip this place. The sushi took a long time to arrive. If we ordered sushi in round 2, it would arrive at the same time if not after we had ordered hot dishes in round 3. It also took a long time to find our waiter so we could pay. When one of the servers came and picked up our empty plates, we told him we were ready to pay and he said he would tell his colleague. It took another 10 or so minutes before we even saw our waiter so we could ask to pay again. I took away 2 stars for the slow service and slow food delivery, and the high price."
4,"Such delicious and fresh food, open late which is a bonus. The beef burritos we ordered were very generous in size and as good as anything we've had at home, staff are extra friendly and happy to answer any questions (our German is awful and they didn't mind switching to English to help us order) plenty of tasty vegetarian options too!"
4,"Loved absolutely everything about this place! It's so romantic and cosy, great friendly service, perfect atmosphere and delicious food, desserts and coffee!"
3,"I went here for take-away coffee a few times when I was looking for an apartment in the area. I liked that they have outdoor seating so I could sit outside in the sun between apartment visitings in order to drink coffee and read comic books. Coffee was just okay, though, but service was rather exceptionally cheery. Never got an apartment in the area, but if I would have, I'd hop in here from time to time."
3,"Not the best quality of food, great deal nonetheless. For €4,50 you can get a jumbo Döner. If you're looking for good, fast, cheap food. I would go to Batman the Restaurant."
3,"Brought you the world by the same people as over in Peacestanbul, Mr Kebab is a friendly warm place for friends and colleagues to meet over a good hearty place of delicious mediterranean influenced food. Yes you can get the obligatory Döner kebab but they also have a range of specials to satisfy all tastes. Good for lunch, and fun / cool in the evenings. A nice place to go!"
0,"The W O R S T fish I've had in Hamburg so far!I'll keep it simple stupid:1. The place reeks. 2. The quality of the fish is horrendous as it is frozen and flavourless. 3. Even the sides are not fresh and every bit of nutrition cooked out of them. They only got one star because the staff was friendly. However, I don't go to restaurants because the staff is friendly."
4,Very nice place. Friendly people. Brunch has very good choice of different meals.
2,"This is a snug, quaint restaurant that serves traditional food from Swabia, a region in south Germany, for lunch and dinner. It's cozy with a peaceful ambiance and specializes in Spätzle (Swabian soft pasta) and Maultaschen (Swabian dumpling). There are many vegetarian and vegan options, as well as an English menu.I tried cheese Spätzle with caramelized onions, sheep's cheese, and smoked tofu (all Spätzle is served with a basic side salad) and Maultaschen stuffed with minced meat and spinach. Both dishes were very fresh tasting with seemingly high quality ingredients and nice preparation. However, I was disappointed as I didn't find either lived up to the mostly outstanding reviews this place has. I thought both were good, but I didn't think either was particularly flavorful. I wouldn't go here expecting an outstanding tasting meal, but nonetheless it's a nice little restaurant to try some authentic food."
4,Great place to it with a very affordable price. I think they recently change their chef which now is not as good as it used to be but is still okay
2,"Came here over the weekend as we wanted to check out the Dom but we arrived too early so we walked about 10 min over to Jim Burrito to get some lunch. The place is a bit small and it was packed. There was no line to order so we figured we can just order to go. Luckily as we were ordering a table opened up.I don't think this place takes reservations so you should arrive early to get a good table.We just ordered the burritos, one chorizo and one beef. We were tempted to order the chips and guac but as I saw other tables ordering, I didn't like the chips to guac ratio. Looks like a lot of nacho cheese tortilla chips and a small bit of guac. Also the burritos looked huge and I knew we would fill up on chips and guac and wouldn't be able to finish our burritos later.The wait was a bit long for our burritos. Looks like there is only one chef handling all the orders. There is a sign on a chalkboard letting customers know that the wait can be long so at least they acknowledged this. The burritos arrived after about 15 to 20 min. They are not served in tinfoil and looks like they are grilled on a panini press and then finished in the oven. I am from San Francisco so I expect all my burritos to be in tinfoil unless its a wet burrito so I was weary when I saw the grill marks, the wax paper and the knife and fork. I cut into the chorizo burrito and it looked reasonable - lots of black beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, onions and chorizo. The flavors were good but different then my normal burrito experiences back in the Bay. We dosed the burritos in tapatio and habanero green sauce and that helped kick up the heat and flavors. The chorizo bits were a bit awkward they were a bit chewy and didn't mesh well with the other flavors going on in the burrito.All in all its an OK burrito spot. But as my friend has said, its not exactly the same but it'll scratch that burrito itch when you need it."
2,"Good quality which doesn't go together with service. Pity. The coffee is ok, but very light. Delicious selection for breakfast"
3,"This one is not a restaurant, more a takeaway and a snackbar!I can recommend to take away, because its really full inside and the service its not the perfect one. But if you eat inside (or in the summer outside), the waiter is really nice and helpful!! Food: huge portions and yummy :D Some days,they are really bussy, but you should wait :D and try the dönerteller with fries :D enjoy your food!!"
4,"It's no secret that I'm in love with Lena. However, even if that were not true, I would still give Karlsons five whole Qype stars, as it's truly fantastic. I love the light, airy feel of the place, reminding me somewhat of cafes and bars just north of here, in Copenhagen. Down to business. There's a buffet for sandwiches and salads, but hot food is served at the table. The highlights today were Swedish meatballs, a delicious fish soup, and Danish hot dogs. These dishes proved so popular certain team members even had 2 dinners! (no names mentioned David) Moving on to dessert, and we were delighted to find out Lena had bee up since 4am baking, and the fruits of the oven were indeed mouthwatering - particularly the carrot cake. It's a shame I'm leaving Hamburg today, otherwise I suppose I would have deserted the Milchbar for my new belle Karlsons..."
4,"Always wanted to meet Audrey Tautou? Me too, that's why I spend all of my free time loitering around this particular photo booth. It's of the type that uses intensely bright flash, bubbling chemicals, and only prints in black and white - yielding a hilarious result which means you'll be laughing by the third shot, and therefore get something you like! Compare this to the lifeless, soulless, trashy photo-me monopoly in the UK, with an annoying computer woman patronising you into looking stupid, and you'll be glad you came to Germany. I never did meet Amelie, but I will."
4,"A wonderful French place. Relaxed and mellow, yet with great cooking. We had a enjoyable Sunday lunch. Not updated English menu. Not all positions on the menu were there. But really worth our time and the price for three corse is a bargain."
4,"""Hipster coffee place"" has become to mean something different to me. Instead of meaning "" pretentious "" it became to me a sign of ""quality"" . Now I see it as those people are crazy passionate for coffee. Non hipster places often would have quality depending on who is working today. But this place is true hipster. It is always a good expresso no matter who is working today."
4,"I wanted to eat something other than train station food on my short layover in Hamburg. So Batman was a nice surprise as it was only about a 5 minute walk from the station. I had the Dönor Dürüm for €3.90. It was big, filling, fresh, and really good. Considering I went through Hamburg on trains multiple times during my travels in Europe, I had to stop here every time I came thru."
3,"I thought this place was called Lahmacun, but I guess the sign also says Deniz Imbiss.. Anyway it's a pretty decent little kebab shop, I think - I was pretty drunk at the time I ate here."
1,Too bad. I was not impressed. I had the Rotbarsch Filet. It was greatly disappointing. Absolutely no flavor. The portion was meager. There was a lot more Kartoffelsalat than fish on the plate. Definitely will not go again.
4,"I went here for lunch and had the roast beef, with fried potatoes and salad (it cost 10.80€). We got to Hej Papa at around 12:30 and got the last table. If you are a large company it might make sense to reserve a table or come early. Anyways, might have been the best roast beef I have had here in Hamburg, so really good! The pasta dishes and salads looked really good too, so there's plenty to choose from."
2,"De vraies crepes, incroyable!++* Food: the only reason you want to go there is to eat those dark buckwheat flour 'galettes', which are much healthier and filling than than their crepes counterparts (served for dessert). The latter can be found in any street corner/mall, etc...The chocolate flambee one is a show by itself!* Atmosphere: you want to go there with a bunch of friends to enjoy a bottle of cider. Decoration is refreshing ! The ""Bretagne"" feeling is definitely there. Waiters wear those marine stripped shirts, Jean Paul Gaultier? I don't think so, they have a connected shop within the restaurant where you can buy those shirts. Sweet anyway...* Location: Deichstrasse is one of the few streets Hamburg which doesn't make my eyes bleed. There are other restaurants I'll visit soon or later.Staff: quite friendly & many French, good signs? Locals tend to think so ;)--The place probably lives on its glory time, now that it is quite famous in town it can afford to be less flexible. Case in point: I had an egg galette which came literally with 1 egg on top (really people !?) but then it ""only"" costs 4,1eur. The chicken one is prepared in mustard instead of having the chicken prepared and get the mustard extra/aside... I only see a trick here to keep unsold meat for an extra day in the fridge ( pretty wrong in my opinion)The only place in town for a true galette so go for the refreshing experience!However when everything comes in sugar, cheese or covered in questionable dressing and there is almost no room to adjust the toppings, I doubt that I'll be a regularThey need a serious competitor to wake them up, anyone ?"
3,"I actually had a nice day here at Hagenbecks. The only thing that made me a bit sad was the elephant display. They were reaching out for the apples that you can give to them, but there are these wires that keep them from falling off the edge of the animal encasement (which a big ditch separates them from where the people stand and watch) and they lean up against it to eat, and I can see the markings on their skin from all the leaning into the wire cables and that made me feel a bit guilty feeding them. The monkey display is very cool, you get to see Mandrills which are so beautifully colored but be careful, their hands like to grab anything that comes close to the cage (i.e camera cases, jackets, purses, etc...) and once they grab, it can be a struggle so if you happen to take a private back area tour, just keep this tip in mind!!!The orangoutangs are also very sweet, they have a big dome covering over their exhibit during colder winter months to keep them warm, but during Summer it is wide open and you can see them hopping around and dragging their blankets, playing with one another.  They seem quite happy!Overall, this is quite a nice local Zoo.  Basically when this zoo was build, the concept was not to ""cage"" animals but to let them roam in an open environment, so they use moats here instead of bars.  They have quite a display of animals and in some displays, they even mix animals like they are naturally done in the wild, but of course he does not mix hyenas with zebras! A nice trip for a local to walk around during the day and for a tourist who has time to explore outside of the main Hamburg areas....."
3,"Great place to visit! However, it is quite well visted and you might need to consider evenings. We did book the tour behind and received many great informations and my husband was extremely happy that I surprised him with a visit to some old child memories. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the fact that is too packed with people and it took a long time to see some things because you need to wait."
4,Best Ethiopian restaurant in Hamburg hands down. I am Ethiopian and I haven't had quality Ethiopian food in Germany. My girlfriend also liked it. The place is small and intimate. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to have a good Ethiopian food in Hamburg. P.S. you'd need to get a reservation in advance.
3,"Quan Do's food i good, but the menu is very limited to Pho, fried noodles, weekly offers and some appetizers. BUT nonetheless the Pho I had was delicious as well as the spring rolls. The only thing I didn't like was the staff which was a bit rude (maybe I caught them on a bad day) and the fact that you cannot get Pho to go or take leftovers with you. They only offer a large Pho, which is pretty big, so it's sad that you have to waste the leftovers. Besides that I think the restaurant is great (no sure how much it qualifies as street food though) and I will be going here again!"
4,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and wanted to eat some decent Italian food before the flight. To get here we had to walk 30 minutes, and the weather outside was cold. However, all effort paid back when we got there.First the ambiance - it is a beautiful small restaurant, was not crowded that evening. They are dog-friendly, so they let us in with the dog, gave her some water, and let is pick the table we wanted.Now comes central part - food. We'be ordered pasta with cheese and ham. They clocked it very fast, and as the kitchen was nearby, the smell was impressive and stunning. When they brought us the dishes, pasta was hot, and the sauce was still boiling, this cheesy flavor that burns your mouth a bit but still tastes so delicious. Should I say that after that dinner we both were full and happily walked back to the hotel for 30 minutes!? Highly recommended, even if you need to put some effort to get there."
2,"The German language reviews of Noah's by some of Hamburg's expert Qypers are extremely positive about this small Greek restaurant, but though i found it perfectly acceptable, it was nothing special. On the upside the service was friendly (we were the only people there) and the beer cold and large! There was also decent dip with warm bread to start, but the (chicken) souvlaki seemed dry and without enough grilled vegetables to assist it. And given the emptiness of the place, there was none of the atmosphere one hopes for from Greek restaurants. The lunchtime set menu looks good value and maybe it fills up then."
3,"One of those cafe's that you don't find that often. Small, nice and calm feeling. Almost as stepping in to a livingroom. The coffe is great."
3,"Very tasty semi-upscale food. price is ok. But for real upscale, I had better. Good service. Portions are a bit small. But thats the upscale- thing. Four stars. I do not have complaints, but I think they are trying to be something they are. not quite. Its good, but something is missing."
3,"We tried the brand new American Brunch this past Sunday morning. Being an American I am usually fairly skeptical about anything advertised as ""American"". We arrived at 11 am and had our choice of tables inside or out. It was a breezy morning and we sat on the shady side of the house. (There isn't a sunny side this time of morning at the Chilehaus!) Cushions and blankets made the hard wood benches very comfortable. Our order was taken promptly by a friendly waiter and off we went to the buffet. I was quite happy to see pancakes and bacon as well as two types of eggs (scrambled and soft boiled). For the Brits there were sausages and beans, as well. The ""make your own"" waffles were a big hit with my kids and husband. The buffet also had the typical German breakfast items, such as Brötchen, assorted breads and toast bread, cheeses, meats, jams, jellies, cream cheeses, yogurts, etc. I also enjoyed the more lunch-y items: chili, wraps and steamed veggies. All of us finished our brunch off with a giant portion of fresh fruits. The food was good, well-prepared and quickly replenished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The brunch costs just under 15€ and includes a prosecco, a warm drink and an orange juice - quite a bargain, I think. My one and only suggestion would be to put out those mini glass bowls for the maple syrup. We will surely go back again!"
4,"One of the best zoos EVER!! This is our annual tradition in Hamburg, and we would not continue if the zoo wasn't so spectacular!!! First, feeding the elephants is the most amazing thing. Second, being right in with them lemurs to the point where they jump and sit on you is craziness. The aquarium is top notch. Feeding the baboons is crazy fun for kids of all ages, and finally being face to face with the lions is an experience you can not miss. I would not miss this zoo if you are in Hamburg. Worth every penny!!!!"
3,"If you are looking for upperscale German dining, you'll probably like this. The food was a bit funky for us Americans, but the quality seemed very good. I had the pork steak. The flavors were delicious, but a bit rich and salty. However, I think it just may be cultural difference. The view is of course amazing. The staff was super friendly and spoke English well. That's a big plus in Hamburg. We were going to a concert and wanted to eat close by. Well worth it!"
2,"When XING handed out coupons for free coffee drinks at the new Campus Suite, I was glad to give the place a test-run. Though I can't say I'm a big coffee shop sitter anymore - at least not at big, impersonal chain-type places - I figured it was worth a try.The jury's in: The new place isho-hum. Reminds me of any chain-type coffeeshop in any college town in the states. The woman behind the counter was nice, and I certainly prefer to support a student-run place over Starbuck$, but that's about it. The coffee was fine, but a bit cold and not strong enough. Mine at home is much better, as is the espresso at 'Delikatessen des Meeres' in the Colonnaden (my tip for great coffee and a great lunch, too). How about a new idea for a change?"
4,"I'm always a little leery of expensive restaurants with a great view. Most of the time it feels like you're only paying for the view and the food is an afterthought. Not the case here. The food is fresh, innovative and fantastic. The service is great. The view is amazing."
2,"This Mexican restaurant serves quality and authentic ingredients that deserves 5 stars. However there are some things that make the experience mediocre. For example, the dishes have unique ingredients or are prepared uniquely e.g. cactus enchiladas and chicken tamales. But, the Enchiladas are small and not ""loaded"" with cactus. Everything has too much cheese and the tamales are mostly corn meal, I could not seem to find the chicken in them. The Mojitos were too sweet. Generally Mojitos are made with soda water with dissolved sugar, not sprite with dissolved sugar. Overall food & drink quality 3 star. It took the waitress a while to come to our table (although we were one out of two groups at the restaurant). She also seemed to be more interested in cleaning the bar (which looked perfectly fine) than to serve the customers and avoided eye contact. Also, the food took a long time to come. Maybe it is because of the special preparation required, but an appetizer takes about 30-45 minutes to come before the main entree. The service in my opinion was 2.5 star quality. This place could be better, but there are some improvements that need to be made."
4,"Great food, great place, near the city centre and with a subway station right under it. The room it's huge, with high ceilings and full of chandeliers with low light, creating an intimate (but not boringly romantic) and cool environment. Really friendly staff, and surprisingly relaxed environment. One of the best Italian restaurants I've ever went to! I started with a duck carpaccio (It wasn't raw, so It was tasty!) Tried a spicy Sicilian sausage pasta (I want more!). Finished with a huge Tiramisu (but it was average, although my eyes - and everybody's eyes in the room - were really happy with it's size). There was some kind of wave when they saw my Tiramisu coming. Or maybe it was just the great Sicilian (30EUR/bottle) wine. :)I totally recommend it! High price (45EUR/person with wine), but its worth the effort!"
1,"A bit pricey but nice burgers, although you have to wait at least 30 minutes to get your order. My last visit I ordered fries with a burger, and I waited 30 minutes for a burger after that had to wait ten more minutes to get fries.Good food, slow service. Overall you can find better places in Hamburg, for less price."
3,"Really cool to see but it can be quite packed because of how touristy it is. It was very fasinating how detailed everything was and I can see how people can spend a few hours or even half of a day in here. If you're in Hamburg, it's worth a peek at."
2,"I went there last week and i had the filet. To be totally honest its good but its not GOOD.It's average, unlike other comments i cant say its the best steak I've had nor that's it the best steak in hamburg And maybe they changed the cook since aLii's comment but my medium rare was not rare at all, it was actually almost well done. It was a hard piece of steak.But it's averagely priced, for 18EUR you get a salad and fries or baked potato which is ok! I also had their Bocktail vodka with russian berry! That was absolutely berry delicious :)"
4,"This is not your typical Turkish German restaurant or donair place (although they do serve a great variety of donairs): great quality food, very friendly staff who visibly care about the food they cook fresh, nice seating both in- and outdoors - and all this for a very reasonable price. Impressed."
4,Absoluter Fan. Standard bei mir Habibi mit Hühnchen und Jalapenos plus scharfer Sosse. Ideal für ein schnelles Mittag oder Abendessen!
3,Excellent fresh food and impeccable service. Great place for a date. Gnocchi melted in my mouth and small salad looked and tasted great.
4,Awesome!!!!!  Fabulous food. Great service too.  The Basil soup was to die for.  A must have
2,"Of all the cities in Germany I've been to, the Hamburg Rathaus was probably the most structurally appealing that I've seen.Really just like any other city center though... lots of shops, stores, restaurants, busy area of town."
4,"Imagine being the coldest you've ever been, yet happily chilling at a lovely beach bar sipping on a super delicious Pimm's cocktail and eating what appears to be one of the only 3 vegetarian items on the menu. Are you imagining this?It is amazing. Fun decor, great people, interesting bathrooms, and a really great casual vibe. Come for the drinks and the great view. Eat something so you don't get totally wasted. Drink some more and then vow to return. Rinse and repeat."
2,Good service. This place is well located and not over prices despite being across road from train station. Wasn't crazy for the pilsner beer I had but good selection. Food looks good from what I saw on other tables. Not a bad stop off but you feel like moving on from here eventually...
4,"Still the best Italian place in Hamburg, together with other Vapiano's around the city. There are so many copycats lately coming out but this place keeps the standard very well and everytime when we go there it's a special enjoyment. Everything here tastes good, pizza, pasta, salads, bread..."
4,"I've been traveling in Germany for 2 weeks and this is the best flat white I've had so far! Double shot, right amount of milk and foam. Very velvety! The dark chocolate cookie was also great! The baristas are super nice, made recommendations when I was having trouble decide what to get (their menu is large!). Nice interiors and outdoor seating. Free wifi which is great if you want to work."
2,"We finally tried Jim Block after a year of living in Hamburg. The verdict? As the 3 stars indicate, it was ok--nothing more or less than what I expected I guess. Jim Block burgers are slightly better than McDonalds or Burger King in flavor, but are double in price. The bread used is that familiar super soft, highly processed looking bun that, frankly, isn't made to hold much in between them. This makes JB burgers a fork and knife kind of a meal. The burger patty looks mass-produced, was dry and highly seasoned, probably because of the lack of flavor in the actual meat. The fries tasted very much like McDonalds fries. Ketchup and mayo are 40 cents each and instead of serving the burger in a wrapper, it comes on a plate. I ordered the JB Champignon while my hubby ordered the JB BBQ. Both had good combinations of ingredients, but no matter what you put in it, you can hide that subpar meat. In conclusion, I can see the appeal, but I won't be coming back, at least not on my own volition."
3,"Good burgers, but nothing special. The fried were nice as well. Overall, I'd recommend it to watch some sports."
3,"The place is quite neat and spacious, for such times the seating is very well spread out. Food is mostly good. Got a bunch of dimsums with jasmine tea. Had a few types of shrimp dumplings and rice-rolls, totally recommend. The xiao long bao is a let down though, no broth just the minced pork. And the egg tarts were also okay-ish. We got there at 20:15 and their kitchen closes at 21:00. The waitress was constantly on our back to order and kept reaching for our order sheet (you write your order on a notepad they give you). We had to rush eventually amd write a bunch of numbers for our order."
3,having a cup of really good espresso at marsbar also includes usage of their free wifi (wlan). sometimes you meet some b-celebrities like sylvie van der vart or her husband there. maybe because marsbar is close to RTL nord.its nicer in summer because you can sit outside and smoke.
3,"Looks like a really cool bar, and it was really crowded after 9. I love highball here, basil and New York sour one. But I don't like they allow smoking inside, especially I am not a smoker. When I got home, my hair my clothes my everything smells like cigarettes. Minus one star for that."
4,Really cosy place where you can enjoy a good coffee or hot chocolate in a very friendly atmosphere. :)
3,"Great sushi with perfect size, awesome concept of IPad ordering and friendly staff! All you can eat for 25 Euros = 5 orders of your choice times*10= 50 orders over 150 minutes. The industrial feeling mixed with a Japanese touch goes well together. For the dessert I can recommend the green-tea ice-cream as a perfect end of a great dinner."
4,My first time back in Germany in over 20 years and my first meal didn't disappoint! Great portions and great quality. The dining room had a very fun and laid back atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it here!
4,Wow! Words can't describe how amazing this food is. Fish as fresh as can be and prepared on the spot. It's a cute but very small restaurant near the Alster. Everything is 100% German. :)
1,Food is good but not the service- also charges over 2€ for a tiny glass of tap water. Does not take credit cards? What year is this?
4,"This place is a winner! And who would have known? It's hidden behind Osterstrasse, not far from U-Bahn, impossible to spot.Come and try if you like- wine- modern ambiance- yummy snacks- relaxing summer terrace - good serviceAbout wines: open wine selection is not that extensive, but you can buy any bottle (and they have a great choice), have it served at you table in restaurant with additional 7 eur and bottle of water for free. Not cheap but worth visiting at least once. My five stars."
2,"I went to this coffee shop yesterday super excited after I saw their amazing tools( grinder, aero press, roasting their own beans etc.). I assumed it would be an amazing coffee shop and even brought my sister and boyfriend to show them the great location I found while visiting Hamburg. When we went to order our coffees I learned that they don't carry any non dairy milk which disappointed me a lot. Seeing vegan food options on the menu made me believe they for sure would carry non dairy milk but I was wrong. I passed on my coffee order after making the barrister aware I can't have milk and was offered a chai latte or tea. Button line is...carrying vegan food options but no non dairy milk was pretty disappointing to me."
4,Super cute and fantastic coffee. The bagel sandwiches were delicious and the staff is so friendly. I love this place.
4,"If you are in Hamburg and do not go to Sagner's, you are making a mistake. We were surprised there was not a line around the block given the small restaurant size. We had two excellent apps in the beef carpaccio and the scallops and mushrooms. Make a reservation and go. It is an excellent small family restaurant."
1,"Location, location, location. The view is fantastic - that's it. The drinks are mediocre but pricey, the staff is disinterested and poorly trained. Service is slow and needs to be hunted down. After two hours precisely, we were just about to order another round, he hostess came to our table with the next guests in tow, telling us she needed the table now - no reminder or warning, no alternative offered. There are more bars with better quality drinks and better service in town. Not going back to this one."
2,Great spot for a lunch! Good menu and fantastic location. I had a great kebab here with fresh ingredients and great flavor. It can get very crowded during lunch time so make sure to have enough time to line up and get your food and you won't me disappointed. Great place!
2,"Your typical Irish bar. Probably the most authentic in Hamburg. Very traditional interior. Dark lighting so a good place to come and hide. Very friendly service. The beer's good. Location is easy to reach right on Grossneumarkt. There's outdoor seating during the warmer months. I've only tested some of their food and it was always good. Nothing spectacular but definitely enjoyable. The only thing I really dislike about this place is that at times it can be really full and there isn't that much seating available inside. Further, service can be a bit slow at times and is often pre-occupied with chatting at the bar as opposed to keeping glasses full. If you're into the Irish thing though a perfect jaunt for you in Hamburg."
4,"Snacking might be tricky when you are trying to achieve your fitness goals. I finally stumbled upon the perfect option for whenever I want to cheat a little on my diet. This is by far my ultimate favorite relatively healthy snack in the world and I find excuses out of anything to go there and enjoy either a quarkbecher, a shake or frozen Quark.This time I had the ""Fit Macher"" which has sugar free Quark, fruits and Müsli. But I do recommend you try their more exotic flavors such as Detox Kelch with kale and chia or the ""Warm Up"". In Terms of location, don´t expect some fancy trendy Café or anything like that. It is really just a booth, but their product is amazing so don´t let that disuade you from trying it out. Also sometimes you can find them on Food markets or events around Hamburg. Just Keep your eyes open. You got to try them all!Mucho love,D."
2,"The small Italian restaurant is located in the art nouveau neighborhood of Eppendorf, hidden at the corner of Isestrasse and Heilwigstraße.It comes with an outside patio and two small dining areas inside that are packed all week.Seating can be tight and it might happen that you are run over by other guests and the waiters if you are sitting next to the corridor. It's also very noisy, so don't come here if you are planning a romantic candle light dinner. This place is recommended for dinner with friends or families outings. The food is delicious and I highly recommend sticking with the daily instead of the regular menu. The pasta is awesome as are the meat and fish dishes. A popular appetizer is the calamari dish, which you shouldn't miss.Coming here you will see mainly locals. Be aware of their certain bourgeoisie attitude that might also be adapted by the staff. + cozy restaurant, +popular with locals- tight seating, - noisy, - guests and staff w attitudesAverage entrée: EUR 20."
3,"Delicious food, quick service. Nice selection of soups and salads. Great lunch spot, although you might find it hard to get a seat, takeaway is fine with a nice spot by the river to eat nearby.Always busy, with queues out the door."
4,"This restaurant is located on a small cobblestone street close to Hafen City. The restuarant itself is very small and they only have one table for up to 5 people outside and indoor seating as well. I went there during a non busy time and the place was empty. The lady working behind the counter was really nice and recommended the blackfish with the potatoes and a side salad. I am really glad i took the reccomendation the food was abosolutely delicious! The fish was very fresh and delicious and the potatoes were cooked to perfection. The side salad wasnt bad either! They have fritz cola as well. Between the excellent service, the food, location and price I was really glad I decided to stop by."
3,"Mmmm... delicious, relatively authentic Tex Mex food. Good prices, large portions, quick and friendly service... and yummy! Plus the drink fridge is filled with exotic (read American) drink choices: Dr. Pepper, Cream Soda, Root Beer, Arizona Ice Tea, Corona. If I'm in the Grindelallee and hungry you'll most likely find me here. *The points off are for the cleanliness. If you can help it don't go downstairs to the bathrooms."
4,"If you want authentic and well cooked german cuisine and a delicious in house brewed beer, look no further. This is the place.  Classical german brew house ambiance that at least we love when we are in Germany.  Classical dishes that everyone who has been to Germany recognize. The pumpkin and ginger soup with sesame seeds was real comfort food and would have been even better a cold and rainy autumn evening but was still great this sunny day. Creamy texture and wonderful balance between the pumpkin and ginger.  Since it was chantarelle season (pfifferlinge) they had some nice dishes that highlighted that ingredient. The ""Flammkuche"" wich is sort of a thin crust bread with cheese, bacon, creme fraiche and chantarelles was also supertasty.  Big enough to share and a great deal at 10 €.  The veal wiener schnitzel with fried potatoes was amazing and came (as usual) with a fresh side salad. It was all really really good. My wifes pork knuckle (schweinehaxe) was equally good and she was very happy with it.  This is my new no 1 spot for good german food in Hamburg and i have been there +15 times and tried a lot af restaurants."
4,Super YUM! Walked by and got a seat inside right away. Had Spargel and salmon - it was HEAVEN.Could pay with our Visa card as well and that was helpful as not all restaurants take that.Came back again with a group of relatives and it was amazing again.Definitely can recommend!
4,"Phil's described the perfect day out, and it does indeed conclude in the Stadtpark. Rent a canoe from Saarlandstraße, pack your picnic, beers and cricket set and paddle down the river into the Stadtpark lake. Strip down to your shorts, and jump over board. It's quite a novel experience to go swimming in a lake with the geese and the ducks, and it's fun to see if you can make it to shore without drowning! Good to live on the edge a little. There was some mad stat in the UK recently about the % of people who had never swum in natural water. They need to check this out: wildswimming.co.uk  So, drag yourself on to shore, set up the cricket set and the beers, and prepare for the perfect afternoon. The germans wont have any idea what's going on, and will stroll across the wicket, staring bemusedly at the angry English man wafting his bat around. What is almost guaranteed is that you'll get some friendly Indian, Bangladeshy, Afghan, Australian or yesterday, West Indian come up and have a go at bowling you out. The streets of the West Indies are a fertile home for spin bowling as I found out yesterday! The streets of Afghanistan are a fertile home for some super fast bowling as I also found out last year. If you're really luck they'll call in their mates and then you can have a full on 11 vs 11 and you never know, you might just take a hat-trick. ;-) So, if you're in Hamburg go to the Stadtpark the proper way, in style, arriving and leaving by water. Just watch out for the broken glass and bottle tops when you're running around in bare foot trying to stop Chambers scoring a bloody half century. :-)"
0,"Germany big cities are trying to trend it up with Asian Fusion food everywhere but bare in mind in Northern part of Germany they dont neccessarily find Asians as Beautys.First off, I'm sad this is just another Western water down fast food joint where the quality is shit and everything is over salted and spicy portion dropped for the Scandinavian palate.I recommend for Authentic Vietnames, go to Green Papaya down the street.It's always packed and this is probably reason why others suck cause the Best is always packed and too popular."
4,"A must for all Greek-food lovers! And it is so affordable! I recently was in Rhodes and comparing the food there and here at the Taverna -- I would say it can't get any authentic than this! My first time here I ordered the Calamari + Chicken soulvaki along with the white house wine -- best combination ever! The atmosphere is great-- really reminds me of Greece also with the loud conversations. The staff are great! We arrived but no tables were available so we had to wait but I believe who was the owner came over and accompanied us and asked if we would like something to drink while we waited! We were then promptly seated and the service is also very speedy here. What I would recommend is the Greek Bifteki -- it is ground meat with stuffed feta cheese, I think it is named differently on the menu-- just ask the servers!!! And with almost every dish you can get either french fries or rice and a greek salad.One thing that made me laugh were the napkins cause on the other side it is a mini-greek dictionary for you with phrases that I learned on my Greek trip!!! On our second time around, again busy as ever, no tables but we were then again asked if we wanted something to drink! This time I tried the octopus salad and the Grill platter (with assrt. meats) -- GREAT!!! YUMMY!!! But one thing I shouldn't have done was eat bits of the bread they place on the table -- the servings are plenty -- so you can always eat the bread after if you are not full from your main dish!Note to self: This place is very affordable (our bill for both outings for 2ppl plus drinks(bottle of wine and beers) and tip came to 25euros) and great location in Schanze! There are plenty of selections of meat, fish, vegetarian, pizza, pasta and salads. They also have some sort of German special also, just look at the daily special board. Oh and did I mention there is also a huge tv screen for all those sport lovers who are supposed to be on a date but can't keep their eyes off the screen;) I am going to try the moussaka next time and the guy next to our table had some sort of sizzling plate -- will have to try that also next time!! And perhaps if you are a big group -- make a reservation! Oh yeah you get shots of Ouzo after you pay! And the bill is not paid at the table-- you go up to the bar!"
4,"I always thought of this place like a ""burger place"". Today I've tried chicken wings. What can I say? You just cannot go wrong with both. Make sure you get beer in 1L jugs."
4,Delicious duck. Big quantity in the dishes. I will come back when I will be back in Hamburg
4,Possibly the best Italian food I've ever eaten. We had the set 3 course menu for EUR39.95  starter of a prawn salad on beetroot carpaccio followed by veal with mushrooms in a truffle sauce. An amazing panna cotta with fruit to finish. To top this we had a table with a great view of the harbour. It's not somewhere I would normally eat but great for a special occasion.
1,Staff is far not that friendly as in the US but ok. Food is good!!
4,"Germans are known around the world for their excellence in engineering and attention to detail, and nowhere is that more effectively on display than Miniature Wunderland. Every last bit of the models is breathtakingly designed, and each section is filled with hidden details and Easter eggs. Some highlights include:* The entire place has a day/night cycle, complete with sunsets, colored lights, and every last car, building, and street lamp lighting up in sync with the cycle.* There's a river in one of the areas that has a remote-controlled boat in it, complete with tides achieved by pumping water in and out of the river in sync with the day/night cycle.* The Hamburg airport has a perfect replica, complete with takeoffs, taxiing, landings, and a working departure/arrival board.* Each display is filled with buttons that cause rocket launches, open buildings, prompt volcanic eruptions, and more!* The roads are full of cars and trucks that actually move and obey traffic lights.You can easily spend hours here ogling over every detail. I lost count of the number of times I said ""wow"" out loud. If you're touring Hamburg, just go. You won't regret it, not even a little."
4,I guess Stadtpark is the main park in Hamburg. It's certainly one of the bigger parks and is the best set up to cater for you having a good time: - There are a few beer gardens scattered through the park- There is a huge outdoor swimming pool- There is a huge lawn that people are always barbecuing on- There is an impressive planetarium- There is a boating lake- There is a large outdoor amphitheater where many large bands play (I've seen Neil Young there and also The National) etc. etc.
3,"This is my first Vietnamese restaurant in Germany. It's a cute little restaurant with outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has metal dinning tables with small plastic stools reminiscent of restaurants in Vietnam (which I have just spent 3 weeks in prior to coming to Germany). The green tea is the traditional Vietnamese green tea that I love. I also had the shrimp spring rolls (summer rolls) that came with a fish sauce dipping sauce. The inside is filled with veggies and the very thin vermicelli noodles. Very tasty. I also had the beef pho. The usual hoisin sauce and the plate of vegetables on the side was not served with it like I am used to in other countries (US, Vietnam, etc) but the broth is very flavorful you almost don't need it. The beef is served medium rare over the boiling hot soup. It was kind of chewy but overall still good."
3,It's close to the wonderland. After visiting that I just searched restaurant and choose ti breizh. It's cheaper and more delicious than i imagine. But the passion juice is too sweet.，
4,Very friendly staff and great breakfast. It was also fun to learn about the many different brewing methods and to try something new.
4,"Beautiful French restaurant serving fantastic seafood food. Amazing deserts, carefully selected wine and Bouillabaisse à la Marseille will make you come back! Not many dishes on the menu, but along with fish and seafood you'll see one regional (Northern Germany) speciality which brings an intersting twist. Simply but tastefully furnished. Very polite and attentive service.  And what I found pretty amazing, families with kids are welcome. So if you're put off by snobby French restaurants in Hamburg, try Marseille!"
3,"Great beer, and good selection of dishes to go with it. the staff is friendly and very polite."
0,Worst service i have ever experienced ... 20 minutes wait just to order... 30 minute wait to get food... 20 minute wait to get another drink... 15 minutes still waiting for the guy to deign to bring us the check so we can ask for a to go box... Which will take another hour!! He passes us by to clean a table while were trying to ask for a check... He just walks away... The food is crap as well ... But this seems to be a theme in this city...
3,"A nice cafe sneaked away in a small pedestrian street offering tasty breakfast options like french toasts, pancakes or english breakfast.  The service can be a little slow but the food is great."
2,"If you want a ridiculously over-the-top ice cream, then this could be the place for you. Banana-splits, spagetti-ice cream (it looks like spagetti), milkshakes, etc. they have quite a range. It isn't cheap though. EUR4 for a milkshake and EUR6 for an ice cream dessert. Mostly everything had too much goudi colour for my tastes though. I eventually decided on a vanilla milkshake, which while it was very good, was deceptively small. I finished it almost immediately."
3,Excellent cocktail menu with fun expert bartenders. If I hadn't smelled the bathroom it would have had 5 stars.
4,"I purchased number 6 (Conrad's Favorite) and number 7 (Pink Lady), both tasted so wonderful. This is truly cupcakes heaven. The cupcakes was extremely moist and was well presented goes well with coffee or tea. If you know cupcakes then these cupcakes are the perfection of what a good cupcake is. I had a chance to met with the man himself ""King Conrad"" Hahahaha and must I say he is a character himself, fun, spontaneous and down right hilarious. If you love cupcakes you have to visit this little cute cupcakes place if you are ever in Hamburg and if you are not a cupcakes lover you still have to visit just to see the man behind these adorable cupcakes. Conrad will fills your belly with laughter if you are not a cupcakes lover."
2,"Firstly, the food is simple but tasty. A little bit expensive for some eggs and toast though. We we're sitting for ages waiting to be given a menu, maybe you had to go get one yourself, which I ended up doing. Waited another age to be served, the staff were more interested in cleaning tables. It wasn't even that busy. We didn't get the portions of home fries we ordered on the side and had to remind the girl after our main meal was almost gone. They came out 5 minutes later. All in all, could rate it higher of the staff were a little more attentive!"
2,Good to go with a friend. The cheapest Hendricks gin and Tonic I have found in Hamburg major plus! Shabby chic all the way and a really varied mix of clients.
4,"Absinthe is certainly something different. Run by a couple who had been ""talking about setting up an Absinthe bar for 6 years"", they got around the legal issues of selling such poison a year ago, and are now living the dream. There's something very odd about this place. The ambiance is almost out of a vampire film, and quaffing copious quantities of the green stuff only amplifies it. The selection of spirits is extremely comprehensive. I would guess they basically have everything, and serve it in style. You could also take a beer here, but why would you? If I had to pick holes (apart from the ones in the walls!), I'd be that the seating is not conducive to curling up and going to sleep. I'd imagine this is deliberate! 5/5."
3,A very nice place in Hamburg to go for a walk. One round takes about 45 minutes. The park around the see is very calm and most people use it for running or biking. I have reduced my rating by one star because the places for a potential barbeque are very small and possibilities to clean up the charcoal are very rare in comparision to the Stadtpark.
2,"Not bad! Ok, I had a pretty good time here. The drinks are pretty cheap and from what I can remember, the strawberry daquiri was really good! This is more of a dive bar and get shitfaced kind of place. The music was loud but not too loud thank god. I would probably come back."
1,"My husband managed to book a later dinner reservation to celebrate my birthday. Our reservation was at about 9:30 and the place was still pack. Even with a reservation we still had to wait about 15 minute or so to be seated. Once seated I saw that my husband left a note for them that it was my birthday and they had little happy birthday confetti on the our table which was a nice touch.After that I really didn't have a good experience with the service or the food sadly. Our waiter forgot our appetizers and Everytime we ordered drinks the drink servers looked confused and always ended at the wrong table first before realizing the drinks actually should go to ours. For our meal, we decided on the omakase which was like a 4 course chefs choice menu. Everything was a bit too oversauced for my taste and so the only dish I enjoyed and thought was unique was the dessert (which was more German than Japanese). And when it came time to pay the bill, our server was nowhere to be found...so we had to flag down a different waitress to get the bill.Overall, I probably won't be going back here especially not for a good sushi fix. It's overpriced for what it is and is not my vibe unfortunately."
3,"A great little cafe nearby to where I live. Very designer'ish and liked. Tends to get quite full, be it during the day or in the evening. Their opening hours could be better but I'll take what I can get. Coffee is great and they have good, fresh-pressed juices. The service is always good and they have the nicest waitresses. As a side note, a bunch of people mentioned wLAN. They no longer have a T-Mobile hotspot and I couldn't connect to any open network. The one from next door at Marinehof seems to have also been disconnected. This is a major drawback for me as I can't consider this an office-away-from-the-office without connectivity. I'll still stop in though now and again when meeting people in town for a coffee."
2,"Spent a very pleasant evening here recently. We were holding a small celebratory dinner with 5 business colleagues. The ambience was relaxed, friendly but just formal enough to make it appropriate for this event. Cox has a French feel to it with a menu and wines to match and what looks like a decent small bar alongside, though we didn't get chance to use it (the restaurant was very accommodating given that we put back our arrival by 1.5 hours!)."
4,"This place would have to be the highlight of our trip to Germany. The detail is amazing! I spent three hours there - would have spent three days if I had had the time! A tip: book a place online. You can print out a special timed ticket which gives priority entrance ahead of the queue, a great idea, and beats waiting! But you still pay only when entering the miniature world. Wow!"
4,"Absolutely excellent! We sat on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant for an excellent meal. They brought us an English menu as soon as they could tell we were not German-speaking. If you're looking for the traditional German meal or something new, you'll find both. I had the traditional veal cutlet (weinerschnitzel) while my brother had a fish salad that was also fantastic. The fried potatoes with bacon were to die for. The bread and spread that they brought to start was also very good. A tad pricey, but worth it for a great meal, service, and people-watching location."
0,"I went here for food last night. I'd been before but only for drinks so was looking forward to trying the food. The place was busy enough for a Sunday evening. Sat down at the table at 5:45 and ordered food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly enough but then it went downhill. At 7:00 we still had no food. Our waitress noticed this and went to find out about our food and came back to tell us they forgot our order! As our hunger levels were high and we were in such a bad mood with the service we asked for the bill for the drinks so we could go somewhere else. The waitress apologised and didn't charge us for the drinks. In fairness, I don't think it was all her fault. There wasn't enough staff working for the amount of people in the place. All the staff that were working looked stressed out and were running all over the place serving people. This might have had something to do with their rudeness! If they had more staff working things would probably run more smoothly. I've family and friends visiting Hamburg next month and wanted to take them here but I'm not going to now. It's a shame because the place is really nice and the food that I did see on other tables looked really good."
2,"It's big and interesting. That's about it. Oh, there was some kind of food market/festival going on out front of the place. History buffs will probably find this one a gold mine. frankly, I have a hard enough time keeping track of my own history, much less hundreds of years of shipping industry happenings, so I was more impressed by the architecture than anything."
4,The best place to stay in Hamburg when the sun is shining. I love it
4,"We went last night to Bok as I was in the mood for some asian food. I hadn't been here in years and took a look at the ratings. Was a bit worried as the Bok restaurants have been getting ""destroyed"" in the ratings because of service. WELL, they're listening. I was shocked at how nice our waiter was. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy. He asked every time he walked by whether everything was OK and whether we needed anything else. Almost American style (which pisses me off in the US but is nice to see in Germany). The food is great as everyone else writes. The menu is extensive and you'll find everything to fullfill you Asian eating wishes. The places tend to be full on Friday and Saturdays so consider reserving a table. I also can't wait until HH restaurants become all non-smoking. The place was not well ventilated and the people smoking around us kinda killed the experience and flavors of the food. This is soon remedied. In short, the service (at least at this outpost of Bok) took the bad criticism and made an effort to make us happy. Hopefully we didn't just get a good waiter and the rest suck. It will really be disappointing if I go back and service pisses me off. Then I'll never return as everyone else will simply have been right. UPDATE: We were there last night and service was horrible. We received half of our order wrong and the waitress serving us was less than interested in being good at her job. Further, both tables next to us also had mixed up orders. Finally, to top it all off, the folks behind us ordered something which was grilled at their table. Without my knowing it, my back was covered with oil which was splattering all over the place. My shirt was pretty much ruined and luckily I had my leather coat on a chair on the other side of the table. The management didn't care much about offering a solution for this problem except in hindsight saying I should switch seats....note this is after the back of my shirt was splattered with cooking oil. Finally, the food was less than stellar. The sushi was cut super thing (which was not the case the last time we were there). Additonally, I ordered a grilled beef dish which really didn't taste like much. Oh well, I wanted to like Bok but I won't be returning."
2,"I love places where the barkeepers give meChocolate. And here the location is one of the best in hamburg.The cocktails look good and fresh. They are overloaded with fruit decoration, the stuff is fast and nice.Here comes the but, there's always a BUT:They have a big whisky menu but no real good whisky. The middle class whiskys are just super expensive. The toilets have a good design but they smell and give the impression of not being clean. But they looked clean.The music was very good, I was close to dancing :DConclusion: It's nice to go out if one doesn't want drink whisky, just cocktails."
3,"2 Euro party! This photo both takes the most fantastic pics for 2 Euros! Great way to start or end a party, either way you gonna look awesome. One down side, it's a dirty place!"
3,"Wonderful place with many locals.One of best places at ""Schaze"". Meet youg and ""older"" generation. Weekends nights are getting very busy at this place.Perfect party spot.I had some GinTonic and enjoyed my time there.Service was OK."
4,Great small and cozy place. Love the food and the service. Very nice couple. Details show they care.
3,"Good! Maybe feels a little too casual, caféteria-like for the price level, but food quality was really delicious."
3,Bored on Sunday night and want to drink till 4am with loads of old people instead of thinking about work? Here's your venue!
2,"So yes, the coffee here is quite good (although I would say that it still is a bit short of 'excellent'), and yes, their cakes and bagels are very good. However, I would still not easily recommend going here, mainly because of service issues. First of all we had to wait quite a while before finally being served, while our waitress was chatting away with a friend and other wait staff studiously avoided us - and we only got served after we walked over to her and asked her to take our order, after which either she or the kitchen managed to get us the wrong bagel. Furthermore, it's crowded and noisy and you will be hard pressed to find a comfortable place. All in all, the quality of the food and coffee is severely let down by the service and ambiance."
4,"Hands down the best price to food ratio in the city. All burgers are freshly made to order and they will make whatever crazy burger combinations you throw at them. It's possible to get a burger, fries, and a beer for under 10€. This is a great place to go if you looking to eat a good burger on a budget."
4,"Simple, small place but food is fantastic. Probably the only Indian in Hamburg which offers authentic food."
1,"I must say that I am disappointed. I saw a few cakes that looked great on the pictures on yelp so we decided to have a break there and try two of these. But when we arrived in the store, none of these cakes were here, and actually none of the cakes present that day seemed interesting to us. We ended up taking one slice for two because we both couldn't find something that looked very appealing to us. We ended up with a hazelnut cake with a cassis icing on it. Unfortunately the cake itself was dry and the cassis icing wasn't really good either... We both didn't like it much (and trust me my boyfriend is a sweet-addict, it's pretty hard for him not to like anything sweet..)"
3,"Katze is a cool new bar on the Schulterblatt. As you might guess from the name is a little bit cat-themed, but not much, because that would probably be rubbish. At the time of writing (6 November '08) this bar is so new that it still smells of wet varnish and paint, and the outside of the bar looks unfinished - there's no name for example. The bar staff are mostly young, attractive and blonde. The punters seem to be of a similar ilk, but maybe not quite as blonde. There are free bar snacks on every table, but they don't serve any hefeweizen. However they make up for this small oversight by serving Augustiner brau. It'll be interesting to see how this one develops, but things are looking good at the moment."
0,We were two Danish guys being treated very hostile as if they don't foreigners. Don't go there if you're not German
4,The restaurant has the original Vietnamese ambient very nice. The food is authentic. Will be back for sure
4,"After getting a late start in finding a place for dinner, very few restaurants were still open. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we discovered wonderful Cappricio. Very nice house wine, excellent Caprese salad, amazing truffle linguine and a beautiful chocolate mousse dessert made for a memorable meal. But the star of the evening was the service. Friendly, attentive and helpful. Definitely will come back."
3,"Kumpir is a little gem of a place on Schanzenstr. Basically they only sell baked potatoes, and the most expensive thing on the menu is EUR3.90, and that's what I went for. A mexican-themed baked potato. It came with cheese, chicken, salsa, nachos tomatoes and jalapenos. It really hit the spot. I'll definitely be back."
4,"The light show is really beautiful. I wasn't going to go, but changed my mind at the last minute. I quickly taxied over from my hotel and got out and ran to the park. I was able to make it there by 10:15 (it starts at 10:00) and the show lasted until 10:30. I sat on the side of the lake opposite the large tower on a cement block. It put me the closest to the fountains of anyone, but this also meant I got pretty wet. If you don't mind getting wet, I would also recommend going for that seat."
3,"A great roof-top bar in Hamburg, in the very center of the city. The very top level is open, so absolutely fabulous during the summer. The place is a bit pricey, but it's worth going there for a beer or a cocktail. In the evening, you might need to book a table.I highly recommend this bar, it's absolutely magic!"
3,"Ah, it's just like being back in Munich! I love Munich, unlike most northern-germans, and the only thing this place is missing is a giant BMW factory. Authentically dressed waitresses serving up cheap grub and beer on benches. The size of your schnitzel is inversely proportional to the amount of sauce you get, hence Wiener Art - massive, and Jager, moderately sized. I really like it here."
4,"Fantastic burgers!!! Hands down one of the best I've had. The burgers are cooked very well (I recommend medium) with lots of flavors from the portables mushrooms and spinach. Highly recommend the Truffel burger with 1 patty (about 8 euros) with the pale ale beer (about 3.8 euros). The Pommes are excellent as well, you can get 1 to share. Definitely try it out!"
3,"Good place to get lunch! They seem to have three different meals to select from (not sure if threee different every day) and it's really affordable (3,90 EUR for a ""regular""). Tall costs a bit more, but I am not sure if you need that - I felt stuffed. :) Usually Indian places in Germany don't season the food very much, but this place is different. Pretty nice, especially since this is not a ""real"" restaurant, but a fast food joint."
4,Nice feature! A must have souvenir.
2,"This is just another bar on the Reeperbahn that you'll never remember the name of after you stumble out in a drunken haze. The only reason I can remember is that I took a photo! On the weekends it's really busy, loads of mental dancing and drunkenness. On the weekdays they have EUR5 cocktails until midnight - not a bad deal."
4,"The best quality espresso bar in Hamburg. I used to live upstairs, so I was a regular. They have a very cute Instagram account, too! The layout is minimalistic and I love their blue espresso bar!"
3,"Unless you are dining alone for weekend brunch, you need only look to the bottom of the Frühstück offerings and order the Victoria & Daniel. It pretty much has everything all of the offerings above have (combined!) and then some.Swedish pancakes, homemade applesauce, lingonberry jam, amazing homemade breads, butter, a mountain of cream cheese no one can finish, an assortment of cheeses, delicious savory and buttery mini quiches with specks of bacon, rich and extremely flavorful homemade veal liver pate, surprisingly excellent herring, hard-boiled eggs, fruit salad, and a small assortment of local veggies. Yes! You get all of that. You also get a gratis helping of ""where the heck do I start!?!"" and a glass of prosecco or orange juice as well. Skip breakfast, skip lunch, do brunch...here."
4,"Stopped by for lunch to realize that the dining room was closed (didn't plan ahead) so we made dinner reservations on the spot. It was mid-week and they were pretty much booked but we snagged a spot for a late-ish dinner.While we waited for our table (we were early), we enjoyed well-prepared cocktails at the bar. Were seated after a very short wait, drinks in hand. Ordered the Entrecôte which comes with corn on the cob, a salad, and your choice of one sauce or butter. I also opted to add a side dish of Kartoffel Röstzwiebel Stampf--a warm, savory, and buttery potato and onion mash which rounded out the meal quite well. Steaks were tender and perfectly cooked, portions were fair, and service was prompt and friendly. Chimichurri sauce was a bit bland but the herb butter was lovely. The house red wine was priced modestly and complemented the steak very well. The table next to us  ordered the ""surprise"" three course meal which consisted of a salad, fish with vegetables, and ice cream dessert. It appeared tasty and they seemed to enjoy it. The space is vast and open with low backed booths and wide and comfy chairs which makes it easy to observe what's going on all around. It's a bit loud, but tables are large enough to give each party enough space. Restaurant is busy, but the bustle isn't intrusive and staff was pleasant across the board. Location is convenient and the restaurant is easy to find. Experience was overall very positive and we're glad we checked it out."
4,"A wonderful authentic German resturaunt. The cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and accomdating staff make for an outstanding experience. Do make a reservation!"
3,"If you come to Hamburg on Sunday morning you will visit the Fischmarkt. You have to be there very early and after a walk and bargaining with different Fischmarkt-sellers, you will need a place to chill. If you follow the way from Fischmarkt to St. Pauli-Landungsbrücken, you pass Strand Pauli (that means Beach Pauli. And if it is summer and if the sun shines, you can sit on sofas or beachchairs or even lie on a queensize bed, drink Cocktails or have a breakfast, or snacks like Hamburger. The prices are a little bit higher than in a Pub - but when you see, that you have a beach in the harbour and can watch the ships passing by (as we saw the Sadov today) it is worth the money. We paid 10 Euros for 3 very well served non alcoholic drinks."
1,"Location is nice but the lady who served us was very unprofessional and hostile.The manor in which the order was taken made us feel unwelcome. Some of our orders came out wrong and she argued with us instead of offering to fix it.The food was fine but not worth dealing with this particular member of staff.Very disappointed with the service, I can not recommend."
1,"After trying this place twice I can't honestly say I would go back. The food was ok, not great, but ok. It seems that kidney beans are quite expensive as I never seemed to get very many in my burritoWhat was bad is the waiting. It has both times taken a little longer than 1hour. The argument is that it takes 45 to bake them. There are faster ways that are equally good, if not better. Only go there if you don't have any appointments afterwards"
2,It's at least interesting. Every meal is potato and something. Was an OK meal but I won't be rushing back.
4,"Really amazing place. If you arrive early, you can look in the gift shop (lots of chocolate, recipe books, and chocolate related things). The auto museum is also nearby. I took the English tour and it was really great. There are a lot of chocolate tastings along the way (think every time you stop you try something) and our guide was extremely helpful in answering all questions and very interesting (and spoke very good and clear English). Making your own chocolate bar is very fun (and you can sample the add-ons). It's also really interesting to try the chocolate at all steps of its preparation. I would definitely recommend doing this if you're in Hamburg. Be aware that you have to buy tickets for the tour time you want online (no rescheduling). I've left out pictures of the samples themselves because it's more fun to be surprised by them."
4,Germany's freshest. Simple place with super friendly staff. Excellent dishes all around our family of 4. Deserts were amazing too!  Given our variety of our dishes my conclusion is that you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!  Go!!!!
1,"Went there on a Sunday for brunch+ or the reasons why you want to go there* Location & Atmosphere: The only reason you want to go there. At water level, still central but not overwhelmed with the crowd around the Alster a few meters away. Terrace is much larger than inside the restaurant, so you want to go there only on a sunny/warm day. There is also a possibility to sit on stairs with a drink facing the Alster and the city tower.* Food: For brunch there is a corner for 13,8EUR (drinks not included) with deli meats, smoked salmon, green salad, tomato mozzarella, veggies, scrambled/boiled eggs & white/wholewheat bread.- or the no go* Staff: a BIG downer, damn, the ladies there make you want to either go away or throw something at their faces. Attitudes (What for?) / Withering looks (need a moisturizer?) / Fish faces (Aquarium?).If you decide to go, do your best to ignore their lack of customer oriented skills (euphemism)* Food: 13,8eur is overpriced for what's served. Not a single dessert / cake on that buffet corner.The only veggies plate (eggplant, zucchini, carrots) available bathes in oil.Scrambled eggs look like there are made out of an omelette mix powder (really!?), I stayed away.All in All, You pay for the location which might be cool on a sunny day but even for that, staff might ruin the experience... too bad, I wont go again.  I do not recommend the place."
4,We were staying nearby so decided to try it out. We liked it so much that we ended up coming here consistently our entire short stay in Hamburg. Staff is incredibly friendly and the space is minimally but very nicely designed. I tried both the cappuccino and flat white and preferred the cappuccino. The carrot cake is the best I've ever had. Ever. The cake itself is rich and not sweet with a wonderful texture and the frosting is buttery and delicious. Perfect! Will return the next time I find myself in Hamburg.
4,"Finaly we decided to drop by this tiny restaurant which we are passing almost every day while we cycle to our work. I must say all the time I had bad opinion about this restaurant, judging by outside look, but once we entered in I immediately recognized that I was wrong. It had pleasant atmosphere with nice smells and welcoming staff (I guess owners). From first view on menu I could feel that here they have good food. I ordered pasta pesto while my wife had some type of fruit soup. It was really delicious and my pasta was even better than in Vapiano, for which I was thinking is far Nr. 1 in Hamburg. I can only say that Sagners is coming on our short list of local restaurant where we are going for lunch breaks."
4,"The world's biggest model railway. Impressive. And around it, the world, miniaturized. It is quite an amazing experience going here, which is why we do it so often :) Crazy attention is being paid to detail, much of which you don't actually even notice on your first tour through. There is a hidden Atlantis part, there are a bunch of couples having sex hidden throughout the landscapes, there are undersea caverns with sunken ships... great fun to try and investigate every corner. The light installations are also lots of fun: in one hour of real time, the Miniaturwunderland goes through several sunsets, nights, and sunrises, during which the lights fade and change color and the lighting in the scenes goes on. Quite a sight, definitely recommended. PS: Make sure you reserve/buy tickets in advance, or you might be standing in a queue for two hours, during which you will get snacks and drinks, but still. Or come really early."
4,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, definitely one of my favourite bars in Hamburg. The sofas look as if time traveled from last century, and you'd probably not want to look at them during daylight, but they're so comfy and worn down, they practically engulf you when sitting on them. Drinks here are decent, but not great, but you'd probably come here for the atmosphere and the people anyways."
2,"I was having a nice stroll as I often do in this gorgeous Hafencity I live in, and stumbled up this cafe, tucked inside a brick building around the corner from the Speicherstadt.  The decor really draws you in because there pasty case boasts a nice selection of desserts alongside a bar that opens up to a seating area blended into a mini gift shop filled with books, cards and such. I chose a window seat so that I could not only peek outside but get an overall view of the room.  Great place to lounge with friends because the layout is open and cosy. It feels more like you are sitting in someone's home dining table than in a cafe/restaurant. The meals range from light and healthy to rich and hearty homemade dishes.  I happened to be in the mood for wine and a dessert so I ordered the Kaiserschmarrn.  The wine was very nice, she suggested a glass of French,  Côtes du Rhône.  I really love this dessert, Kaiserschmarrn tastes to me similar of a thick pancake but with the sweet flavors of a sugary donut and served often with a side of berries or sauce.  My favorite is when they serve it with vanilla ice-cream, a dopple of whip cream and sprinkled with a few fresh strawberry slices. Here it was served mainly plain and a bit overcooked and too sugary.  I ate it nonetheless, but would it have been a bit fluffier and moist, I would have enjoyed it more.There is a lunch buffet for those in the area looking for a quick stop, as most people frequenting this area are there for work or tourists taking in the many sights. The main menu is very German with a mixture of Austrian and Northern traditional Hamburg recipes served. Meat and fish are the main components and though it is not an extensive menu of options, there are enough fine choices and it really does feel like a home cooked meal and atmosphere. Prices are a bit higher for such a cosy looking cafe, but I imagine it has much to do with the location being nestled in the main Harbor and historical landmark of the warehouse area.I had the Hamburger Pannfisch once for lunch and it was delicious.  This location is really great to go with a friend for cafe and dessert or even a nice quiet dinner if you happen to be in the area or it is also great for going alone and relaxing with your own thoughts after a nice walk along the Speicherstadt.  During the day, a good spot for a casual meeting on one of the sofas near the window."
3,"Simple cuisine, friendliest waitress and great terrace to have some fresh mint tea in a sunny day!"
4,"As an Asian, I have to say the dish: number 54 reminds me of what I had back in  Asia. Really great and I'm positing this for the Asians, if you want really good 酸笋鸭米粉汤面 ( duck with bamboo, #54)this is the place! There is no other places in Hamburg which has this soup! (in 2015) The service was good and fast. taste exactly like what I expected a Vietnamese restaurant should have. ;) PS : I'm also positing some pictures , which I would recommend to order. ;)"
4,"While traveling through Europe we had the good fortune of trying the St. Georg Steakhouse. We had just arrived in Hamburg and were hungry for something substantial, so we opted for a steakhouse. We ordered the Ribeye Steak and a glass of Montepulciano. The steak was the tenderest, juiciest, most succulent piece of meat I ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The waiter spoke English and was prompt and efficient. The ambiance was quiet and enjoyable. We were able to carry on a conversation without having to compete with loud music. We loved our ribeye steak so much we went back for another on our last day in Hamburg. If I ever go back to Hamburg I will visit the St. Georg again."
2,"If u r searching for a good cocktail bar, it's what u r looking for. Awesome atmosphere and nice drinks! But the food isn't so tasty. Good thing is they offer gluten free meals! I'll say better to go there as a bar rather than restaurant."
2,"(M)eatery is a drop in the recent flood of upper class steak houses that has beleaguered the Hamburg food scene recently. That said, word-of-mouth had been rather positive, so I prepared my inner carnivore for a feast. Interior design is, of course, a matter of personal taste, but (M)eatery's rather cool interior rather didn't appeal to mine. Service was swift and friendly, so a (M)eatery Deluxe Burger was ordered quickly. The burger was explained at length in the menu as a very elaborate and distinguished piece of meaty cuisine, so my expectations were rather high. For a price of EUR 18 one gets a beef burger with shallots, home made chips and Wasabi mayonnaise. One even has the choice of different kinds of rolls. Regrettably, what came out of the kitchen didn't warrant the rather lengthy and somewhat pretentious explanation in the menu. First of all my burger had been cooked very medium instead of medium rare (as I'd ordered it); the Wasabi mayonnaise is plain silly, as its very dominant taste simply doesn't suit this kind of dish. But worst of all were the chips, which were very soggy and fatty indeed. Still feeling a bit hungry I, somewhat cynically, ordered soufflé for desert, wondering if the kitchen could actually handle such a delicate dish. Alas, I should have known better: the soufflé was served far to quickly to have been made properly, so what I got in the end was a decent, but uninspiring mixture of a cake and flan. Would I visit Meatery (already fed up with the spelling) again? If I was invited, probably yes, but not for my own money. I guess the search for Hamburg's No.1 steakhouse continues."
2,"A quick and easy walk from the Miniature Wonderland, this side street cafe has a nice outdoor seating area and the service was very good. The pizza was tasty as was the spaghetti bolognese.  Not a long wait at all to get the food but the beer was kept cold and full while we did wait!"
0,Service is very slow. Took us over two hours since we sat down to finally get our food. Unbelievable. This is on a Tuesday night. Food was mediocre at best. Will not return.
3,"Enjoyed a ham omelette and half a bowl of fruit salad with quark, along with my first Fritz-Kola here last Sunday before heading off to see St. Pauli lose. As mentioned by a previous reviewer the need to order at the counter & also go back to pay can result in a bit of standing around as the customer ahead of you may be having half a dozen coffees made for them to cart off, rather than just placing an order or paying but that's just a First world problem to be sucked up. You'll stand around in a lot worse places in your life."
4,Possibly the most beautiful building in Hamburg. It still impresses me after many years in Hamburg and I'm always finding out new things about it.
3,"Cool, hip and funky. We sat on sofas in the window and didn't want to get up!Reggae easing through the speakers, cold augustiner and friendly bar staff. We were immediately give a glass of free nibbles which is always an a+ in my book.Wanted to have a quick drink and then meet friends but that turned into a few drinks and a change of plans, friends came to us and we chilled out and watched as the sun went down and the area came to life.(One little note for the geeks: dyson airblade in the wc, for me its cool when places use up to date technology!!!)Go there, you wont regret it!!"
2,"Came here looking for the infamous last drink, after dinner but, before going home!Impressed that I was able to find somewhere to hang up my coat let alone be able to get to the bar and have service!!  whoop whoop.  Quick with delivering out cocktails we were also able to find some table space.  All this in the run up to Christmas, cold night and in a reasonably packed bar.Dimmed lighting and music providing fun atmosphere.Friendly staff and people.  Towards the end of the night, we even had table service a plus for me.  Gotta love table service in a bar!!The only downside to this bar was the ability to smoke inside.  Not a fan of smoking and not used to smoking inside for a while now, this was a shock to the system, my clothes, hair and lungs.This, for me was the only down side to this bar.  Although, would come again.  :)"
0,"The pros:   * thoughtful, attentive , gracious service;         * casual atmosphere with solid wooden tables;         *  the pizza has great texture, with crispyness outside and a softened interior crust loaded with gooey, bubbly cheese;        * when I couldn't decide between two pizzas, the server offered to make the pizza half and half - - really appreciated that!The cons:    * the pizza was a salt bomb - - the meats are salty, the cheeses are salty - - but even the CRUST is excessively salty;  each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by salt - - since I got half  'Salsiccia und Peperoni'  and half  'Speck und geräuchertem Scamorza'  I thought the other half would have more character and be less salty - - but uh uh - - and this really overwhelms the contrasts of flavor of the individual ingredients;     * you are served bread and a dip to start - - the bread is forgettable, and the dip tastes like pure mayonnaise - - godawful;        * the many little peperoni tasted like the brine they are packed in from the can or jar - - they are anything but fresh - - and they still had the stems on, so you had to either try to surgically remove the stems without destroying the pizza underneath,  or eat them as is and try to spit out the stems;         *   the salsiccia were little round blackish balls that rolled around on the slice when you tried to eat them, and had little flavor since they were overcooked;         * I ordered a kellerbier,  and it was foul - - either they have no turnover so the keg is old,  or they haven't cleaned the lines in a long time - - or both.Would I eat at Ai Volo again?    Even when in the mood for a bubbly, gooey, beautifully textured 'za - - I wouldn't eat that salt bomb again,  and I now don't at all trust their choice and blending of ingredients.  I wouldn't drink a beer there again either."
3,"Nice little park between Hoheluft-Ost and Harvesthude. There's lots of space to picnic here on a sunny afternoon, benches to lay on and enjoy the sun and plenty of room to play ball and barbeque. The park itself is circular, so taking walks around the park lead you straight where you started off :)"
1,"Sotiris ..... Well ...... It was quite an experience ..... A bad one, mostly.... Ok, maybe the food was let's say 'ok', and the prices were good, BUT ...a 'greek' restaurant with arabic decorations that the owner (or the manager, I wouldn't know for sure) treats a GREEK customer (that goes for the first time and very excited) like s*** ... well ... for sure I wouldn't go back .... I haven't experienced so rude behavior EVER. And even though I called from the hotel to do a reservation and told me it wasn't needed, I got there and they told me they were full booked. I waited (even though I should have left) and I sat with other 2 people I didn't know, after being asked -in greek- 'so,what do you want?' (!!!!!). They told me they'll change my seat later but didn't. Awful smell and treatment. Talk about 'greek hospitaliy' ... BS I say ... I'm guessing the participation (and publicity) from Adam Bousdoukos (Soul Kitchen movie) didn't help much, or if it did (as in my case) it won't help in the future. They need to learn some manners !!!!!"
2,"Surprise to find this place. Food are not bad,  but not surprisingly good anyway. Very friend staff, we really enjoyed it. We like the duck and dim sum which are very good. The beef rice noodle are so so, could be worse. The owner seems well connected so he has many pictures with famous politicians."
3,"Had a lovely dinner at this cozy lakeside restaurant. Really reasonable for pretty sizable portions of delicious dishes. Three of us shared three entrees. We tried the daily special which was a whole white fish of some sort with crispy skin. Then three fish fillets that included what seemed to be salmon, halibut and another meatier white fish lightly fried and served on Dijon mustard sauce. We also tried the famous labskaus dish which looked like raw minced meat. I was alarmed until I realized it was warm and was the color of beets. Everything was served in generous portions with sides of pickles and vegetables and so on. The only thing we didn't care for was the risotto. Very nice service by a lovely host who spoke English. Recommend making a reservation. Good for a date followed by a lakeside stroll. ;)"
1,"Meh. If you're single and looking to mingle on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, Sausalitos might be a good place to start. Their drink menu is pretty impressive, but I found the Mexican food subpar. Not worth the money, in my opinion. On the weekends it feels much more like a club than a restaurant. I'd go again with friends for drinks, but I won't be paying for a meal again."
4,"Luhmanns was a pleasant surprise. The tea house was very charming, it had an old world feel. They had a nice selection of teas and cakes. Top notch atmosphere and a very pleasant staff. This was a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon."
3,"I like this place a lot. We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon not knowing quite what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised. It seems new, the staff is nice, and the food is good.The floor plan is a bit odd... the entrance is alongside the pizza kitchen, with a huge countertop and a giant red oven. Towards the back up a short flight of stairs is the dining room, which probably seats about 40 or 50 people, and is decorated in a minimalist, trendy way with plants growing in gutters along a side wall.The menu is mostly pizza, along with a few appetizers and a few salad options. They also have a pizza-based dessert which is chocolate raviolis made with pizza dough. We didn't try dessert on our first visit, but it will probably happen at some point. There is also a surprisingly long drink menu; everything from coffee and tea to beer and wine, and cocktails to boot.I ordered the special pizza, which was fennel sausage, roasted red pepper strips, and shaved parmesan. My wife had the portobello pizza, which has ricotta instead of tomato sauce, and is topped with mushrooms and truffle oil. Both were delicious and filling. There's a lot of advertising around to tell you this, but these are meant to be Neapolitan-style pizzas which are baked in a 400C oven for 90 seconds. As a result, the pizzas come out mostly cooked, but still a little watery, and the crust never gets terribly crisp. (I don't mind, but apparently this bothers other Yelpers.)In the ""How is it for kids?"" department, our daughter was greeted with a coloring book and a jar full of colored pencils, and when it came time to ordering, we were able to get her a smaller kinder-pizza withOUT (this is the most important part) any green seasoning (oregano) whatsoever. They are very accommodating of picky kids.I liked the vibe a lot, and the food was good. I'll definitely be back."
3,"We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1:30. The restaurant was mostly empty except for one other table, but there are two small dining rooms, so it didn't feel too desolate.We ordered the lentil soup, the paneer pakoras, the mango curry with vegetarian meatballs, and the chicken biryani. The waiter was very patient with our German pronunciation of Hindu(?) words, and mostly ended up writing down the numbers of the dishes, so you can save yourself the trouble by just giving them the dish numbers.The food was quite good. We had some pappadams with a few tasty chutneys at the beginning (this is free/included). The lentil soup was really flavorful and had some fresh herbs on top that made it delicious. The mango curry was also quite good, with a very strong cardamom flavor (which my wife was into, but was a bit much for me), and served with a side of rice. The chicken biryani was a bit mixed for me. The chicken was boneless (I would have preferred the bones), but cooked to perfection. The rice included a tremendous amount of vegetables (zucchini, cauliflower, green beans, more than I've ever seen in a biryani), and was highly sauced, perhaps too much. It was a tremendous amount of food; easily twice as much as I could eat.The prices are higher than I would have expected (approx 5 euro for soup, 13 euro for curry, 15 euro for biryani), but it was a lot of food, and we ended up bringing some home. I'll come again sometime, but only when I'm really hungry."
4,"Best little falafel place on the 'schanze. Friendly staff, great value, and most importantly really tasty authentic falafel. Their Kimo Falafel is my own tip. Can get crowded in the smallish seating area but never feels uncomfortable."
3,"I love the taste of the coffee, the cake, the Alster view, everything. Service is nice. A little more smile would give 5 stars :)"
3,"Great spot to hang out, just off The Reeperbahn and away from the craziness. They play great music, the bartenders are fantastic and the crowd are a good bunch. Since it is just off The Reeperbahn, it is GREAT people watching.....just park yourself by one of the windows, grab a drink and peer out at the mix of locals, tourists, hookers and the rest of the lot. You can easily waste away hours drinking and dancing (if there's room). I HIGHLY recommend when you inevitably find your way to this delightfully seedy part of town."
3,"A really great falafel place that has cosy seating area and nice food. It's downstairs, really roomy, and free newspapers give you a reason to stay for a bit longer and make more of a meal of your falafel rather than wolfing it down and bailing again straight away. I guess at a pinch the falafel at Falafelstern tasted a smidge better but overall given the ambiance here, and the similar pricing, it is an all-round better package. The falafal certainly was large for the price of E3,50 and the service was friendly. If you are in Hamburg longer then go here and Falafelstern and you will be happy!"
4,"I seriously can't believe that I forgot to review Gloria. Busy busy I guess. Anyway I've been a few times for their Sunday brunch buffet. It's not cheap at EUR13, but boy is it good! Check out the photos..."
2,"This place was weird. But then againanything is weird after drinking 1.5 bottles of wine before going out with your friends. Was there on a Saturday night and it was completely crowded and kind of sweaty. Someone grabbed my butt a couple of times, one other guy tried to put my coat on his girlfriend he was so wasted and in the backgroundGod awful euro-trance-house-crap that was pretty relentless. This was the upstairs. Moving onto the downstairsta da! We are now in the mid-30's zone complete with German style rap/grind/singalong antics. I don't know about you, but watching Berta and Hans get it on in their tight Euro jeans does something sad to your soul. Oh yes, another Pilsner bitte."
3,"Feld's Salat makes a respectable lunch salad, and apparently everyone else thinks so, too (it's one of the few places in Hamburg where I've seen people queued up for lunch). I've been a handful of times now, and never really had a bad experience. I think my favorite salad might be the Ziegenkäse (goat cheese) salad, which is a pretty normal salad until they drop a huge hunk of broiled goat cheese on top. It's good. I've also had the caesar's salad, which comes with chicken, and is pretty tasty (but a little heavy; defeats the purpose of eating salad for lunch).The ladies behind the counter are surprisingly friendly for how relentless the line of customers is, and the seating is somewhat limited but turns over quickly. Definitely up there with Green Lovers as one of my favorite salad spots near work."
3,"Stylish place just past the Mercado, about 3 mins walk from Altona station. It's fairly dark and swanky, but the prices aren't too inflated with an Augustina Brau at a fairly standard EUR3.50 a bottle. Good, and indeed, good looking, service, and cool beats. There's a smoking room out the back but down let your friends trick you into sitting in there as it's bloody freezing!"
3,"I ate here a few nights ago (on a Saturday) we were lucky to be able to reserve a table - booking is highly recommended. We visited for the traditional Bavarian experience, we weren't disappointed. Drinking litre beers from steins and feeding on schnitzels (huge) the evening ended watching the traditional Bavarian band and sinking a few shots of Jagermeister. Great way of experiencing the Munich beer houses in Hamburg."
0,"I have been to this place today after reading so many positive reviews about it. I had to drive all the way around 40 minutes on a rainy day. To make it short: the location at Steindamm 58 isn't the best or worst either, at least it didn't bother me at all. Even though my first impression was negative right after i entered this place, I queued up like others for the pos register. I ordered a so called jumbo durum for 5.00 euros even, and a beverage for 1.75 euros. I hat to stay in the queue to receive my order. While waiting I had the chance to observe that previously prepared various meat products were unsavorily displayed to customers despite being partially spoiled. But I stayed in the line, because the durums were allegedly prepared fresh. Finally it was my turn to get my order. The meal was a huge portion of a freshly baked  thin flatbread some cut of grilled ground meat with mixture of a salads. The meat wasn't hot enough, some parts  were not evenly cooked, some other still raw. I really was hungry, but couldn't swallow the first bite and had to immediately leave that horrible fast food place! Honestly I was extremely disappointed and wouldn't waste my time again, so to speak not even under any given circumstances..."
4,"As a non-smoker I only ever visit Duske & Duske to get my fix of English-language magazines, but their selection is surprisingly large (for automotive titles, that is) and the service is impeccable, in an understated, Hanseatic fashion. I think it's also much more charming than getting the mags at the train station anyway. Once I bought some cigars as a present for a friend, who told me they were top notch quality - they better be, for Duske & Duske's range isn't exactly cheap, but the helpful and competent assistance was a great bonus, particularly as I had no clue what I should buy."
4,"Great coffee, great price! The place is cozy and it knows what it's doing. Nothing more to say. Would definitely recommend to drop by!"
3,"I stopped in after ready all reviews, I code the Eva's chicken burger with cheese, reminds remoulade  sauce and potatoes,  everything was great, potatoes were cooked perfectly, the chicken burger was perfectly cooked and the best part was the remoulade sauce.  I really recommend this quaint little place."
3,"Nice place to have good burger for lunch. Most of personnel speak English which is good. Prices are decent, also I would recommend to share fries with a friend, because I never manage to eat it myself. Only thing they're missing in my opinion is some Menu option (Burger+Fries+Drink), otherwise very nice place."
4,Good and cheap place to eat kumpir. Great variaty of kumpir. Big sizes and good prices.
3,"A nice spot for lunch or dinner and will be even better once the new Elbe Philharmonic Hall opens up,.  Carl is actually several restaurants sharing the same building - casual bistro, a more formal brasserie, and a private room and bar downstairs.  Went here for a group dinner at the Brasserie, and ordered a special 3 course dinner for 39 euros.  Each of the courses was well-prepared -  a salad, followed by steak, and then creme burlee, but perhaps not the most exciting preparations.  But the service and atmosphere made for a very enjoyable evening."
3,"On our first night in Hamburg after making the big move from SF, we had our celebratory dinner here. Badshah wasn't hard to find though the signage might not be super obvious when it's dark. The restaurant is pretty small, but tables seem to turn quite fast. We each ordered the Thali plate, mine with the chicken tikka masala and his with the palak paneer. Both were very tasty. I ordered the mango lassi as well and it was probably one of the better mango lassis I've had. Service was quick, the staff was friendly and price point was decent. Overall, very on par with anything we'd get in San Francisco, which is great!"
3,"Fabulous sushi! We could not sit outside as we arrived 5 people instead of the 4 we had booked for but there was no problem as during lunch hour there was plenty of space inside (apparently booking is a must for evenings). We were seated close to the kitchen/counter which was a little noisy. You can order a mixed platter to share or if you are picky and a vegetarian like me you can go for individual rolls. The 3 I ordered on recommendation were waaaay too much, go for two if you are real hungry and one for a snack! They have a veggie roll with tempura inside which adds a yummy crunch and extra taste, the other veggie roll I had was kind of bland in comparison. There are also other hot food options if you like neither sushi nor fish, and this is where they are losing one star for me as there's meat, there's fish, but there's nothing vegetarian (this, and the one ""boring"" roll I had). The restaurant has a nice atmosphere too and can seat larger groups so if you want to dine out with sushi lovers it's the perfect place."
3,"This is very personal restaurant with high ambitions and with good natural wines, which is a bit hard to find in Hamburg.Absolutely worth a visit!Great staff!"
4,"I've known this place for years, since when it first opened, then with the expansion, and to me it represents something beyond great food, beyond incredible success.  It is simply a brilliant operation.  If you order a durum doener for take out, and stand by the kitchen counter, it is like watching the movements of a Swiss watch - - but no watch part ever handed you one of the best doeners anywhere (superb balance of toothy vegetables, onion, and meat) with such a warm smile, and such care.  The in-house meals are superb value - - such a great spread of wonderful substances and delicious flavors.   The semi-outrageous colors, the constant bustle, the thoughtfulness and graciousness of the extremely busy staff - - it's no wonder that even after the expansion, this place is packed no matter when you go (mostly with Turks in the know).   Incredibly handy location right next to Altona Bhf.  It is one of a kind, and it is a kind worth enjoying often."
3,"The fried spring rolls had crispy perforated wrappers and a solid meat and vegetable filling. The sweet Thai chili sauce accompanying it was straight out of the bottle, but tasted better when tweaked with the house pickled chili and garlic on the table. The Summer rolls were tight and served sushi style. The peanut sauce that came with it was good.The Pho Bo (beef) broth was actually really good. Noodle texture and thin sliced beef were all excellent. And the shredded herbs added a balance and interest to the flavors. The fried dough stick was a lovely authentic homage to how Pho is served in Vietnam, and a fun dipping companion for the broth.Caphe s'ua da (iced coffee) was fragrant, espresso strong and served unmixed so you can see the seductive dark brown hue. But evaporated milk was used--refined, but I much prefer the sweetened condensed milk versions."
0,"Service was from a young man who couldn't speak any German and who's English was very difficult to understand. Jumbo plate was good, obviously basic but what was expected.Red blue and white burger was gross. Way too much blue cheese - unbalanced flavors. Soggy buns. The patty was sub-par as well. Have had a lot of blue cheese burgers in the last year so I know a gross burger when I taste it.Macaroni and cheese tasted artificial and was too strong.To sum it up: the food at Hard Rock Cafe is dated. The times have changed and both the rest of the world and Germany have gotten very good at food and flavor. Hard rock cafes food no longer has that extra something - it has been overtaken by amazing alternatives!"
4,Tasty pho.  it's quite good.  warm atmosphere inside. place gets full during lunch rush. we walked in and got last table at 11:30 am on a weekday so get there early.  I will definitely come again to try other menu items.
3,"This place was great. In the lovely Portuguese quarter. The pizza we had was delicious, and the service was nice."
1,"OK, there is definately better sushi in this world than this place. I used to go to the Sushi Circle in Frankfurt, where there wasn't an all-you-can-eat option, and the cuts of fish were better and the selection significantly better. Very long waiting times when the all-you-can-eat special is on offer and as already written, extremely tight seating. I believe if you want to save money, the place to go, but do you really want to ""save money"" when eating sushi (it's RAW fish)? I rather eat ""Fischstäbchen"" from the microwave and save up cash for a really good sushi restaurant once in a while."
4,"I get free coffee at work so have yet to taste it here. On a food level however, they have a great selection on salad/pasta pots, baguettes, bagels etc, as well as brownies, flapjacks and such. Good service and friendly staff."
2,"This review is for the Tattoo Exhibit only. Went to the museum today excited to see what would be portrayed about Tattoo history etc. Basically, it was a lot of photographs of modern day tattoo wearers talking about their tattoos. A few old machines in a display box, a ton of tattoo books on a table, and displayed pigments.  The exhibit seemed super touristy in a sense that it was very basic, and maybe curated by someone fascinated by the culture, and not actually a part of it.I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the historic Skin Samples on display. That saved the exhibit. Everything else you can see in the same fashion on the internet. Pictures of pictures etc."
2,"Beach clubs as beach clubs go, just stopped in for an after-work gig and it was relatively empty. Filled up quite fast though. Decent selection of grill stuff, booze and lots of seating actually not in the sand. Sweet location, nice that it's in the neighborhood and don't have to trek all the way down to the river to hit up a Strandbar."
0,"I'm a native Californian.  I know Mexican food well. Sometimes I like it authentic. Sometimes I like it Americanized.  Being a native Californian it is likely I will eat Mexican food or a Mexican-inspired dish for at least one meal a day.  Which is why when I travel I find myself in Mexican restaurants in places like Germany or Scotland. I usually approach these places knowing that they will be pale comparisons to what I can get back home.  And it was with that in mind that I went to Jim Burrito. So when I say it was literally the worst burrito I've ever had, keep in mind that I wasn't expecting it to be as good as something from back home. What was so bad?  I got the Poblano covered burrito. The sauce tasted like dish soap. It was awful. The burrito's fillings were also very wet and lacking flavor. So basically I had a soupy soapy burrito.  The German friend I had with me tried a bite of my burrito after I refused to eat any more, and he also said it was awful.  As I looked around the place I noticed most people ordered the quesadillas. I'm sure that this much simpler recipe of cheese and a tortilla would have been a better choice, and should you find yourself dragged here by German friends, I recommend you keep it simple and order that.I think the most aggravating part of the meal though came when we went to pay.  We brought our dishes back to the counter, and in German the server/host treated us like we had offended him by not eating the awful burrito.  It was bad enough I had to pay for something inedible, but to be treated like we had offended them by not forcing ourselves to eat the awful meal, well that's just ridiculous.  I didn't make a scene, I didn't request the burrito be taken off the bill, instead I vowed silently to myself I'd write this review to warn other travelers away from this place."
3,"Initially we wanted to check out the Hasselwander but saw that it was closed. Maybe they are on holiday? Anyways, still looking for dinner, about a block down, we saw that there was a vietnamese restaurant. We hopped in for dinner during a weekday and the place was not crowded so we were seated immediately. We started with some drinks and fresh spring rolls for our starter. For our entrees, I had the chicken pho and Matt had I think the beef pho.For our starter, the springs were pretty good. They were fresh and it came with the standard dipping sauce of hoi sin sauce with a little bit of sriracha.For my entree, the chicken pho was great. I'm so used to getting a side of jalapenos and drowning this in fish sauce with salt and pepper and eating this along with my pho but I didn't get this here and my german was not good enough to ask for the complicated sides. But my entree was still tasty. They did give me a regular spoon and chopsticks to eat my pho and I would have liked a soup spoon and the hoi sin sauce and sriracha sauce on the table.It's still a solid place to get your pho fix and I'll definitely will be back when I am crazing pho in the neighborhood!"
3,"Great location, nice ambience, friendly staff with unbeatable price. Will definitely come back!"
3,"Always busy, order and take a buzzer back to your table and wait 5 minutes. Collect your own utensils. No table service. The food is pretty good and for 6 Euros, a good deal. You could do a lot worse in the area.."
4,"I should have come sooner, this place is everything I want in a coffeeshop! When I stopped off on a Saturday morning, I got a perfect V60 pour over coffee and some delicious eggs on toast. The atmosphere is warm and inviting inside, plenty of wood, with a nice view of the Hamburg canals. There is a large upstairs area with plenty of seating, if you want to stay for awhile.While they offer several different ways to make your coffee, don't be overwhelmed and talk with the staff about what you like, they are really friendly. They have a variety of beans, so you can definitely try a few combos and taste many different things. They do their roasting and sell their beans too, if you want to take things home. I can tell, I will be coming back here regulary!"
1,I was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Food was not better than normal Imbiss but more expensive. I won't come back again.
4,Best Dim Sum in HamburgDo not be scared of when having to go in basement. here the food is amazingEnjoy
3,"Trude has a very nice location, next to the museum of labor. It is still very close to the Barmbek Station. The staff is very nice and the drinks are good. I didn't try the food, but the menu has a variety of dishes. On the menu there are different explanations/options for the name ""TRUDE"".The entrance is even with the ground."
2,"Pony Bar is probably the undisputed No.1 bar in the Univiertel - which means that this is the place for you if you like a hip crowd, shabby chic and reasonably priced drinks. I went there for breakfast, which (I guess/hope) isn't exactly their speciality. The trouble started when it became clear that rolls would only be available 45 minutes after opening - on a Sunday. Service never fully recovered after that bad start and orders took their dear time to arrive. The rolls, once they arrived, were of mediocre quality, which should probably be expected given the rather low prices. Espresso, on the other hand, was excellent when the one waitress prepared it. Her colleague's effort some while later wasn't that nice. My advice would therefore be to go there for afternoon coffee or a drink at night, but not necessarily to make a detour for the breakfast. Unless you're a coffee fetishist, got a lot of spare time and are on a budget, that is."
2,"The Omas Breakfast comes with a lot of cheese (some a little weird and others like the brie a very welcome sight on my plate.)Bread rolls, Meat, Croissants, fruit, juice, a bevvy of spreads and a flute of champers also accompany the breakfast.Plenty of food but a little heavy on the stomach and no good if your not a fan of cheese and bread for breakfast.Was a little disappointed with my boiled egg being boiled much too hard... but other then that the service was quick and the price good."
4,"Amazing Italian food.  If you go, you must try the fresh tagliatelle mixed in a Parmesan wheel with white truffles.  Absolutely divine!Make reservations and go early...as they run out of dishes (especially fish dishes) around 8-9PM.Honestly, you have to love a restaurant that buys their main ingredients fresh every morning and sells out at some point in the night.   You know you are getting the best possible ingredients you can get.You must try at least once!"
4,"Awesome, simply incredible food. Great atmosphere, great prices, four people, 2 starters, main dish dessert and lots of wine for 100 euro. Respect. We had the baked avocado with goat cheese and honey, luftgetrocknetes Rindfleisch ('carpaccio for People who don't like RAW meat')..Tortellini alla Panna - best ever. Tagliatelle with beef tips - best beef I have had in Hamburg, full stop. Pizza panna - those fenchelwurst! Awesome. Schweinemedallions in gorgonzola - rich creamy deliciousness. Just freaking go. Now."
3,The restaurant wears a pleasant atmosphere with nice aroma everywhere. I had pasta which i think was the best i had till date.
1,"In 20 years visiting Block House restaurants I have never had such a bad experience. It was so crowded, with a long line at the entrance, and you could feel the stress in the restaurant. Not enough service personal, food came slow, nobody came to check on us after we received our ordered dishes. The food was ok, but nothing super delicious. The children's dish (pasta with tomatoe sauce) was about the size of a table spoon. After we enquired about the size we were told there would be another serving. That never arrived. An ordered glass of wine only came after two additional requests. For the check we waited about 20 minutes without luck, and only when we left the table, and approached the front desk we were ""allowed"" to pay. Shame on Block House for such a bad performance. Might have to find a new favorite restaurant."
2,Nice Café Bar serving tasty green tea and some fresh selected kind of homemade pies. They were playing cool Music that made a charming atmosphere to our conversation. Quite affordable and almost a standard around the corner. During the Summer the garden is a blast in a students district like that. But somehow the waitress wasn't friendly... WTF ? I will be there again for a beer very soon.
3,"If you are looking for a nice little Italian restaurant in hamburg then you should go there. They serve a really good pizza and also the pasta is good. The atmosphere is quite nice if you don't look at all the Italian kitsch around you. It's very small, so be there on time or reserve a table."
4,"This place saved our lives after a train from Denmark arrived an hour ahead of schedule. Super friendly staff even at 6 in the morning. Wonderful sandwiches and amazing sweet potato soup with a ginger twist. Oh, and did I mention? Incredibly cheap, 10/10 would come again!"
2,burger relatively dry. no even real burger bread. side order of wedges was a total joke.
3,"Considering it was a miserable, rainy day with high windgusts -- This was still a gorgeous area to dine. It would have been nicer on the terrace, but the interior is very modern and nice.I couldn't forget the Sweet Curry Coconut Chicken Wok (Chicken, Mango/Coconut Curry, Tomatoes, Grapes)  if I wanted to. It was decently priced and extremely tasty. I was suprised and very pleased."
4,"Cozy interior, outdoor seating, very nice staff and relaxed atmosphere. And most importantly - delicious food!! We've tried 4 different dishes so far and they were all really high quality and very well made!"
3,Super Restaurant wenn man in Feierlaune ist. Leider ist das Personal immer etwas unterbesetzt und es kann teilweise lange dauern bis das Essen kommt. Die Trüffelpasta ist der Hammer! Und Lillo als guter Gastgeber reist alles wieder raus.
4,Very great cafe. Its such a nice crew there. It's the place to go. Food an drinks are cheap and great at the same time.
4,Geile Location - super Essen! Ich habe noch nie so ein perfektes Rinderfilet mit Scampis (Surf & Turf) gegessen!    Extremst empfehlenswert!
4,"Given the price and the fact that literally nothing on the menu exceeds 7 EUR, it's an awesome place to have lunch. It offers not only must-have Turkish options but also some less common dishes. Everything is super yummy and the service is prompt.  The downside is that the line is usually long and they are open only Mon-Fri around lunchtime."
3,"What a strange experience this place was. It's a bar trying to be a dive in one of the richest parts of Hamburg. Weird mix of people: on one hand, the grungy rocker types and at the same time, young yuppies, wearing the standing collars and Burberry scarves. Really odd but at the same time amusing. The staff think they are tougher than they are working in a place like this but it fits the goal of the bar. Really tight quarters when it fills up but the vibe is good. If in the area though, a good place to grab a drink and have a couple laughs. You'll definitely not regret it even if this isn't your thing."
1,"I'm mean really guys- 4 beers two burgers and some Nachos = €75 or something - really...?Burger were OK - Buns were a disgrace , Nachos - Good!- Staff had to be reminded three times of the empty beer glasses and a new order  !-but they were friendly!I'm travelling world wide - always end up in some hard rock cafe, since all the folks find it sooo cool - LAME!Hey, they played German Electro beats at the Hardrock cafe Hamburg - That has NOTHING to do with Hard Rock - play Rock - or actually Hard Rock, hence the name-Only tourists - not one person from HH in there.Just a big corporation trying to sell some shirts for € 20-40 a pop- Nothing to see here , move on!"
3,"This place is a standout for us and almost comfort food when we are in town.  This location is near the University and has diverse clientele. The bathrooms are clean and most of the staff speak English to some degree. Additionally, there are two possibilities for ordering: the normal sit down meal with cloth napkins on one side or the takeout/less posh tables on the side with the corner door.  We usually opt for the latter option unless it is a special occasion as it is 15-25% cheaper. Great place for a date or an informal business dinner. WELL behaved puppies are welcome as long as they sit under the table. The food is great and they have a Pakistani twist on some of you favorite ""Indian"" dishes."
3,At the La Piazzetta we got good pizza. I ordered some take away as well. The staff was very nice and the food was good. On top of the pizza we had some pasta and salad as well. The interior is cozy and decorated with Italian themed and soccer themed photos. Enjoy
3,This restaurant/bar is right at the end of the Reeperbahn. Its large and had some interesting interior decorations. Definitely worth looking into it.The food was yummy and the beer was tasty. Thats what we needed after a long walk through hamburg. Thanks guys.
4,"This place is a find! Mirco Gattardo and his wife Anja greet you and display their menu on a big chalkboard brought to your table. Creative cooking, fine service, reasonable prices. Wines from Salice, in southwest Italy. We loved Trattoria Salento so much we went there three nights in a row! Highly recommend."
4,"I LOVED this place. But go early, because it gets packed and can be pretty hot and uncomfortable to get around in the tight spaces with all the things to see. Love how magical it is when the lights change from Day to Night and you can see the towns/ cities light up. You can spend quite a few hours here taking everything in, so plan accordingly. Wear comfy shoes and again, go early!!"
0,"Consistently embarrassingly poor service. Definitely not recommended. Food was very good, but the servers/staff were so incredibly bad. It wasn't even worth it. I can forgive rushed service, but running around like crazed lunatics and throwing attitude doesn't fly. Very disappointing. Lame. Just plain stupid."
2,Great space; pieces are great including the two Lagerfeld dresses when you enter the museum.  I found an elevator but I don't think it was listed on the map.Restaurant wasn't too bad and the price was great.  The museum store is pretty much what you'd find in any other museum.
1,Very boring food - tasteless pasta and salat that did not seem fresh. But the staff was very energetic and the location on a side street was very nice.
4,Best weekend breakfast in town! Lovely terrace when the weather permits. Great coffee in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
2,"After burgers me and my family took a vote: from 1-5, how many stars. So... 2 votes for 3 stars, 1 for 4, and since I was counting votes I got to be indecisive and go for 3,5 stars. Result is 3 stars. Best things first : meat quality seemed fine. Bun is symbolic, has to be there to give you an illusion of something else than meat overload. I got the classic burger and to me it was a bit heavy on the mustard. But otherwise real greasy like expected. And a s***load of fries. Never seen that many fries on one plate before. Actually kind of scary. A bit too much even.And then the bad: what is up with the acoustics in this place? It fills up pretty quickly after 6pm, and with the people comes the noise. And OMG we had to yell to have a conversation. It was almost impossible to hear what the others at the table said. Its ok with noise, but this was ridiculous. I would go there again if asked, but preferably with more beer and less conversation involved."
1,"The sushi and other plates here aren't at all good tasting. There's a 20 euro ""all you can eat"" deal where you sit at a rotating table and grab dishes. It's not a waste of money (since unlimited food), but I couldn't say I thought any of the dishes had much flavor. The fish is low-quality, the rice is okay, and the presentation is kinda sloppy. There's not great sushi in Hamburg, but there's definitely way better sushi than here."
4,"Ein super tolles Event, kann ich nur empfehlen!! macht spaß und man lernt sich besser im dunkeln zu verständigen."
4,"Not often does one feels ""OMG! This is so much food (also tasty ;)) for such less money!"" It happened to me and my friend last night. The food was only more than sufficient for the two of us (we eat a lot, trust me!). It was spicy enough, tasty and appetizing. The service was okay and the ambience was decent. The place might not be romantic but you'd definitely want to romance the food they serve ;) I would definitely go there again and recommend it to any food lover, who loves spicy food :)"
2,"Der typische Grieche um die Ecke, gut wenn man gerade hungrig aus der U-Bahn stolpert, das Essen ist gut, Service freundlich, trotzdem nur drei Sterne da ich die Preise als zu hoch empfinde und mich die Raucher-Liga, die ständig den Eingang blockiert und einem in's Ohr grölt, mir echt auf den Senkel geht. Sogar, wenn ich gar nicht zum Essen dort bin, sondern nur auf dem Weg von der Bahn dort vorbeimuß.Aus dem Grunde würde ich mich auch ums verrecken nicht im Sommer draußen hinsetzen wollen. Da hat das Ganze eher das feeling der Altherrenkneipe umme Egge. Nicht mein Ding."
3,"This is a very hip bar not far from Hamburg uni. The lighting is spot on, the venue is cleverly designed and has comfy seating arrangements and a great bar to sit at. The Barstaff are knowlageble and friendly and they have a 5 euro cocktail menu...the Cosmopolitains being so scrummy I wish I had of had time to order another one.There's table football and a DJ box with a Live DJ playing music that sets the tone but isn't too overpowering on your conversation. Located right near the cinema this is a great place to pop in pre film or afterwards. Bonus points for the decor, it's adorable....feel like going back though wiht a gold metalic marker next time and drawing a horn on all the little gold ponies painted on the wall as then it would be a unicorn bar wouldn't it?"

Indeed while u're visiting the zoo, u could bump into peacoaks, pelicans or goats and other cute animals. There are a lot of cute puppies that borned in zoo. This zoo has a secret..  At the entrance there a stand where some people give u a bag of vegetables. Here it's allowed visitors to tAke care of animals (surely vegeterian ones) and feed them. To take an example, u could touch elephants and give them beetroot! They love it!!"
4,"Did anyone say ""Hamburgs best pizza""?? They might have said that. I wouldn't know if they were right, cause this is the only Pizza place I'be been to in Hamburg. But one thing Im sure of: They make damn fine pizza at Pizza Bande!Its a very nice place, made me want to linger for longer, just to take in the atmosphere. But loads of people want to eat here - so we ate, and left. Judging by the number of people outside, waiting for a place to sit, I'd say that the Hamburg people love this place to. So it might just be the best damn pizza they have. I kinda even wish I could have one now ... mmmm. And one tip: Go for their specials, you might think the combinations are odd. But they are good!"
4,"I've been to this place when I visited Germany.I've tried couple of other Indian restaurants but shikara is no match with those..I loved the food here, it's fresh and tasty, ambience is great and service is excellent Feel free to ask chef or manager about the daily specials or what suits your taste."
4,"Very good restaurant, a little price for a tasty food. Ask their noodles if you don't have too much ideas."
3,"The one and only place at Hamburg to celebrate Wiener Schnitzel. But, be aware : this place is still well known. So make a reservation!"
3,"Another pizza success! Came to Al Volo for a lovely Saturday lunch. We arrived right at opening time so there was only one other table occupied. The interior looked nice and new. We sat at one of the tall tables with stools. I ordered the Margherita while the Mr. ordered pizza salame. The dough was thin and chewy, just how I like it. The toppings were also very tasty; the salame had quite a bit of a kick! The size of the pizza was just enough--not too much, not to little. We washed it down with some wine. The location of the restaurant is in a nice area, so great way to have some good pizza and go for a stroll afterwards."
3,"After having Dulf's Burgers recommended to me last week by a Friend, to whom it was recommended by many others, we had to check it out ourselves. The Place was so full, it was hard to get a place, but that only matched what we had been told. The best thing about the food is, that most, if not all, ingredients are sourced locally. But local food is nothing without any taste. Luckily, Dulf's Burgers are awesome! You can literally taste the attention to detail that goes into every Burger. And the prices are fair as well. I will definitely return when I am back in Hamburg again."
3,Been here twice and the fish was great. Very fresh. Great view of the River Elbe. Service was good and prices reasonable.
3,Fantastic spot for crepes. Very authentically French. Was here twice during my visit to Hamburg and always had a great experience. The menu offers many different options from traditional dishes to more modern ones. Great selection of desserts too. There's a store and a great outside area next to a canal. A must in Hamburg.
2,"A nice atmosphere, with running sushi, was kinda full, but still good sushi."
3,Had a very good steak here. Argentinian rump steak done perfectly.
4,"First bar I went to in Hamburg and don't need to go anywhere else. It's amazing. I did my washing, drank weird Germen shots and was so drunk I had to be escorted home."
4,"After a wonderful Hamburg harbor tour, we found our way to the Fairmont Hotel-recommended Clouds for the view, drinks and some food. It was sunny but cool and windy and our group of 7 found the top floor outdoor bar not right for us so we went down one floor to the inside bar/restaurant. We were told that area wasn't open for another 2 hours but we stayed to take in the great view and plan our next moves. When I approached the bartender (Dougie sp?) to discuss our options, he quickly provided menus for drinks and food, not at other places, but at Clouds. I finally got it that it was fine to stay and he was incredible with prompt beers, two bottles of wine, snacks and food. He even provided a complimentary strawberry champagne drink and nachos. He made our afternoon even more delightful and was another wonderful example of the welcoming attitude of the great people of Hamburg. Don't miss enjoying Clouds! What a great bartender and an employee of Clouds. Thanks!"
2,"Marsbar - for that little taste of Munich and Düsseldorf right in the west of Hamburg! I went there with a mate due to the simple fact that he likes the wine by the glass there. I hadn't visited the place before, because I know it's a favourite hangout of the Eppendorf Glitterati and hence doesn't exactly suit me down to the ground. Yet that evening at Marsbar turned out to be much more interesting than what I'd bargained for But first things first: the vain bodybuilder-cum-waiter is in place, as is an abundance of the cashmere-clad wealthy. It can get rather crowded, even though Falkenried isn't exactly the cosiest of places - but to see and be seen is apparently of much greater importance than an inviting atmosphere to many. As it got dark, things got a lot more interesting: there was the loud, aging gold-digger (-turned-wife?), whose favourite pastime seems to be shouting names in her loudest voice, especially when she sees a rather well-known German TV chef sitting at the other end of the terrace. After a few more people's names she changed her approach and screamed the names of some holiday resorts. Needless to say, her voice was of the shrill kind and hard to overhear. Yet Madmoiselle Namedropper wasn't the lady that left the biggest impression. That honour must go to a 40-something, sitting together with a bunch of obviously well-off friends, having a glass of wine. So far, so unimpressive - if it wasn't for the fact that she was obviously at her 15th glas and pissed senselessly. At first I thought it was some kind of candid camera comedy performance, but any sense of fun was lost when she, still sitting on her chair, fell to the side, not moving for a few seconds. One could hear a needle drop for a few moments, until a waiter (not Jean-Claude van Damme's bigger brother, but another, friendlier one) came to her rescue. And this was when I really couldn't believe my own eyes: not only couldn't her friends be arsed to help her, they also didn't feel bothered to take her home and to bed, preferring to stay until last orders instead. While Ms Boozer was still babbling and swaying relentlessly. I guess the Eppendorf Glitterati have their own etiquette It may be unfair that this grotesque evening will forever dominate my impression of Marsbar, but a bar is very much defined by its costumers. And, based on this visit, I have to say they're a strange lot. Apart from that I can commend their Ginger Ale (served with ice and a slice of orange!) and mint tea - the drinks selection in general seems to be decent, tough not exactly cheap. So go there if you consider yourself part of the upper class hoi polloi or if you have a penchant for the weirdly embarrassing. Just know what you can expect."
3,"Potato everything, even menus shaped like smiling potatoes. Food was pretty good, standard German fare. Portions generous and prices quite reasonable. One of the more expensive entrees plus a beer cost under 20 euros. Dark and cosy ambience (Keller means cellar, so most of the restaurant is, you guessed it, in a cellar.)"
4,Great little place! Could easily compete with high end burger places in the US. The owner was super nice as well. The doctor had a Banksy style to it. Go here if you are craving a quality modern burger.
0,"DIRTY place! Both me and my friend found medium length human hair in our dishes, and we even had different dishes. When we told the staff, they were really cold and didn't apologize to both of us, just my friend. Also, when we were leaving, they sort of ignored us and didn't even say goodbye. Basically, they made us feel guilty for their own mistake and it felt like they just wanted us to leave asap. The little food we ate was average, and even if we hadn't found the hairs, I doubt we would have ever gone  back there. Avoid !"
2,"First to make things clear, I am not a student nor on a budget. I've also had the benefit of eating steak in some of the best places in and outside of Germany hence my hurdle for quality meat is quite high. Hopi, located so close to my home, is unfortunately a disappointment. Having moved here recently I was looking for the occasion to try this place out. From the reviews here I was expecting to be wow'ed. Well, didn't quite happen. This is an older place and the interior is going downhill. Nicely maintained yet aging in terms of design. Even Block House with it's old school flair seems a bit more modern. Not a big deal though. This is a very subjective issue. Unfortunately where things went wrong for me was with the food. I had the ribeye steak. Prepared and served just like at Block House with the salad and garlic bread. The meat was horrible. I ordered it medium rare and it was gummy and bland. This was not good meat and if it were prepared by a gourmet chef would probably still not taste well. The garlic bread was ok but on the dry side. The salad very simple and the dressing forgettable. Don't get me wrong. For the cheap prices here, it's a good way to get your steak on. Once you've finished studying or received your first paycheck, it's time to move on. Yes, Block House is more expensive but the meat is consistent. Butchers, Meatery or the place in Afrikahaus are all better.On a side note, our waitress was super nice. We had the lady with the short, blonde hair and she really was a sweetheart. Unfortunately, the old guy (who I presume was the owner) was in the middle of a heated fight with the Asian lady at the end of the night. We were the last guests and these two really went at, insulting each other loud enough that we had ringside seats. We were amused but it didn't do much to lure us back in the future. ""Professional"" is defined otherwise."
2,"I know we have the French Laundry in California and are terribly spoiled, but the food at this restaurant was a 4.  The service started out great and deteriorated to unacceptable over the evening, so I would put that at a 3.  When they served one of our party the wrong dessert, instead of apologizing and offering to serve the correct dessert, she said ""the other dessert is basically the same, just black currant vs strawberry.""  what the heck?!  we said, that was fine, that they could make up the mistake on our petit fors that we were getting to go (because we were too full).  They gave us the petit fors to go, but did not include anything extra.  We paid for accompany wine and no dessert wine was served.  They did not offer coffee or any other options at the end of the meal.  We have received expected service at other restaurants in Germany, so I don't understand.  $511 euros for a dinner should get exceptional service.  Boo to the Haerlin!"
4,"Excellent little quiet bar, great beers, friendly staff, food looked very good, though we didn't eat here ourselves"
3,"What a cool spot! Located right in the middle of bustling Schanze in Hamburg, this Currywurst and fries joint has a legit vibe going on. The food is really nice, so are the fries.Hip clientele and friendly staff. Really a no fuss no frills place, not fancy but so good. Apparently some guests did not have the best experience but I do not understand why. When it comes to this food, many place are bad, but this one had a high quality.Prices are also good, would recommend."
4,Look on yelp to find restaurant near hotel crown plaza this was beyond my expectations service food presentation all 5 stars  the  hostess was so nice spoke English perfect (which I had hard x finding people who spoke English in Hamburg) husband and wife team !!!she hostess he chef great team We ate they 2 of the 3 days we were in Hamburg this is the kind of place that I hope to find in big city so if u r in Hamburg try it I know u will not be disappointed I had fish sea bass so so goodAlso dorado best in long x serve  with vegetable & salad Husband have schnitzel both night one pork one veal fried potatoes  and salad happy manAnd the price for a perfect meal was very reasonable
4,"Had a veggie burger with two IPA beers, and sweet potato fries. It was excellent. The service was fast and the waiters friendly. The seating was outside and it  was relatively quiet. Excellent place."
3,"Very nice authentic Mexican restaurant. Good food, and pleasant service. Our waiter didn't know anything about the food or about drinks but he always had a smile on his face which made everything great. Would go here again"
2,"A Falafel place that is a bit more spacious so you actually enjoy sitting down and a bit cleaner than your average 'orient bistro'.Food quality is perfectly fine, flavours could much improve if they toasted the wraps / breads."
4,This place is amazing! Delicious German cuisine. We had the Spätzel with meatloaf and the Maultaschen with egg. We are going back on Sunday before we return to Copenhagen.
3,"Another fabulous beach bar in Hamburg!Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and lots of tropical kitsch!This has more recliners than most other bars, unfortunately it also fills up quite quickly. The drinks at Del Mar are great, you have fantastic views over the harbour and can just sit back and relax and watch the ships go by. If you've never been to a beach bar or just need to relax after a long day, check out this spot!"
3,"Hubby took me here for my birthday. Our reservation had requested a seat by the window so we can enjoy the view but we were seated at a table next to a table by the window; we asked if we could take the empty one by the window but were told the table was reserved. It actually remained empty the whole time we were there, so that was a disappointment.We ordered the Chateaubriand for two which comes with a total of four sides and two sauces, so we got the asparagus, broccoli, roasted veggies and truffle fries. As you can see we tried to even out the meat with all the veggies. For the sauce we got the truffle and lobster - both were rich and full of flavor, but we both liked the truffle one best. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and was flavorful and tender. The sort-of table side service (since the steak is cut in the dining room but at a special station vs next to your table) made it seem quite fancy. For dessert we got the coconut sorbet sans ""Happy Birthday"" message despite hubby making the request with our reservation. Except for the restaurant seemingly not reading the special request in our reservation, this was a nice indulgent night out. The food was good and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, and the view is hard to beat."
4,"Luigis is, BY FAR, the best Italian food I've had anywhere in Germany.  The pizza is wood fired and huge...fresh ingredients and superb.  The pasta bolognese was outstanding as well...noodles were perfectly al dente.  I don't ever give five stars...this would have been six stars."
4,"It is difficult when you traveling to Europe for business trip-this place is very, very good and so perfect."
3,"This is sort of place I would come to a lot if I wasn't married with two children and had a highly stressful job that took up all of my time. Or in my 40s. So, the format is like being in your coolest friends apartment, complete with sofas, pool table, cracking tunes, and an open basement with dancefloor and various industrial remnants of it's time as a DildoFabrik (yes it's an easy translation) . It's also one street from the main Reeperbahn, not hugely far from St Pauli / Millerntor / all the fun of the fair. So perfectly located for good times and a friendly bohemian crowd. Very popular with the Qype Kids, and the venue for our excellent 2011 Xmas (Q)iez party."
3,"Really like this place - nice coffee, alternative folks, loungy music.Need a location to celebrate? You can even rent the Bacana for private parties, the owner is definitely a laid back dude. Just be sure you organize a few things yourself, if you need a DJ or anything ;)The Bacana is nice for breakfast and coffee during day, but also a cosy location to hang out later. Contra (to me): sometimes the guys smoke, which you can smell the next day while wanting to have breakfast"
4,"Stopped by for a quick takeout order today. Super friendly, polite, and clean place. I ordered the dürum and as always it was tasty. Definitely recommend this spot for lunch."
4,"The staff don't speak English, and this place gets hopping with good business. Yet, the servers are kind, gracious and patient.Outstanding lentil soup with bread and great value for money at 4.5euro. A solid lunch. But the mixed grill was delectable and showcased what this place is about--grilled lamb, kebab, kofta and chicken with rice and couscous.Open until 06:00h, cash only."
3,"Get a hamburger in Hamburg (the origin city of the hamburger). This was a major priority in my plan when visiting this city. After passing by some other Yelp recommendations, I finally decided to take the train out here before checking out the St. Pauli Christmas Market nearby. It's about a 5-7 minute walk from the train stop.Arriving in the evening, the place was packed. As in, every single seat was taken. I tried to seat myself at the bar, only to be informed that I still had to put my name down because there were slots of reservations. No biggie. I was fine waiting. Except it seemed like I waited for half an hour or more as I watched groups of people walk in and get seated without reservations. Turns out the hostess thought I was also waiting for a dining companion to arrive thus the multiple snubs. Well, that tells you something about going out to eat by yourself at restaurants here. Rare stuff.Anyway, I finally got to sit at the bar and already having familiarized myself with the menu--there is an awesome disclaimer on the front page about what to expect with their food and how to eat it--I ordered a burger, fries, and beer. It was a hefty portion and the interestingly English-muffin-like bun was tiny compared to the patty, but a decent American-esque meal. Service was fine. Given the crowds, the popularity of The Bird speaks for itself. It's a good place to eat some good food and for the locals to get a taste of the stateside stuff. Seemed like a very social scene in there. The most important tip I will offer you is this: CASH ONLY."
4,"Amazing museum, great collection !There are so many details, like lights from the interior of trains. I loved the day/night scenography, it is a brilliant idea !I think I just fell in love with this museum !"
4,"Probably one of the most unique things you'll see in your life. Worth seeing! The airport section is just incredible! Perfect for anyone: family, couple, friends."
4,"As a third wave coffee shop lover, I believe this is also one the bests in Hamburg. In ""Portugiesenviertel"" area of Hamburg-which is full with tourists and tourist traps, this is certainly the best coffee place.The coffee quality and how it's prepared is exactly how I like. I do ask what kind of coffee I'm getting (prefer to be surprised but I think you can choose it too). And I get proper answers proving me that they know what they're doing. It's a calm place where you can make a pause ""in silence"" and read your stuff -inside or if it's sunny outside- and taste a good flatwhite with micro foam. The atmosphere seems just a bit cold and reminding me Scandinavian style minimalistic places (I lived in Stockholm). I think it was a dairy store before and they haven't even changed the facade, I enjoy it. The service at the bar is also kind, another reason which makes me go back there again and again. But first reason is the tasty bitter fresh coffee-"
1,"I really wanted to love this place simply because it's vegan and even brought (4!) non-veg friends to try it out but it was disappointing. They were out of almost everything so we went with mediocre veggie patties on dry buns and ok sauce with no table service and overpriced (tiny!) bottles of fritz colas. There are definitely better vegan/veggie burgers to be had in Hamburg, even just a couple blocks away."
3,"Authentic California-Mexican. Do not come here expecting mexican taqueria style tacos and burritos. Come here for something close to Chipotle or El Torito. However, considering the international food scene in Hamburg, the food here is quite good. I recommend the Beef Ranchera and Carnitas. Their Beef Ranchera is obviously stewed and not grilled (like real asada ranchera), but it's still quite tasty. Carnitas flavorful and not too dry. Wish they had corn tortillas for tacos."
3,"Very pleasant deli cum bistro overlooking the new concert hall in Hafencity. When building is complete, this will be a great location. Right now, as with many of the places in hafencity you sit partially in the midst of a building site. Not dirty, but certainly noisy. But with tasty salads, expertly cooked pasta (and the not tried but good looking flammkuchen and tartines) this is still a really good lunch spot. And watching Hafencity go up around you is perhaps part of the charm!"
4,"This is my new favorite burger place in Hamburg. It has claimed the number one spot over two other great burger places. Their burgers are a nice size, but don't leave you feeling bloated when you finish. Their fries are perfectly cooked. Their beverages are also great. The service staff is attentive and very quick. All in all I would say this place is a must go. If you love burgers and either love in Hamburg or are planning to visit Hamburg, this is the place for you. We've been here a couple of times, and this place is yet to disappoint. The Mr. T burger isy personal favorite choice. Can't go wrong with that."
2,Decent Italian food. It does what it says on the tin.
2,"From the very beginning, they had us standing out in the cold so they could try to sell pictures of us with axes. Considering the price we shoulda gotten the picture for free... lol It's a lot of acting and narrating in German, so if you don't speak german, a lot goes over your head. But some of the videos have english on the bottom however bring your reading glasses cuz its a bit small. overall i think they should consider english tours considering they have parts of their brochure in english... a lil misleading. so 3 stars only."
3,"Good Italian food for my birthday! Italian restaurant with candlelight ambience. Had awesome tomato and pesto bruschetta. My husband had Italian meat bruschetta and he just loved it. That was our starter. The main courses that we ordered were half vegetariana pizza and half salami pizza plus asparagus cheesy risotto. They were so good. The staff was friendly as well. Overall, had a good tasty dinner!"
3,"Young, fresh, cozy as well as dynamic place.Very good and friendly service.We had poached eggs with avo, pesto, spinach on bread. Delicious!Waffle, other bread and dishes look perfect as well.Coffee (espresso and cappuccino) were excellent.The home made maracuja lemonade was just refreshing WOW!One star reduction, as we wait for 30 minutes (ok, I didn't know before). Reservation online only and no table free the next two weeks.In general perfect for the business. However not for spontaneous brunch people."
3,"Great place, friendly (and cheeky!) waiters, tasteful food served in decent portions. Has all the Chinese classics that Europeans like without taking too much of the authenticity away."
2,I thought this place was fine.  the view is certainly great.  The Pannfisch hamburger style was very nicely done.  but the sous vide salmon was not as successful - seemed odd in texture.  Overall the prices were pretty high so the 'value for money' didn't work for me.
3,"A nice place for a decent dinner that does not kill off your retirement account. The pizza's are thin crust and huge (definitely large enough for two hearty eaters. The salads are also nice, and on a nice summer evening their outdoor seating is very nice. Enjoy!"
2,This place offers a novel way of serving food with meat being carved directly onto your plate by the staff who are constantly passing your table. The meat was well cooked although the sides were average. Overall we found the experience to be unusual yet fun. I would recommend this to people visiting Hamburg.
3,"Very good value with their 'all you can eat' deal. Tasty, not the best in town but fairly good. Went there with my stepson who very kindly invited me. We had white wine which was nice. Nice place, worth it. We'll go back there."
3,"Wanted to come here for some time and finally had a chance to stop in. First off, and most importantly, the coffee is damn good. We had large cappuccinos and both us had some cake. One was a brownie type thing with white cream somehow on top and the other was a double-chocolate mousse type thing. Basically, we were complimenting the coffee the whole time and really enjoyed it. Strong flavored with just the right amount of whipped milk and really well balanced. I'm super anal about coffee and have a top-of-the-line machine at home and buy good coffee which I grind myself. This is the first place in Hamburg where I would say the coffee is comparable or better to what I can make for myself at home. The cake on the other hand was pretty good but not amazing. My brownie thing was a bit too sweet. The chocolate mousse thing was kind of bland. Unfortunately, I found the sizing also on the small side. I don't like when you get a piece of cake that is half a kilo but when it's tiny I feel scammed a bit. The sizing needs to be increased a bit. I also found the crowd a bit odd in terms of it basically being Schanzen yuppies but they're easily zoned out and I liked the room and atmosphere in general. Plus it was sunny and you can sit nicely outside in front of the door. Anyway, do come and try this place out if coffee is your thing."
4,"It's like 5 stars McDonalds. Best meat, wonderful staff and modern enviroment. Best burger in town. I reccomend El Torro, burger in Mexican style."
4,"Came here for a very relaxing Sunday brunch with my man! Their menu changes daily as they use the freshest ingredients so don't be surprised if you can't find a menu!When you first enter, it may look a bit small but head on back past the kitchen where there's more seating and outdoor seating as well. We sat in the back in some comfy chairs. The decor of the place is so charming! Our waitress quickly greeted us and told us the daily specials and her recommendations. She was really nice and attentive! We ended up ordering the breakfast meal for one and added an order of their house made pancakes. I ordered a tea and was pleasantly surprised when the waitress popped out into the garden to pick fresh mint leaves for my tea!We started with a refreshing bowl of yogurt with fresh fruits and musli. Then our breakfast meal came which had everything you'd want for a brunch. There were various cold cuts of meats to choose from, cheese, caprese salad bites, some cucumber slices, olives, grapes, and jams and spreads for everything! We also got a basket of bread and a fresh hard boiled egg. Shortly after, our pancakes arrived and they looked fantastic! There was a bit of fruit jam drizzled on it with fresh mint and a chocolate spread and a maple sauce as accompaniments. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and tasted divine! Super fluffy and not eggy at all. Adding the mounds of the chocolate spread to it also helps with the deliciousness :)All in all, This was probably one of the better brunch experiences we have had this far being here. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are reasonable and the staff is also super friendly. Our brunch only cost us about 20€ so we'll be coming back soon to try more daily specials for sure!"
4,This restaurant is amazing! The ambience is lovely. The food was so delicious!! We were there on a Saturday evening. I chose the vegi menu and it was simply superb! The cook was so kind.  He guaranteed us a gluten free menu for our little son who is a Celiac(Zöliakie). My son loved the food! He didnt have any stomachache afterwards.  The service was good even though we were in a large group and things got a bit confusing. We will definitely go there again.
3,"One of my favorite Schwarma places in Hamburg. It's a little small inside (25-35 ppl) but nice and friendly. The workers are friendly, too. I don't eat other things there so I can't say much about that food, but Schwarmas taste perfect The range of food isn't that big, but definitely enough to choose from.The only thing I don't like that much are the toilets. You have to go behind the counter to go downstairs and the cabinets are really small. All in all nice place to go!"
3,"Durch Qype sind wir auf das Restaurant aufmerksam geworden. Unscheinbar von außen; klein und gemütlich innen. Ich hatte einen Tisch für eine kleine Geburtsfeier gebucht. Schöner, dekorierter Tisch in der Ecke mit Überblick. Herzliches Willkommen durch Frau Teichmann. Das Geburtstagskind wurde mit einem kleinen Küchlein mit Kerze überrascht. Wir bestellten Pannfisch, einfach köstlich. Der empfohlene Wein ein Genuss. Die Nachspeise  eigentlich war kein Platz mehr  war der krönende Abschluß. Das Sagners ist ein Spitzenrestaurant. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Trip nach Hamburg wieder vorbeikommen. Wir wünschen Herrn und Frau Teichmann viele Gäste und weiterhin viel Kreativität."
4,Tucked away just a bit but worth the walk. Friendly staff and stellar pour-over. Will return a number of times before leaving town.
3,Delicious food!!! Not so much vegetarian options but I loved my salad. Also good price. Friendly staff.
3,"Thanks to the fab coffee connoisseurs of Yelp Hamburg--danke Euch nochmal!--, I received some great tips on where to go for my third-wave crave while staying in Hamburg.Public, located in Neustadt, was not too terribly far from our digs near the Hauptbahnhof.  We either took a mildly long walk to Public or a short U-Bahn ride; it was that easy.What initially struck me about Public was its atmosphere.  Relaxed and inviting comes to mind when I think of the set-up.  Public is a cosy yet hip spot with wooden tables and chairs, fresh flowers & wee potted cacti, and soft lighting.  Order at the counter, pay straight away or not, then take a seat.  It's just that easy.  If you've questions about the beans, the type of coffee drink you might wish to try, then do avail yourselves of the worker-owners.  They're putting a lot of 'herzblut' into keeping Public stellar and it shows.  Want to further your java knowledge?  Well, start by checking out the detailed 'coffee map' up on the wall to the right of the counter. -facts and figures galore!On one of my many visits, I spoke to a young man who, upon my telling him where I was from, seemed really receptive to my coffee queries.  Between making drinks he'd pop back 'round to my perch at the window and continue the coffee-chat.  I really enjoyed the interaction.  Chit-chat aside, the bevvies are top-notch.  The pastries are lovely, too.  Visitors and locals alike: a trip to Public is in order!Remember: WWJB?"
1,"Leider nicht so gut. Das Essen lag eher auf dem Niveau des Lieblingsvereins des hier ansässigen Fanclubs  gerade noch zweitklassig. Zum Mittagstisch hatte ich Gyros in Metaxasauce für 6 Euro. Die Menge war in Ordnung, der Geschmack der Sauce ok, wenn auch nicht an Metaxa erinnernd. Das Fleisch war aber kaum genießbar  knorpelig, hart, überwürzt und trocken. Ich hatte den Eindruck, als wäre es vorgegart und wieder aufgewärmt worden."
4,"Probably the best vegetarian restaurant in Hamburg! Went there on recommendation by a local and was not disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious and the menu offers a big variety of creative dishes and drinks. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere nice and cosy. Highly recommendable, even for those who are usually meat eaters. If you're coming with a bigger group or around weekend, making a reservation would be advisable as it's highly frequented."
4,"Awesome vibe, excellent home roasted coffee and super yummy breakfast! Really clean and stylish. The portion size is on the smaller side, so it would be great if they offered large and small portions on their breakfast menu."
4,"Pauli pizza is like an institution in St. Pauli. You get to be creative and do your own pizza.The small basic pizza cost 2EUR50 and the big one 3EUR50.However small is really small, and big is medium size (pizza hut standards) Toppings are between 50c and 1EUR50. Great tasting pizza, that's why it's always busy. So maybe you should pre-order your pizza on the phone then pick it up after 15 minutes, instead of waiting in the really small place, which gets full very quickly!"
4,"Great caïpirinha !!! If you need to refresh yourself, you found the good place. Katze is a nice bar located in Sternchanze and they have friendly waiters that even gave us water for free. They have a Happy Hour while you can have a caïpirinha for only 4,50€. Don't hesitate, they worth it!"
4,"A small piece of jungles in the middle of Planten and Blumen. Exciting, if you are big fan of flora und fauna. Otherwise this place is not really big - two tropical rooms and one filled with cactuses. I was attracted mainly to cactus part of the garden. Basically you can get trough in like 10 min. But its entry free, so if you are in Planten und Blumen you should definitely give this place a try."
4,"A club that looks like a scout hut! A first - but as bad as this concept sounds it's actually pretty good. If I wasn't so damn ill I'd be there tonight. Grüner Jäger means ""Green Hunter"" in German. My good friend in absentia is also a Hunter - so I will take him here when he gets back. The beer is cheap, there are comfy sofas, a big dance floor, regular live music, young crowd, table football upstairs... it's a very decent hangout. Not as stylish as the Sofabar across the road, but more music going on."
4,One of the best doner durums I've eaten. And 3.5 Euro is a good price.
4,"Some of the best, nicest barkeepers I've ever seen.Great selection of American whiskeys, will convert the most ardent scotch lover."
1,"Wir wollten gestern Hotdogs bei Miss Sofie essen  um 12:30 haben wir die Aussage bekommen, dass diese nicht vor 13 Uhr warm sein, wenn die Bedienung jetzt anfangen würde. Das Eis war die letzten Male sehr lecker (dafür die zwei Sterne)  aber bei einem von zwei Besuchen waren von den zwei vorhandenen Softeissorten (Schoko und Vanille) nur eine vorhanden :-(. Und teuer ist es auch noch. Grundsätzlich eine tolle Idee, aber irgendwie hapert es noch an der Umsetzung."
3,"I've come to Burgerlich several times now with coworkers, family and friends. Generally, it's a good experience. There have been a few times where it wasn't so great, i.e. bathrooms not being kept clean, toilet paper strewn about in the upstairs hall and undercooked meatballs served to my child. Although, upon letting someone know, it was quickly taken care of.The ability to order via the tablet apps makes for a speedy food delivery to your table. I love the chili burger but I find that the meals are quite pricey in comparison to other burger locations nearby. Envious of the recipe for the chili mayo, it's so delicious!!!Highly recommend trying the homemade drinks. My personal go-to is the Basilikum Lemonade."
0,"Don't expect to get customer service. If you're lucky enough to get customer service, the coffee is great, but we're leaving now after 20 minutes of waiting. Even though the waiter has cleaned the table, he didn't ask what we'd like to drink. Also waving at the other waitress didn't help. So, thanks for nothing. See you never."
2,Good cocktails. good food. happy hour. service could be better.
4,"Ich kenne den Laden bestimmt schon seit 25 Jahren, mit meinem Mann bin ich zum Stammkunden geworden, als wir in der Nähe wohnten. Leider ist das nicht mehr der Fall, aber zu bestimmten Gelegenheiten ist ein dinner im 'la Pergola' zur Tradition für und geworden.Großartig die fluffigen weichen Brötchen mit Basilikumpesto, die als Gruß aus der Küche kommen. Man muß aufpassen, daß man sich daran nicht schon satt isst.Ansonsten: toller Service, leckeres Essen, moderate Preise, kuschelige Atmoshäre, ich persönlich liebe das Lammfilet mit Dijon Senf Sauce, und für uns beide ist die Rindercarpaccio mit reichlich frischen Champignons, Parmesan und Rucola oder das Vitello Tonnato ein Muß.Reservierung ist ratsam, die Plätze am Rand sind gemütlicher als in der Mitte und immer schnell voll."
4,"What a gem this place is.  I walked a solid 2 miles from the S-Bahn to get here, as it's nestled in a Hamburg neighborhood.  It's not a tourist spot.  It was worth the walk.Landhaus Scherrer is an interesting combination of first class and family in its decor and service. The single waiter than handled my room was a gentleman - thoughtful, professional, and capable of a laugh at the sight of a child (a family was dining that night).  The greeting woman seemed quite similar - a bit serious at first, but clearly very kind if you needed help.So the atmosphere was excellent, but the food actually topped it.  This is no neighborhood comfort food.  After picking out an incredibly inexpensive (but good) wine for me, the waiter brought out a complementary plate of variations on a pumpkin theme - ice cream, custard, pumpkin slices, etc, all prepared differently and all wonderful.  After a salad came the crusted duck dish. It was one of the best duck dishes I've ever had - full of flavor and wonderfully prepared.  I also had an excellent desert, but I can't recall it any longer.In sum, Landhaus Scherrer is a real find for a visitor of Hamburg.  I hope it's well-known by the locals.  Regardless, all who visit or live in Hamburg should stop in."
3,"The food is basically very good. Nothing fancy. If you like Vietnamese style dishes this is pretty nice. If you are a fanatic about Vietnamese foods this will probably fall a little short. That said, I would happily return and enjoy a different selection. Nice folks. There is outside seating today (oct 2, 2015---it was a beautiful Friday in Hamburg)"
4,"This is by far the best lamb/chicken/kebab I had. Authentic place with shisha space, live music and delicious food. I recommend the grilled meat for 2/3 to share."
4,"It's a wonderful, quaint little restaurant.  The staff was friendly and helpful with understanding the menu.  My German is nonexistent.  The entrees change weekly and the dish I ordered was full of flavor.  The appetizers were authentic and tasty.  Overall it is a nice place."
4,"Great restaurant! A nice place, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The meal were excellents, the meet soft and tasty, the side dish good but perhaps a little bit too simple, and the price was fully justified (we were even expecting to pay more). I only can recommend this place for people who are looking for a little more sophisticated dinner."
2,"Average little thai place. The prices are decent for the Schanze, but the food is only good, not great. Will I go again? Probably not, I know somewhere in St Pauli that I much prefer, and if I wanted a full restaurant experience, then they're also out of luck, because they're not really a restaurant."
4,"to echo another reviewer: hands down the best falafel in hamburg.it's also, miraculously, the cheapest: €2,50 for a basic wrap, €,50 for each additional ingredient, meaning you can get an enormous, overstuffed, insanely delicious falafel for the same price as a shitty, flavorless one at every other shop. i know which one i'd choose!"
4,"Great variety. Large portions, friendly helpful and knowledgeable staff.Decor is straight forward and simple. Comfy booths are a must. I had a spiced checked burrito with extra jalapeños and loved every bite.Including my Fritz cola and guacamole cost me only €11, so great value too.I'll be back.Maybe even later!"
4,"Great place to sit outside when the weather is nice;  quiet, casual neighborhood vibe.  The flammkuchen here, is the bomb.  So light it practically floats on air; the balance of ingredients is deft, as it has to be with flammkuchen:  enough flavor to enchant, while not overwhelming.  Top drawer."
3,"it is not that easy to find a good brunch place in Hamburg! Glueck & Selig is definately worth going! drinks are a little overpriced if you ask me. dishes are nothing fancy, but very tasty!"
4,"Hard to believe, but Altona and Hamburg were two rivals. Now Altona is part of Hamburg (a nice, charismatic part), but I guess there still was a need to have its own museum. And I must say, well done guys! Small, but very informative museum, revolving around Elbe and everything which comes with it: shipbuilding, whaling(thank God it's in the past), fishery, sea trade, port and so on. A message is clear: the river is a key to regions past and the future. There's a beautiful collection of figureheads occupying the whole room. Also a hall dedicated to Schleswig-Holstein, Helgoland island in particular. This museum is very similar to  surprise Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (Hamburg Museum), but smaller. It has a few things, which its bigger brother doesn't have: the whole interactive section dedicated to kids - Kinderolymp and a restaurant, Vierländer Kater, a house in the house, replicating typical Northen German tavern of 18th century. The restaurant itself worth visiting, great concept!"
3,We had a dinner with 15 colleagues there and they seated us in the nice kind of outside area with a roof. It was a little bit tight for 15 people but it was okay.It took a long time until we got our food but that was probably because the restaurant was packed and we were a lot of people.I got the Pizza Vegetarina with extra Artichokes for around 10 Euro and an alcohol free beer. It was very delicious and it just costed 14 Euro in sum.You get a good but not the best pizza.
2,"The boat was interesting, but I would definitely not do it again. The whole time all I could think was wow this would be bad if there was a fire and did they get these mannequins from the sex stores on the reaperbahn. Honestly the boat itself was very interesting to see, especially to see how small it was for the sailors. It would have been better if they either hadn't added in the mannequins and plastic food or spent the extra money to get realistic ones. It was actually pretty entertaining trying to find all the mannequins though."
3,"In German, 'kekse' sounds like 'cakes' but really means cookies, so when I first walked past the happykappy--a store clearly specializing in cupcakes--well, I just had to try. I'll bet they are really just muffins disguised as cupcakes, I mumbled to The Mexican as we ducked inside. No, no oh no. They where, in fact, the real-deal. Perhaps overly-sweet for the typical German pallet, these babies are pure pastry porn: big on size, taste and a bit on price. But hey, this is not the corner Bäckerei--unless your corner baker is Lewis Carroll. If you never had a cupcake, this is where you go in Hamburg to try one. If your alcoholic friend is throwing a dinner party, a box of cupcakes makes a good backup to the gift of wine. And if your girlfriend is a sex-in-the-city nut: consider the seduction factor of these cupcakes: beautiful, edible fashion."
3,"I tried some of the non-sushi dishes on the menu. There are not that many dishes, but the ones I tried were very tasty and were served pretty quickly as well. The staff was very nice. The decoration is modern and nice. You can definately have a yummy meal at the echtasien even if you are not a Sushi fan."
4,"It's bigger inside than it seems, many white tables, and fully booked at dinnertime. Don't come without a reservation.Food and service are superb here; a confidently limited set of dishes, creative food without going overboard, generous portions, and not too expensive for what you get either. Everything feels pleasantly un-rushed, making this a nice place to dine out with a little time.Same goes for the wines: a very tasteful selection, and all sized and priced so you'll be happy to order more.Nailed it, don't change the concept! :)"
4,"Absolutely love this place!! From the outside it looks a bit run down and you may be even turned off by it but once you step inside you won't regret it. It reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in New York with its dark wood paneling, red tablecloths, and Chinese artwork. The staff is extremely friendly and next to all the artwork you will notice several new clippings with regard to China Golden. That's right, they have been published in newspapers, magazines, and much more. The huge menu has everything you could imagine and more. The prices are a bargain for what you get and what you get is a feast. The smells, the taste, and the atmosphere are to die for. I can't recommend 1 dish since I love them all as if they were my children but just trust me and stop by China Golden and see for yourself."
3,"Suntan o'clock! It really is kind of like being on a real beach, except you've just walked from your house and you can't actually jump in the Elbe, just see it. A relaxed vibe, decent seating/cushions if you get in early, and a nice bar that will even serve Weissbier with a straw - totally tropical. My only gripe would be the amount of cigarette butts in the sand. So no 5th star. Still - something very different and cool to show off to your English friends!"
2,"We wanted to try out the restaurant because the reviews were quiet good. The first impression was good. The atmosphere is good. You can sit outside if you reserve a table in advance.We ordered a starter. A mixed starter plate cost 18€. Even though it is overpriced, it was delicious. For bread you pay an additional 4€. As a main starter we ordered homemade pasta with truffle (28€) and Pasta Aglio with scampis (18€). The homemade pasta with truffle was delicious. But still very overpriced. Pasta Aglio was really disappointing. Tiny four scrimps were added. Winterhude is known for the higher prices. We were very disappointed. I am willing to pay more if the quality and the service is good. This was not the case. We waited 1.5h for the main course. Service was not asking whether we want more drinks or have any other wishes. All in all this place is a overpriced. The service is not great. You need to wait a long time to be served. The dishes are not outstanding."
4,"So good. This is my second trip to Hamburg and my second time here. Came originally because my gf had raved about their lentil soup, and she's right to do so - it's the best. The pide and lahmacun are delicious. And the main dishes are outstanding. Today I had the yogurt kabab and it was great. Chill vibe, friendly staff, good prices, fantastic food."
4,"Unbeatable, this place. you walk in and feel as if you were in Little Italy in New York in the 70s. Wooden decos, tables, original old-fashioned floor and no-English speaking personnel. Well, what the hell. The food is more than gorgeous, even if you have to fight through the linguistic issues. Feels lile Mamma is serving you personnaly, for those who've been in Little Italy at the above mentioned period of time. A must go."
4,Great little place in Hafencity. Great food and great service. Nice place to sit outside on a sunny day with a glass of beer and watch the ships go by. Inside space is very limited.
2,I must admitting it's rare that I come across REALLY good Italian food. And this wasn't one of those rare times. The food wasn't that well prepared. And the pizzas were simply boring - tasting most of all a bit prefabricated.
3,"Nice place to go and get just about everything, and it all tastes good too! Lots of students and a relaxed atmosphereif you can get a table. If it's nice weather, you can enjoy the outdoor seating. Apothecary decorations and friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices and huge selection for good quality, normal food."
4,"Excellente. Had a superb porcini mushroom (Steinpilz) tortellini in a light cream sauce, washed down with a lovely glass of pinot grigio. I rarely order vegetarian meals but this was excellent and one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The restaurant is modern and stylish. The service is friendly and very professional. I was there midweek and didn't need to book a table but I'm sure weekends are very busy. I'd love to go back when have a bigger appetite and have several courses."
4,"I've had mixed grills here and they were very good,  but what sets this place apart (and please don't confuse it with Gazi Antep, which is on the same block)  are both the döner kebab and something most westerners never think of trying,  the işkembe çorbası, also known as 'panzensuppe' or tripe soup.A brief word on the döner kebab (which I get in the dürüm döner form, where the bread wrap is thin like a flour tortilla):  for some reason, it is, for me, the most consistently satisfying rendering of the classic German version of the classic Turkish kebab sandwich.  The combination of meats and veggies and flavorings has always been perfectly balanced.But now for the something remarkable, the işkembe çorbası.  Everywhere else I've had it, and I do mean everywhere,  there is far less meat, and the flavor tends to be way more dishwater.   The işkembe here is loaded with both substance and flavor.  You can get it with garlic, which means a spoonful of a garlic sauce,  and then add red pepper flakes ('urfa biber').  You can also indulge in free veggies (like onions and whole peppers) on the side. Not only is it the best işkembe çorbası you can find,  but this is one of the most delicious and satisfying  soups you'll ever experience.Köz Antep is on a nice, leafy, out of the way street;  it is close to the 'Dom' fun fair;  it is a bit of a walk from public transportation (S-St. Pauli, or the Reeperbahn),  but for me that walk whets the appetite something enormous."
3,"What a delightful surprise!In a city centre populated by fast food joints, lousy service and that unmissable local ""attitude"" where it seems the customer is there to compliment the establishment and not the other way around, O-ren stands out.The food we ordered did take a long period to prepare, which is usually a good sign and one not to be taken for granted in this town. Finally there, we were all delightfully surprised how crunchy the vegetables were, delectable the meats and fresh the herbs tasted. Only slight drawback is the hectic service which is understandable since we were there during the lunch break. I think it might do the restaurant a world of good if they had more people manning the counters and tables during the prime time hours. Still they were friendly considering the influx of customers and long waiting line at the door. Still, we will definitely be regulars. Thanks for a good time."
3,"Really nice and cozy pub in the center of Hamburg. I enjoyed here a dinner after a soccer match...and it was kind of ""rejuvenating"". Nice beers and nice burgers.I took the Eva's: chicken breast, bacon and salad with fried potatoes. Really nice, good size and just 8€. Everything well cooked and the overall taste was well balanced.I really loved the internals, wooden table and chairs, rhe candles and the dark atmosphere!"
3,"Very good brunch with homemade marmalade, pesto and tiny pieces of delicious cheesecake! The staff is very friendly. I went there on a Sunday so it was very crowded in the small Coffee shop.I like to go there again."
3,"Yummy food, good service and a cozy atmosphere-- Das Dorf serves up a very nice German dining experience. Before our trip to Hamburg, we made a reservation at Das Dorf for a Saturday evening. We arrived for our reservation and was seated right away. The place doesn't look very big at first, but they definitely take advantage of every single corner available. The atmosphere is cosy albeit you're cramped into a cellar.I had the stewed ox cheeks and my husband had the schnitzel. The ox cheeks were very flavorful and the schnitzel was good. The portions were generous and the service was nice and fast. I would recommend Das Dorf for a nice dinner in Hamburg."
3,Impressive and great to see such diverse and exotic animals such as sharks and crocodiles in Hamburg. It is rather expensive so it requires a separate visit to the Tierpark.
4,All the tourists that visit Hamburg have to see the Rathaus (town hall) of Hamburg. It was build 1897 out of granite and sandstone. The roof is made out of copper. Just go in the city center of Hamburg and you will see the magnificent building. Secret hint: Between the windows you can see the 20 kings of the old German empire. Another hint: Find within the inner yard the fountain Hygieia-Brunnen that was made in memory of the victory against the cholera epidemic in 1892.
1,"Oh Lord, seriously, it's not that good, pretty below-average actually.For starters the food is expensive, and quality wise no better than average. What made things worse is that my vegetables were cold, so were my colleague's, and that made for a pretty crappy meal. I wonder what sort of system they have in the kitchen where the veggies end up cold by the time you get your plate.We sat outside and I thought the service was fairly inattentive, you really had to gesticulate to try and catch a waiter - the Greek restaurant to the right Olympisches Feuer, on the other hand are much more attentive, and is a better bet for a nicer meal.Lastly I ordered a Sagres from tap and it just didn't taste right. It was carbonated, but I suspect perhaps the lines hadn't been cleaner properly - it just had an off taste that made my stomach start to turn, you know, as if you had a bit of bacteria you didn't want to have. Nothing major, you get that as a beer drinker, but, not very good quality sadly, and I thought that Sagres being a Portuguese beer (as far as I know) would have at least tasted good from a Portuguese restaurant.It's another one of those cases where they have a great location on ""the strip"" and they don't have to make an effort, and people still come and eat there.Look I agree the location is nice.  But seriously go to the Olympisches Feuer just to the right, the service, food, value is all a touch better and you'l still be on the strip."
4,Very good food with cheap price especially for Arab people because you can fond traditional Arabic food. You can get all you can eat option with 7.5 euros. They have also good tea.
4,Possibly the best Wurst stand in Hamburg. A great variety of freshly grilled Wurst and always quickly served. A great snack when you're shopping or just passing through. What's great is that you don't have to cross the busy road as they have a stand on either side and they're right at the Mönckebergstraße U-Bahn Station. My personal favourite is the Bison Wurst.
3,"Nice place for the spring or summer, loads of parking and outside space. Our waitresses were very nice, informative and friendly which always helps for a chilled atmosphere. The service was with a smile and the cocktails and wine were better than expected. We had the set menu and enjoyed the overall experience. Try this place!"
3,"Christiansen's has a reputation of one of the best cocktail bars in Hamburg, where bartenders take seriously (meaning participating and winning bartender competitions) mixing all sorts of concoctions.So I thought it will be very trendy place, full of action, hot people, noise, bartenders shaking/mixing/stirring  you've got the picture. But no, very quiet, cool, relaxing place. They have all sorts of drinks of course and the list of cocktails is unbelivable. On Monday you can get free massage, which I absolutely have to try next time!"
3,This wasn't very peaceful place to eat a lunch because the tables were near to each other and the place was full. But I didn't mind anymore as soon as I saw the prices! I didn't know that it's possible to eat fish so cheap... I had my suspicions until I tasted my salmon with peppersauce and it was purely delicious. The salmon was well done and I definitely recommend everyone else taste it as well.
4,The best Crepes I've ever had (both savory and sweet) and the friendliest service of any place in Europe.
4,"Rating this place and giving it 5 stars is like shooting fish in a barrel.  It's the best place in Hamburg to hang, and luckily it's 10 minutes from me mum's house.  I always say ""I'm heading down to Strandperle"", but in reality I've never hung out at Strandperle, always at Ahoi, because it's breezier, and they have a decent weizenbier on tap.  I've been there in January, when it's just barely above freezing, and all the outdoor tables are full (Hamburgians's love to soak up rays on sunny days;  though if it's over 80 degrees, it tends to be less crowded because they find the heat a bit intolerable).The pizza is pretty good, but I usually just get the tap weissbier.   Getting a table outside in the shade can require some eagle-eyed patience, but you can pretty much always find a place in the sun, or take your drink 25 feet and sit on the sand.Far and away the best way to get there, if you mum doesn't live just up the hill,  is to take the ferry boat (#61 or #62), from Landungsbrucken or the Fischmarkt to Neumühlen/Övelgönne then walk west along the river.  It's part of the public transportation system, so you can travel on the ferry with your day pass,  or you can buy a ticket in the boat from a machine.  If you're up for a swim, there is a public indoor/outdoor swimming pool which is an 8-minute walk from the end stop on the ferry line, Finkenwerder.  (You can also actually swim in the river, off to the left from Ahoi/Strandperle, but the water is kinda brown.)  Then, after a swim, Ahoi/Strandperle is the perfect spot for some après -swim suds."
4,"The food here is unique. It is austrian with some traditional German plates. They were very friendly, even finding us a table without a reservation. A recommendation : make a reservation at first, just to be safe. They are also happy to have dogs there. To get there by public transport, ones can take the S1 to poppenbüttel or bus 8 to poppenbüttel Bahnhof and walk from there."
4,"I fled in here from the rain today, drenched and quite unhappy with the day. Had a breakfast Linz and some absolutely perfect coffee, very quiet today, lovely music, friendly service! Now I'm ready to face the stormy weather again :)"
3,"Wow, the best American-style breakfast I've seen in town so far! Fluffy pancakes with yummy Canadian maple syrup, and kaffee satt  free coffee refills! Cute deco, kinda small (could imagine it might be hard to get a table sometimes, but there seems to be room to squeeze 1-2 people in somewhere), and sometimes from time to time kinda loud music. Nice window bar-type seating as well, and the cheesecakes looked scrumptious! Friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices (2 big brunches and coffees for 2 for 21.40EUR). Will go again for brunch or coffee and cake!"
3,"Not a perfect taste but good in Hamburg. I tried first time in 2015 and was disappointed, after one year I tried again was much better than first experience. I had miso ramen and it was ok, the soup was thick enough but I'm not a fan of its noodle. Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) was good. If you like to eat spicy food (really spicy) karai ramen with Korean kimchi flavor would be the best choice."
4,"I was staying locally and asked a taxi driver for a recommendation, this place was it.  I had already noticed Urfa as it was always busy and the food looked so good.  Lots of locals, a really mixed group in this part of town, all enjoying some amazing food.  The service was chipper and the atmosphere quite different to any other kebab place I had eaten in. The meat was tender and tasty.  I could taste charcoal on the chicken and it was perfect.  As was the lamb.I really, heartily recommend Oz Urfa."
4,"Can't recommend this place enough. I lived my whole life in Bavaria but had to move to Hamburg to finally get some real handmade quality Spätzle again! In Augsburg, where I come from, it's gotten pretty hard to get good old fashion Käsespätzle because a lot of places turned into tourist-traps.Zum Spätzle is a very small and cozy place. It was cold outside so the warm and humid atmosphere inside was extra cozy. And with the smell of Käsespätzle in the Air I felt like visiting my grandmas ""gute Stube"". Everything is locally sourced and hand made. Especially the information about the Eggs coming from a farm where the male chicks are not killed was very valuable to me. There are dishes for vegetarians and vegans as well. So chose your Spätzle with Meatloaf or Tofu. I have not tried the Maultaschen, yet. But I sure want to do that someday.Both times I ate there I had a Spätzle dish. First time Käsespätzle with Meatloaf and brown onions was like my dream. Although I prefer my Meatloaf a bit more on the chunky side. This was almost too smooth. But everything tasted flawless, perfect balance of Spätzle and Cheese, the Gravy was to die for. Second time I had Käsespätzle ""pure"". What can I say, I love them. High quality for reasonable prices and you can get a free Spätzle-refill If you're not stuffed yet. Which you will want but can't manage to eat.Service is nice and chilled and asks for dessert & coffee in the best way without being pushy. Which is a quality I like very much. Lastly the place is so cosy with lots of pillows, natural wood, warm light and the smell of my childhood. At my grandmas or at a small cottage-restaurant were my parents used to take us to eat after we went hiking at the Alps. I recommend making a reservation if you want to eat there in the evening. I got lucky both of the times I went there. But I will visit again and again and I can not recommend enough to go and try it. Even If you are a tourist from Bavaria! Go and get some good Spätzle again!"
4,"This was a truly fantastic meal, possibly the best we have had on our trip in Germany.I got the filets of 3 fish in dijon sauce, and my partner ordered the schnitzel.  The fish was out of this world, some of the best I have ever had, and the sides it came with were amazing as well.  To drink I had the peppermint and ginger tea which they make themselves, and the waitress/owner offered refills of hot water for the tea, and brought tap water to drink (a rare pleasure for Canadians who are used to always having free tap water at restaurants).  The tea was really an unexpected bonus to the meal, as I was expecting dried tea, instead of fresh leaves and ginger.  Even the sugar to add to the tea was crystal rock sugar instead of plain ground white sugar.I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the fish or the local fare, however you should make a reservation or be prepared to sit outside / wait, as it is very popular!"
4,Amazing pastries! Worth a U ride! Even the vegan cake was tasting so delicious and not the one where the taste buds get a leftover tast
4,"This was the only Italian restaurant that was open late, so we decide to give it a try, and I'm really happy we did. I forgot to post this so I don't remember all of the dood we ate, but I do remember how fantastic the grilled calamari was. Everything was absolutely delicious."
4,"This is a once in a life time experience!That was the best thing i have done in Hamburg since i got here.... Dialog in Dunkel offers you the chance to experience life as a blind person.Depending on the course you choose, you can spend between 1/2 and 1 h (i presume) in complete darkness - dunkel - being guided by a blind person through different rooms. Each room has a different theme, which you explore using your hands and other senses be it hearing or smelling.. you even get to a bar where u need to pay for your drinks this is something everyone in hamburg should do..."
4,"Awesome vegan Cafe that serves very yummy and interesting dishes. Not just healthy but also tasty.Only bummer: They only accept cash, so come prepared.Had the quiche with a salad and this definitely feds you up.Highly recommended, even if you're not a vegan ;)"
4,"Things to know about this place: it's very centrally located, just around the corner from the Rathaus, it's actually open in the late evenings (unlike most places in this district), and it has really nice local beers (called Messing and Kupfer). The food is very decent as well."
4,"This place was amazing!  The place was easy to find and very cute inside.  They had an English menu; our waitress was amazing and spoke fluent English, and made great suggestions with the menu.  I had the Spätzle with cheese and bacon and my boyfriend had the special, a lemon and rosemary Spätzle - both were large portions and very delicious.  This was our first dinner in Hamburg and I would recommend it for anyone! I would recommend if you have a larger group to make a reservation ahead of time, as a good portion of the tables were reserved when we arrived.  They also have Wifi for anyone traveling."
4,"Reason for this report:1. Personally, I am a railway fan and own a digital model railway in scale 1:87 constructed by Märklin of Göppingen in Germany. 2. Men and women differ much from each other's. Whereas men are mostly interested in technical stuff, women are more interested in landscapes. In this report I want to invite every visitor to Hamburg to go and see the ""Miwula"" as the Mini Wonderland call themselves. Additionally, I shall give a few tips. Owner:At the end of the 90s the Braun brothers Gerret and Freddy of Hamburg had the idea to build the world's largest model railway and to show it to the public against entrance fees. As they both seem to be ""crazy guys"", they have not only tried to be the largest, but also to amend unique highlights. Unfortunately I don't know any of them, I have seen them only on TV.Until today, their company has grown to as much as 100 employees.Site:The ""Miwula"" is located in the ""Speicherstadt"" (= storage quarter where old storage houses are located) on the 4th level of Block D on the street Kehrwieder #2. It can best be reached by public transport. The subway station ""Baumwall"" on the yellow line ""U3"" is only 10 minutes walk away from the ""Miwula"". For car fans, there are some pay parking lots available, which are quickly overcrowded on the weekend or during the holiday season. Waiting hours:Since the ""Miwula"" has opened in 2001, it has become one of the main attractions in downtown Hamburg. As it is only possible to see something if there are not more than about 100 people inside, the Miwula Management has decided not to let more than these 100 people inside. If there are more visitors, they will have to wait until other people have left again. On weekends and during the holiday season, it may happen that you wait more than an hour.VERY GOOD: as a spezial serviced the ""Miwula"" offers on ist website statistics about the waiting hours of the past and predict the visitors of the next days including waiting hours. Usually, there are more visitors around lunch time. NICE: on the homepage you can also find suggestions where to go elsewhere in Hamburg. What a pity that they have only two suggestions.Opening hours:Daily from 9.30 AM until 6.00 PM, on Tuesday until 9 PMOn the weekend from 8.30 AM until 8 PM. Especially in the evening hours the ""Miwula"" is highly flexible, also during special event like the Harbor Anniversary or the Football World Championship. Entrace fees:Adults EUR 9 (~£ 6 or $ 11.50), Children under 16y EUR 4 (~£ 2.70 or $ 5), Children smaller than 1 meter are free. They have a variety of rebates for seniors and groups and even yearly subscription cards. For a family with two kids the total entrance fee would be EUR26. I personally believe that it's worth its money. About the Traings and landscape:The ""Miwula"" only shows trains in scale 1:87 (which in Germany is called H0 = half nill), most trains go on the Märklin digital system with 16V AC power. In the US contruction part, however, the trains go on DC power system. Most visitors won't realize this fact, however this construction makes it impossible for the trains to switch between these two systems. On the other hand this is quite realistic, as you will hardly find US trains in Europe and vice versa.Every 15 minutes the lights will turn from white to red, then blue until they are switched off for a few minutes to simulate the night. Interestingly, the constructors have also achieved that the train and car traffic is reduced in volume during this time. It is a very realistic simulation of the night & day changes.Phase 1 of the construction reflects Southern and Central Germany and was constructed within eight months. On the 300 square meters there are 3 kilometers of tracks with 450 switches. 230 trains with 2,400 coaches roll over the layout. Already in Phase 1 the constructor were very successful to implement small scenes with much love for details. In one area you see prisoners escaping from jail, in another a loving couple in the forest, and yet in another some strike activities in a coal mine. As a further technical highlight, there are many model cars in the same scale driving through the many streets. It is always big fun when the fire engines get out to address a burning house or castle. Quickly after finishing the first Phase, the ""Miwula"" got quickly known and attracted many visitors. In November 2002, Phase 2 was opened showing Hamburg and the North German Coast line. You see the separate subway systems, street demonstrations, a Techno Move and many other fabulous details. One of the most important models is the making of the Hamburg Football stadium. Even the large screens in scale 1:87 work and can be illuminated in whatever direction. Ín December 2003 Phase 3 was finished: America. Here you can find Las Vegas with all its lights, models of the famous Big Boy - the largest ever built steam engine, you see temperature announcements on the highway in °F (instead of °C), and on Area 51 some"
2,"The food was okay, but the service was terrible. I had to stand up to get the waitress's attention. I ordered the grill plate, but asked for extra salad instead of rice. The server brought the food and apologized for not having extra salad instead of rice, but still gave it as is. I would have thought if she knew the problem, she would have given extra salad or addressed it somehow (I didn't want to pay for the rice and have it just go to waste), but she just left it. She never brought the hummus I had ordered, so I ended up getting up and going to the counter inside to ask for it. The grill plate also wasn't as described and was missing the stuffed meatball. The hummus was very good and the chicken was pretty solid, but everything else was just okay. The servers in the restaurant also came out for their smoke breaks and sat down on a stoop literally right behind my chair, which was pretty obnoxious. I wouldn't recommend this place."
1,"Interesting little restaurant. It was packed, and it seemed that food was being served almost cafeteria style on silver trays, so I figured it practical to order take away. One would think I would receive the same amount of food by paying the same price (and not taking up table space in the tiny restaurant for that matter), but I ended up receiving significantly less food. It didn't even come with all items included on the menu (no salad, sauce, or yogurt). I received literally one and a half small chicken drumsticks for the main portion. The taste was decent; I just felt a little swindled out of my money. I wouldn't bother with take out again."
4,"We had a really nice dinner here during a quick trip to Hamburg.I like to start a steakhouse dinner with a classic cocktail (manhattan for me, martini for my date).  This place had a very good bartender on duty that evening.  The chopped salad needed to be a bit more 'chopped,' and it had a bit too much dressing but overall wasn't bad.  The meat was great.  I had Argentinian, because I prefer grass-fed beef, and my date had American.  Both were *perfectly* seasoned and perfectly cooked.  We would have liked to try the European beef (which is dry-aged), but the smallest cut was 900g or so?  seemed much too big.  The waiter explained the reason why the cuts were so big, but we couldn't completely understand.The wine list was extremely expensive, comparatively speaking, but seemed well chosen.  Service was very professional.  Beef:  it's a nice break from Hamburg Pann-fisch!"
3,"To be totally honest i don't come here to eat. I come for the beer!For the huge (1L) mass beer!And their pretzels! Lovely 'Oktoberfest themed' pub.I've been there only by night. on the week ends its always packed. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in a typical bavarian costums.There's also live music, typical german folkoric music, that i as a non-german dont know, but still dance to! It's a great place, especially if you're out of town or you have visitors."
4,"This spot is really charming; between the lit candles, fresh flowers, wife serving and husband cooking, this is exactly what one might envision when dreaming of European bistro. But let's talk about the food: Traditional Northern German. Unfortunately, I did not have time to research a lot before this trip, and ignorantly I assumed I would be limited to spätzle and sausage. Behold!  Labskaus - an old, traditional sea farer's dish, made from potatoes, pickled beef and beetroot, served with gherkins, beetroot and pickled herring. Labskaus reminds me of a non-greasy, light, almost fluffy corned beef hash. It was topped with 2 farm eggs and was divine. I appreciated that I was going to order a side salad but was advised against it because with the beets and gherkins, that would be too much. How honest! I finished with a spot of peppermint and ginger tea - fresh and strong. Between the reasonable prices, quality food and wonderful service, I would highly recommend this spot.Gluten free dining notes: The Labskaus does not contain bread crumbs, soy sauce nor Worchester sauce. Enjoy!The Creme Brûlée, however, is thickened with flour. :("
3,"We were visting the Bistro, not the Brasserie, so cannot comment on the latter. Further, we had the meal as part of the hotel's package, so any comments on whether it's price-worthy I cannot made. It was quite ok. Food was good (although the kids had a better choice, IMO) and the service was friendly. The only criticism I have, and it's something which happens in many places: Service was efficient while the place was packed, but later on, with fewer guests, there weren't many around anymore."
4,I didn't try the sweet goodies; instead I had a pasta. Pretty delicious at a very cheap price.
4,"Great place to have dinner eating typical food of hamburg: fish!Nice interior, great and nice service, beer and wine, quick service.For us this evening was the last of a few days in hamburg; a real great finish!"
3,"They just finished renovating and have a whole second floor for eating now! It's a great place to grab a quick meal before a movie at the Savoy. Fast and quick, but still pretty tasty. I don't want to know why it's so cheap, but I'll take it."
3,"Wow - all the hype is accurate! Really good/incredible cakes and coffee. Minus one star because it's so busy and loud. We came at 4pm on a Friday, prime Kaffeeklatsch time and it was really busy. The cheesecake was probably the best I've ever had, the poppy seed mousse cake with cassis was also incredible but my rhubarb meringue cake was disappointing. The cake was flavorless, the filling was really solid, and the meringue was weepy. Pour over coffee was great too. Will absolutely be back. I wish they had a cookbook I could buy!"
4,"The falafel wraps here are SO GOOD! I really like how they use real whole vegetable toppings in their wraps instead of stuffing it with cold cabbage or lettuce. Aaaand you can also watch them prepare/cook the falafel balls in front of you, so you know they're fresh. For EUR3,50 you really can't get a better deal. Five stars and two thumbs up!"
4,Cool burger place in Hamburg Schanze. Excellent burgers (150g patties). We came to eat at 17:30 and had a choice of tables. Good beers. The sweet potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent addition.
3,"This was an interesting and educational way to spend two hours on a rainy day in Hamburg. We did the tour which includes decorating your own chocolate bar, learning about the process of chocolate from the raw cocoa pods and importing and then how it's turned into the delicious chocolate at the end. Our tour guide spoke terrific English (check their schedule for what languages are toured at what times) and it was quite educational.Of course, there's a huge chocolate gift shop at the end and how can you not buy a bunch of interesting edible and decorative items to bring home?Expect to eat some chocolate along the way, so don't be too stuffed when you arrive.[Review 12058 overall, 1841 of 2019.]"
4,"Wow, tolles Essen! Sehr interessante Einrichtung. Nette Bedienung. Wir sind rundum glücklich :) Mittagstisch um die 10EUR und wahnsinns gute Qualität!"
3,This is a nice plate for a quick bite to eat. You can feel a bit rushed when it's crowded with several people waiting in line. The food is pretty good and healthy . I usually get a salad or sandwich which is prepared for everyday consumption. Most of the items in the fridge have dates on it so you'll know when it was lasted prepared for eating.
4,That was definitely the fastest served burger i've ever had. It was also tasty. Fries could be better though. Still 5 stars because i enjoyed the burger and dont care about fries.
3,"I went there based on the numerous positive suggestions. It is in the basement of the building on a pretty little street. I had called in with a reservation request and they promised me that a table would be open. But once I got there, still had to wait 10 minutes to sit down, which was a bit of a bummer. I ordered a Salmon, Spinach and Tomato savory crepe. It took a while to get but it was very delish. The salmon was a bit salty but very flavorful. I went for a sweet crepe (sugar and lime) and that was even better than the savory option.My recommendation is for you to stick to the sweet options if you decide to check it out. They are far superior and just as good as the ones you get on the streets of the City of Lights."
1,"Well,used to be better. Years ago I was here regularly. But CIU changed for the worse:Drinks: still a big selection. But just not good anymore. Wrong ingredients and somehow too watery.Service: leave me alone...Atmosphere: Too noisy, you just can't talk. Empty by 1am.Conclusion: Won't come again soon. There are better alternatives in Hamburg."
3,"I was surprised to see a concept like green lovers here in Hamburg. It reminded me of Mixt Greens in San Francisco.The menu includes suggested salads, a make-your-own salad option, soups, and panini. All of the salads are made fresh when you order. I went with the falafel veggie salad special they had advertised on the counter with the green lovers dressing (herbs, lemon, olive oil). It had a great balance of ingredients and a nice hummus on top. Definitely a fan.Service was also surprisingly friendly despite the lunch rush. Again, other than that whole ordering in German part, I felt like I had just walked through a portal to Mixt Greens in downtown SF.The only downside is that the space is a little tight and is pretty much packed by 12:30pm. If you'd like a place to sit and don't mind getting bumped into every so often, I'd aim for right before noon and stick to parties of 2. The line always moves fast and they offer takeout, so that could be a good plan B if you happen to arrive after half of Hamburg's workforce has."
1,"Food was good but not worth the money. Service was relatively average and although the location of the restaurant is great, the place is rather dead.FOOD:Great menu! A lot of interesting options gives a very nice first impression. The food is good but completely overpriced. It lacks the nice spicy taste of asian cuisine and it is not very traditional. Also I've noticed some Vietnamese restaurants have started adding onion crumbs into their buns (yeah those you add to hot dogs and other junk food). Unfortunately my dish had that unwanted ingredient. Until this point I had already thought of giving the place a solid three stars; however, the dish was full of hairs and eye lashes which cost them a good rating.SERVICE:Slow, careless and unfriendly. Unfortunately these are the first words that come to mind after eating here. The waiter was way too serious and rather unhelpful. Showed no patience and just wanted to get the job done. Also although we were initially alone in the restaurant it took forever for them to take our order, bring our food and later to take our card. A change in attitude (or staff) might help this restaurant improve its service. LOCATION: Hoheluftchaussee is one of Hamburg's nicest places to go out for dinner. It is very lively and there is a lot to choose from. However this restaurant is rather spiritless. On a positive note the place is big making it perfect for big groups and spontaneous visits without a reservation."
2,Do you want to experience bavaria in north germany? Come here then! It has litter beers and german food. I went on a friday night and it as really loud with live music. The staff is dressed up with bavarian attire so its a nice touristy attraction. The staff wasnt too friendly but they did give us english menus to help us out. Good place for beers.
4,"Great coffee! So many different variations, and a small selection of cakes. Very small coffee shop so it can get crowded but they also have tables and chairs outside."
4,I am in love with this place. The coffee... the food... the decor and the staff... all top notch. Such a nice atmosphere! My friend and I sat at the window and enjoyed a latte and a Guatemalan Filterkaffee & Käsekuchen. We liked it so much we even stayed for a second cup! Staff was knowledgeable about the different types of coffee and took the time to explain each one. Thank you for the great service and the tasty treats!
4,"I visited on a Sunday.  You have 3 levels with different themes/periods and you start on the top floor.  Got here around 1 pm and not very many visitors.I really liked the simple descriptions of the car/items that gave you some good/quick insights.   They had a vintage Porsche drive simulator which was pretty cool.  This was quite popular and would imagine a queue during busy days.Although small, they have a good selection of mint or near mint condition vintage cars and concepts.   Really liked the 996 display showing 1/2 interior and 1/2 exterior.   Although they do have VW and Audi concepts, the majority of the display is Porsche.  There is a cafe with gift shop that has an good selection of books and model cars & some clothing.Only 10 Euros entry fee with a friendly and helpful staff.  Plan on 1.5 to 2 hours.  A must for any Porsche lover and enthusiast!"
3,"""Create you own salad"" places are really hard to find in Europe and look no further people because this is one of them! So excited to be able to build my own salad. You pick a base four toppings and a protein. The salads come with a slice of bread and I found the small salad to be quite filling. The mint tougher dressing was really tasty and refreshing so I definitely recommend it. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating and not very crowded for lunch!"
3,"Pizza is extremely delicious. Dough is paper-thin and made fresh in their open kitchen. Really great recipe. I went there for dinner twice during a 4-day stay in Hamburg. Pizzas are one size only, which is huge, so unless you haven't eaten for 3 days, don't order a whole pizza for yourself, you will be very satisfied with just a half. Toppings are amazing, however, depending on which pizza you order, you may get a very small amount of the premium ingredients. This was true with the Caprese pizza which came only with 3 small slices of mozzarella and with the spicy salsiccia pizza, which came with just a handful of the spicy pepperoni slices. They have English-language menus available, a modest wine list, a nice decor, comfortable general ambiance and it was very busy both times I was there (a Saturday night, around 22:00 and a Tuesday evening, around 19:00).However, you must be wondering why I didn't rate this place with 5 stars... The answer is very simple: They serve you the wine in small ""water glasses"". And they're not even the nice kind of water glasses... I'm talking about the cheap, ugly kinds that you buy a dozen for 0,50€ at a discount store. Germany is a country of very strict laws and they should make one where restaurants are not allowed to serve wine unless they are served in wine glasses. In fact, it should be a crime to not serve wine in a proper wine glass! Specially in an Italian restaurant! I would not be surprise if Italy, along with every wine producer and sommelier in the world does not decide to rage war against this place. It was really an abomination when the waitress placed a glass of red wine on my table using that horrid glass. I immediately asked for a proper wine glass. The waitress on Saturday night promptly gave a ""you're not the only one to ask smile"" and brought a proper wine glass. Unfortunately, the waitress from Tuesday night said there were no more proper wine glasses available even though I was seated right in front of the bar and could clearly see at least 8 clean wine glasses in the shelf... Not cool. In short: fantastic pizza, order without fear! Despicable way of serving wine... Whose idea was this? Bacchus, the Roman God Of Wine is crying at the moment..."
4,"Best. Schnitzel. Ever. This was my birthday dinner, and it was perfect. The restaurant is a bar and a room for roughly 24 people. No reservations. Waiting is standing room only. But it was worth it. Very much worth it. We both ordered the Schnitzel - since we did not want to share. Their wine selection is small but very good as well. I tried a few of their whites by the glass. Portions were perfect and the room was cheery and warm.Next time I will save room for dessert."
3,"The burritos are wonderfully juicy, which makes them hopeless to eat, but you won't care. You'll be on the most wonderful journey exploring that burrito, one bite at a time, going deeper and deeper into a food-haze. Next stop: sweat pants city. I had the pulled-beef (soup?) with... um, everything.I do have some (minor) criticism:Burritos are made in front of your eyes, yet once they're done they are taken away for heating -- forever. Why? It's not even that hot once you get it.I'm also not a fan of the ambiance. I get it; ""it's a fast food place, it should look like it"". I'm not sure what it is, I think it might be the florescent lights in one end combined with the dark-ish-ness in the other; it makes my brain confused. I want the same warm fuzzy feeling that burrito gives to be confirmed by my eyes.Not that I'll be looking or even be aware once I'm halfway done. But still.This is the closest to ""Californian cooking"" I've experienced since my half year living there; a time where eating was one big blur, and I can't remember any particular burrito. But I do remember the feeling. It's the feeling of Qrito."
4,"Excellent Vietnamese restaurant in Hamburg?! Who'd have thought it? This is a low-key, friendly establishment, which is reasonably priced and has delicious food. The staff are so friendly that when our credit card didn't work they said, just pay next time! When does that ever happen?! Starters and mains for 3, including wine, comes to around EUR70. Recommended."
3,Great atmosphere. Fresh food. Good service. Bustling. Reservations recommended but helpful to get seated if not. Smaller menu selection. Menu changed weekly.
4,"A great Turkish lunch spot, with tasty food and incredibly fast service! I'm usually here atleast once a week for lunch. I really like the chicken with rice plate, and mixed sharp/yogurt sauce. The staff is really friendly; you can get by with English if necessary. Seating is kind of hard to come by around lunch, but they have mixed standing/seating areas. Even if you don't stay, there is someone always offering tea, which is such a nice treat."
1,Delicious food!!!Funky atmosphere!!!The entire experience was ruined by the waiter attempting to flirt with my boyfriend the whole time!!!
3,"Shikara is a good Indian food place. I have only tried their lunch buffet which for a flat fee you get a full meal (an entrée, main course and desert).  They have friendly staff and a nice outdoor garden area."
1,"The view is great - and that's basically it. Knowing this location for several years now, one must say that the quality decreased over time. Nowadays the cocktails are too pricy for their quality (for example Boilerman, Le Lion Bar de Paris are better options). On top the service is slow and needs to be constantly reminded of previous orders."
4,"Absolutely delicious combinations of ingredients which left me reeling days after I had dinner there! Asparagus season is in full swing and nearly every sea food dish we had incorporated asparagus somehow, whether it be in the sauce or simply accompanying vegetables. Friendly staff there too made it a pleasant evening. It's also possible to sit outside which is nice on warmer evenings. Dessert, namely Spanish style creme caramel with strawberries, asparagus and mint salad, was absolutely scrumptious! Will definitely be recommending this place to friends and returning there myself! Reasonable prices, especially worth it due to quality of food, and all set menus are def worth a try!"
3,"I went there for lunch and ate one of the day's specials - a plate with rice, salad and turkey meat with vegetables. The food was tasty, cooked just right and the portion was exactly big enough. The line can get huge during lunch, however, so don't plan on a quick 5 minute trip here if you're going for lunch during the week."
3,"One of the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever tried! Dishes are amazing! You can get a big bowl of fried chicken, rice and vegetables for 10€.I'm used to go there with co-workers. Please note that space is really reduced, the restaurant is usually crown around lunching hours (around 12pm - 1pm). Unfortunately, the menu is just in German on a blackboard on the wall (just pick randomly...)"
4,"Excellent rib eye steak!!! One of the best steaks I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. Being from Texas, and having grown up on a ranch, eating steaks my whole life, you will not be disappointed here. The service is a little slow, order more beer to take up the extra time!! The cheesecake is excellent, not as good as Don't Tell Mama's, here in Hamburg, but well worth eating. Busy restaurant, never had trouble getting a table. A little better than Estancia Steak House because of price , and the cheesecake."
4,"Even if it seems that there is a lot of people waiting in front of the restaurant, you won't wait for a long time as the waiters and the cooks are fast and friendly, which is really convenient when it is your lunch break. I took a döner in a flatbread (for just 4,50€) and I really had enough even though I didn't take any side. You can either consume on the spot or take away your food, which is appreciable."
3,"Really cute crepes place with delicious crepes! This place gets really packed sometimes as it may be a little touristy but the crepes quality is great! We walked in over the weekend and managed to grab a table for 2 fairly easily. Seems like if you have a larger group or are coming at peak times, you may want to make a reservation ahead of time.Once we got seated, we started with just 2 cups of espresso. Later on I found out I should have ordered one of the ciders. I did see the table next to us order a bottle of cider and poured it into 2 cute tea cups! Ahhh I should have ordered that! Next time! Ok so we had our espressos which were great! then we ordered our savory crepes and also put in an order for our dessert ones. I don't remember the names of our savory crepes but really everything is really good so just pick one! For the dessert crepes we had the plain sugar with butter and also a nutella crepe. Nutella crepes are always delish but I find it a little to rich for my taste. I enjoyed my simple desert crepe. I really wanted the crepe with sugar and lemon but forgot to order the lemon. It was still really good but yes, I need to come back here! :)Overall it's a great place for an afternoon crepe if you are sightseeing or just want a lighter lunch!"
4,"Great food, nice service, good atmosphere! You get a tasty treat of flat bread with olive oil and an herb mix to enjoy while you're waiting for your mealand it's worth the wait. Unique flavors, trendy style. More of a fusion/modern cuisine than Lebanese  excellent food! Be sure to reserve a seat if you want to go on the weekend."
2,"This is a good place for lunch if you're looking for something on the healthy side. If I were vegetarian, I would probably eat here a lot. The food isn't strictly vegetarian, but most of the dishes are, or at least lean in that direction (meat as an accompaniment, rather than the main event).I've tried their pasta (I think it was gnocchi), and their sweet potato curry (with chickpeas). Both dishes were filling but not exactly bursting with flavor. The rice that came with my curry had been par-boiled, and then boiled again just before serving, but apparently not enough because it was still a little too chewy.On the plus side, food is served cafeteria-style, so you can get in and out quickly, and you can see what you're getting.Not my favorite place for lunch, but not terrible, either."
4,i eat there once or 2 times a week. the food is always delicious.the employees are friendly and they always offer me a free tea :)
0,"That was the worst food poisoning for mussels I ever had in my life, almost survived! Do not recommend this kitchen at all."
3,"Very nice and reasonable food in a casual set up, but a little small for big groups. The service was nice, the people are really nice but do not understand any language other than german so for tourists it is a little harder but pointing out what you want is never a problem. Very good for vegetarians."
4,"Wow highly recommend this place! I would come back here next time I visit Hamburg because the food was absolutely delicious. I had asparagus and ricotta ravioli and it was absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge fan of asparagus but it's asparagus season right now so it was fresh and delicious. In addition the ravioli was hand made earlier and was extremely fresh and just melted in your mouth. Without a doubt some of, if not, the best ravioli I've ever had. Would highly recommend visiting here if in Hamburg (just make sure you go to the right one) and I plan to come back. Also as a note they had an English menu which was extremely helpful!"
4,"Usually portions in Germany are pretty huge and I am not able to finish them. That was not a case in this place, but not because the portion was too small. It was just so tasty:) Also, I definitely recommend Scweinemedallions mit käse:D Also I'm a big soup fan, so that will be my next thing there to try out, as for I saw they serve it inside big piece of bread.Should be tasty. They also have vegetarian menu, pizzas, salads and what else not, so there definitely should be something for everybody.Prices are really ok, too.Other than that this place is great because of its location and its really has that vibe, that you want to spend there all those rainy Hamburg evenings."
2,"Brilliant food, unbelievably slow service. Breakfast we got here was lovely but it took 75 mins to serve scrambled eggs & bacon."
4,"I haven't been here in a while (as I don't work in the area any longer) but I LOVED this place! GREAT food, nice service, good value and when the weather is nice you can sit outside. I must get back there.Delicious!"
2,The food was normal ... my sister and husband didn't finish the beef ... we have tried much better Persian food in Germany ... the staff were nice though .. price was good too ..
3,"i went there for the first time on the Tanz in den Mai night!Entrance fee was just 2EURdrinks were rather cheaphowever it was so full with sweaty smelly dancing-elbow-to-elbow drunk people. They played 80s music... although im not a fan of that genre, it was ok. A lot of michael jackson for my taste, but i enjoyed itbut there was no place for us to standhowever turns up there is a second floorwe went up there and it was very pleasant.Different style of music, mostly commercial music and house (not very actual songs, but very danceable) there is also a bar - and a bathroom - in the 2nd floor. If you're ever there, keep in mind: there is a less crowded second floor :)"
4,Hamburg is the SF of Europe. The harbor vibes with them dope coffee shops mang!!! Nord coast is one of the more classy joints with food on their menu. It overlooks the water and has a good amount of seating. Their lattes and espressos are on point. The cost wasn't overwhelming and their staff is very friendly. A great place to meet up with people.
4,"Klasse Laden, nette Leute! Toller Treffpunkt fuer allerlei Oldtimerfans"
3,"Great service; friendly, observant, and check in with customers often. They do not except tips, and will make sure to hand it back to you, stating ""das werd nicht nötig, aber bis nächstes mal."" But I still recommend trying ;) Last, but certainly not least, the food was fantastically, authentically full of wonderfully spiced and seasoned flavors. I highly recommend this restaurant. Minus one star from Perfect, simply because the option on the menu for meals was a little confusing. But in the end I found the Ente and the veggie dish to be just what I wanted."
2,"3 stars because i am not a fan of zoos. and because its not THAT bigBut ive been told this is the biggest privately financed zoo in germany. i went there during the jungle nights in june. entrance costs 17.5EUR (1.5EUR extra to the normal days)On that night, the zoo was open till at least 11.30 with shows all over the zoo. Well as i said before i am not a fan of zoos, so i cant say i had a lot of fun. It's not very big but has a number of different exotic animals. But the thing is I've been to the Leipzig zoo and the leipzig one was much bigger than hamburgs with much more variety. So i was kinda suprised that hamburgs zoo wasnt 'small' And on that evening, hagenbecks was really full, and a lot of kids running back and forth. They seemed to be enjoying their time. Now that i have seen the zoo, supported it financially, i don't think i will be back.Ive seen their lions, pinguins, giraffes, monkeys, tigers, lions ... so i dont need to come back to see them all over again :P Oh and the kangaroo part of the zoo stinks by the way, i couldnt stay inside more than 30 seconds! The best part is that you can feed the animals, had i known i would have taken some fruits and veggies with me... However, worth the visit. I dont regret going there at all!"
3,"Came here last night as we were showing some visiting family the Hafen City area and some great views of the harbour area.I have walked past a few times but not tried it here. So we tried it!All in all, a very nice Thai food experience. Nice and polite service in English and/or German, no fuss when we asked for simple non-spicy food (chicken noodle stir fry) for the children and then on opting for the 3 smaller set tasting menus (one each of A, B & C) for EUR33 got a wonderful mix of truly delicious authentic food.Only downside was the cost, but I guess in this part of town ( yuppie flats, business expense lunches and cruise ship tourists) it is what it is plus the food really is very good here.So for 3 set meals, 2 childrens meals, 5 drinks + service = not much change from EUR200 !!So all in all, very nice for a special family treat (but just not that often)"
4,"A very enjoyable casual meal. We were in the area and found Scharf for lunch. While it wasn't an important criterion, the price of the meal was very reasonable. The food was well prepared and presented. If you're in the area, it's a very good choice. It may not be worth the time to travel there from a significant distance."
3,"Great panino and pasta, friendly staff, coffee not the best"
3,"4 Stars for the Burger.  My boyfriend and I were too late Saturday night to eat in the main dining room, so we tried the front deli.  It was ok, nice ambience, service and decor, and the food was okay.  However, the burger was great.  Came with coleslaw, fresh tomato and a perfectly cooked piece of burger.  Every evenly flavored and overall amazing.  Onion soup needed a spice pick up.  Would try this place again!"
4,"Amazing presentation, delicious food, discreet service and lovely view  always forget how nice it is here!"
4,"Seit wir vor 1 1/2 Jahren nach Niendorf gezogen sind, sind wir regelmässig dort gewesen. Frisch, lecker (!), reichlich, günstig, was will man mehr. Und zum draußen sitzen ist es auch noch ganz besonders nett, da nicht direkt auf dem Tibarg sondern ein bißchen versteckt im Durchgang.Ganz besonders gerne läuten wir hier an einem warmen Freitag späten Nachmittag das Wochenende ein  Entspannung pur!Die Bedienung ist außerordentlich freundlich, immer! Gäste zum großen Teil etwas älter, wie so oft in Niendorf, aber uns stört's nicht, wenn wir action wollen, gehen wir ins City Wir sind froh, daß wir dieses Kleinod gefunden haben."
1,"I went a Sunday night with a friend. The place is nice and the sofas very comfortable. The service on the other hand was bad. I took a Mojito that was OK. My friend a virgin cocktail, but the fruit wasn't fresh. It was evident that was made from a juice box out of fridge. In addition, we had to pay straight away... It is a pity - very nice place with bad service"
3,Quaint little restaurant. Gets busy..make resvs'. All looks delicious. The home made cider is super yumm. They also have a clothing store in there.. They all look like fishermen.. Haha and like any good french place - it seriously smells like butter! Enjoy!
1,"Nice location! The food is actually not bad. I got the hamburg special which was panfish with potatoes. It was pretty delicious. One of my friends got the currywurst and it was massive and looked pretty good. I would suggest getting the currywurst if you are ever here. We were here to watch germany play during one of the world cup games. The place was busy but the service was pretty quick. One massive complaint I have is the server gave me an attitude. They had the game on a projector and the game kept cutting off and the picture quality was just awful. I was my phone out (mind you it was my US phone and it doesn't have service in germany) I took it out to show some pictures to my friend and the server came over and singled me out and told me not to use my phone because it was interfering with the quality of the picture on the projector. I was the only person in the entire bar she told this to, even though my phone doesn't receive any service in Hamburg. Not cool!The food deserves three stars i had to remove a star because of the service."
4,"Wow! That's all I can say- this place was phenomenal! The ambiance, the staff and the food- OMG the food! Some of the best and freshest Sushi I have ever had. The ambiance of the place is fantastic- load but not too much, the staff great and watching the chefs cook in open kitchen helped make a great meal even better. 3 of us ate a literal boatload of Sushi and had a very nice bottle of wine, and it was only €50 a head."
4,"Everything was authentic- the service, food and atmosphere! Would highly recommend. We got both the tikka masala and butter chicken, which were cooked perfectly"
4,"So delicious!! The place has a great cozy atmosphere! Not sure if they take reservations as we walked in around dinner time and managed to get a table for 4 without waiting, but the place is packed! For cocktails, they make great Moscow mules and spicy mules so I highly recommend these to start!For our appetizer we shared the fried spring rolls which came out piping hot to our table! One order comes with 4 rolls so we each had one which was perfect!For my entree, I went with the dry noodle/salad bowl with beef. I don't remember the proper name of it but it was really delicious. The portion was a pretty good size but I could have eaten more....It's ok though as we ordered another round of drinks so that satisfied my appetite :)Will definitely return soon to try everything else on the menu!!"
3,OVerall a great place to have German dinner. The restaurant is very small and intimate and you must make a reservation. Everything we tried was great. Check it out!
3,"Fantastic burgers! Good service. Wonderful ambiance. Cool designs. Just a very joyful experience here at Shiso Burger. Had the Salmon burger with fries and a coke and after first taste i can easily say that Shiso is a place to go for a really fantastic fish burger and others as well.Only thing, the sits are not the coziest and the prices are a little high for drinks with a combo menu. Also wasn't the easiest place to find, but in the end, I still recommend and will go again."
4,"Eiskantine, I am going to need new jeans soon because of you if I keep coming here so frequently.I have come here way too often in the last 2 months and every time is even better than the last. All of the flavours are absolutely delicious. An always changing collection of unique ice creams and sorbets."
4,"In the immortal words of superhans: ""What the f*'s a washing machine doing in a pub?! Jesus, I need a drink!"". Not only a washing machine either - a bed, table football, and a real hi-fi system. This place is kinda like hanging around in your own house, only you don't have to clean it when all your friends spill drinks everywhere. What a concept! I'm gonna take it to the UK..."
3,"Tasteful menu, craft beers, and bowling alley in the basementIf you like a modern international fare that focuses on German/European food I highly recommend the Freischwimmer.The restaurant comes with a sleek and dark design inside and a cozy beer garden outside. Plus, there is a fun two-lane bowling alley (ninepins) in the basement that you can rent before or after dinner!During my last visit with friends we had the 'calamaretti' (filled calamari), the EURO2016 Burger with cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola, the steak fritte and the Roast beef.Everything tasted great, and I would order it again, especially the calamaretti! However, the burger's toppings (cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola) could have been more.Besides a great menu, the drinks are great, as is the beer on tap and their craft beer selection as well.A nice finish for a fun evening with friends is the bowling alley! We had so much fun that we will be back for sure!+ tasteful diversified menu (changes monthly!)+ good drinks, wine and beer menu+ prompt service and fun hosts+ not very noisy for a restaurant+ cozy beer garden+ fun bowling alley in the basement+ metro train right next door Average entrée: EUR 18Credit cards accepted.Mon-Sun from 5pm"
4,"My husband and I had such an amazing meal here a few nights ago. We are big fans of Lebanese food and this place took the cuisine to a totally new place for us. The staff was friendly and nice as could be...so very welcoming! And the food!!!! Best falafel ever! Delicous assortment of mezze, each one looked and tasted so yummy. My eggplant main was the dish of my dreams and my husband had the duck with fig carpaccio and loved all of the different flavors, especially the cinnamon rice with roasted cashews on the side. Were the shotglasses filled with chilled anise flavoured liquor terrific? Yes indeed! Was the mint sorbet and the panna cotta the best way to end a fantastic meal? Absolutely!"
4,"Exploring lunch options in the neighborhood, I came here because it was the highest rated place on Yelp. And rightfully so. Turns out it's actually more of a breakfast place, but that's okay. The service is very friendly. (I didn't feel like I was bothering the staff with my money, as is often the case in Hamburg.) The lady behind the counter was really cool. Although breakfast was over and some items were sold out, she told me what they had available and helped me pick something. The spinach quiche sounded good. And it was! Himalaya salt and black pepper at hand, it left me wanting another. Alas! The price was a bit steep at 4.50€. However it came with a simple side salad with fresh, beautiful looking vegetables and balsamic vinaigrette. I appreciate the effort; too many places are serving premix salads nowadays.I don't usually order filter coffee (prefer cafe crema/ americano) but my pocket change was limited today and it was the cheapest option. It came served with *warmed-up* milk on the side (nice detail) and a little biscotti. It also tasted good! Ok, Filter Coffee. You get a second chance.The locals are diverse. Great people watching from the window seats. The atmosphere is nice, cozy, and not overly cute as is the trend lately. The music is also pretty great. They picked some local station that plays many classics among other current pop hits from around Europe.I can't find anything against this place. The prices are acceptable considering that quality items and friendly service seem to be primary concerns here. 5 stars earned. I'll definitely come back."
3,"In the summer this place seems to be coming into its own. Sitting outside in the square with a huge and excellently made goats cheese salad was extremely enjoyable. It may not be as cool as sitting inside with the trendy design and the big picture windows, but when the sun is out you need to grab it while you can. As well as the excellent salad there seems to be good choice of pasta. I am told the coffee is good as well, but haven't tried it - yet! Highly recommended as a enjoyable but fast lunch spot."
3,"Having moved recently near to this location we finally were able to try it out. I had heard of the place fairly soon after it opened but the opportunity to visit simply didn't present itself. Well, now it had.There has been enough written about this location in German so I won't go into too many specifics. High-end location with lots of windows. Modern design with well spaced out tables. I found the ambiance and seating comfortable. Service was top notch while we were there and everyone who came by out table was extremely professional. The food itself was also top notch. We had sushi and everything was of the best quality and very well prepared. I liked the selection and found the prices to be representative of the quality as well as area. Yes, it's kind of expensive but what do you expect in Eppendorf and when it's Henssler? All in all, a very good experience and we'll be back. I left out one star simply because this place does lack a bit of soul. It's definitely all good in terms of food, service, location etc. but somehow I didn't get the feeling that this is place which will have lots of regulars and will be used as a ""hang out"" for the inside crowd. Somehow Steffen's place down by the docks has a better vibe to it (be that vibe good or bad). Ono just hasn't come into it's own at this point. Maybe it will and if so, I will update my review. Until then, I am looking forward to grabbing sushi here again soon."
3,"Elegant Italian fine dining restaurant along the Hamburg riverfront. Parking is a short walk away. Delicious food plated gorgeously. Good white wine. Attentive, efficient service! Bravo!My whitefish was 2 generous filets with crispy skin. The accompanying vegetables and mashed potatoes were also yummy. My friend has a large portion of steak which he enjoyed tremendously."
3,"Ah Roschinsky's.. it's another of the almost identical bars on that side of Hamburger Berg. That mean's it's actually a pretty good bar, but you could just as easily pick any of 5-10 bars within 50 yards and have the same evening. - popular music? check.- dance floor? check.- cheap(ish) drinks? check.- good crowd? check.- free entry? check.- table football? check."
3,"I was hanging out with my freinds and suddenly saw this coffee shop in the another side of the street .The impression of me about it is the concept , which is minimal , bright and cute xD. As i went in , the smells of coffee beans rushed in my noé, so delightfully ! No complaint about the staffs , very gentle and friendly."
4,"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the Schanze, definitely my favourite Greek restaurant. I remember coming here a while ago on a Friday night after work with a couple of colleagues and they told me straight away that I should have Gyros mit Pommes because it was delicious andit didn't fail the expectations! After that first time I've been here a few times more, never bothered to try something else  apart from Gyros mit Pilsen & Pommes, which wasn't as awesome as I expected but still really tasty.Prices are definitely ok, you must pay cash which is not unusual in Hamburg, and the service is the best I've experienced and I remember of. They're always super bizy but somehow they always manage not to screw up and to bring you food after a reasonable waiting time, so props. Last couple of things worth mentioning: 1) they've got a couple of TVs inside, so you can watch Bundesliga or Champions League games and 2) if you pay at the counter you're usually asked if you want some Ouzowhich comes for free! :-) I'll come back here over and over again."
3,"Good coffee,  sandwiches,  and yogurts close to Marriott Hotel and much better value. Plenty of space and friendly staff."
4,"This doesn't look like much but boy is the food good. True authentic north Indian cuisine. Even had a kingfisher with my meal. You get a large portion of food for a very good price; the thalis which includes rice, yoghurt, some lentil sauce and your curry of choice cost between 6 and 8 euros which is really good.They also have lots of deserts on sales each costing 0.8. We each got a couple different ones and tried them. Unfortunately I don't remember most names but I wasn't a fan of the milk cake. Worth noting the staff speak both English and German."
3,"After a visit and concert at the Elbphilharmonie we dined with a group in the private dining room. The food and service were excellent. Don't expect cutting edge food, just beautifully cooked and presented classic French cuisine, a salad starter , a slow cooked beef daube with herbed potato mash and a sublime creme caramel. Coffee was a caffeine hit short black. Wines matched well."
4,"Holy cow!  What a great meal. We were off to a rough start with a small language barrier and seating. (We we're asked to change tables twice). But it really didn't matter in the end because everyone was great. The restaurant is small and got very busy. You should make reservations. The food was excellent and fresh. Kudos to the staff that seemed all family, but I'm not sure. Go here if you are in the area."
0,"If you are Vietnamese and looking for good viet food, don't come here. Not only was the waitress rude but the food did not taste one bit Vietnamese. I asked the waitress if she spoke Vietnamese and she looked at me like I said something disrespectful. And when I asked for the check, she yelled at one of her employees to bring it to me in German. But hey, what do you expect by getting Vietnamese food in Germany.Zero stars"
4,"Bleeuggh. I was clearly here, since my phone checked me in and I have photos to prove it. However having followed the crowds down at 5.30 am following all night Chelsea-beating-Bayern revelry I don't remember much about it!What I DO remember though was Queen Mary 2 gliding by at 6am plus being saved by about a pint of hot cappuccino poured into me an hour later. So many people there for the Fischmarket  thousands were there even at sunrise on Sunday!"
4,"Food is great, taste good, but not authentic. The service puts it over the top, you can't find good service like this anywhere outside of the US. The service here is even better than the US Vietnamese restaurants."
2,The coffee and breads here are superb but coffee temperature is below mine thoughts! All staffs are friendly....Ofen I go with my friends
4,"CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!Yes, this is a chocolate lover's dream. It's a chocolate museum and factory with a large specialty chocolate shop attached. Hachez chocolate is the magic brand that runs this museum and boy, is it amazing.They have few tours in English (as well as other languages, depending on the season) so make sure you get one in your preferred language as it's a word-heavy tour and you won't understand much if you don't have a full grasp of German. If you have a larger group, you can always contact them for private tours.I've been three times and every time the tour guides were lovely and super excited (who wouldn't be, working with chocolate all day) and very knowledgable. They walk you trough the history of cocoa and chocolate first, you may even get to try a raw, unprocessed cocoa bean straight from the pod! They taste surprisingly citrussy, actually. Not like cocoa at all, or at least the processed cocoa we're accustomed to.Then you're led into their labratory! Which is a large kitchen area where you get to decorate your own bar of chocolate. Upon buying your tour ticket, you can also pay for an extra bar (one bar is included with every entry ticket) and it's well worth it. I get the extra bar every time and make one for a friend or family member.They use high quality milk chocolate and there's a huge selection of toppings for you to use, from sprinkles over gummy bears to praline crumble, coconut flakes and chocolate chips, nuts and more. You get to fully customize how much and what you want to put on your chocolate bar(s).After your visit to the laboratory, it's off to the second part of the tour. Here you find out how the process of making raw cocoa beans into actual chocolate works. You're introduced to all methods and machinery and get to sample a lot of the products on the way. And by sample I absolutely mean pig out as they're really generous with their samples if you're nice about it!After the tour concludes you get to wrap your hand decorated bar of chocolate yourself and take it home with you. If it makes it home before ending up in your stomach, that is.The tour might seem a bit on the expensive side, but it's worth every single penny and more. I come back here way too often..."
3,"This Indian restaurant defines exactly what needs to be important to stay in business in competitive Food industry. This is very well placed restaurant, just 5 mins walk away from Railway Station. It doesn't have any super decorative stuff or some light show on the outside, but still it's not very difficult to find. I shouldn't actually call it a restaurant, but it's more of self service Diner. No fancy decorations or extra comfortable seats to make you sit there for really long time, some light music, everything is surprising. But the best part is food. No Hocus Pokus or 20 pages Menu which makes consumer's life very easy. Food is really very good with prices worth to make student's life easy. I really liked the Lamb Curry there. It's highly recommended. The restaurant also has many varieties of Indian sweets for take away. The food is served in traditional Indian Plates called Thali which was a nostalgic experience - reminded me of Langar (practice common to few Indian religions of community eating). I feel happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys and loves food (while ignoring the ambiance)## The place if often really crowded, which is always the best sign. ##"
4,"Ok, this is official. Milch is my favorite coffee place in Hamburg now. Flat white is amazing good."
0,Do not reserve tables online. We arrived with a reservation and they were full. Refused us a table even though I showed the reservation on my phone. We reserved several nights in advance for our last night on our vacation and ended up with having a burger instead!
3,"One of my favorite gluten free Italian restaurant in Hamburg! Oh yes, they can make real gluten free food and of course, normal gluten meals. All of them r quite tasty, especially meat dishes and pastas. Absolutely great service, but sometimes because of too many customs eating there. U might need to wait for a while. Love their decoration style and music!"
3,Great place for an evening stroll or a nice day in the sun. Flowers are abundant in spring and summer with well maintained grounds with plenty of places to sit. A huge playground for the kiddies is a must do if you have a little one along for the ride. Date night has an interesting opportunity with evening fountain and light shows during the summer. This city hideaway feels like its miles from everything while being minutes from most.
4,"Excellent vegetarian food! Great tastes to experience, well-made food. Service was a bit slow, but the food was well worth it! Also a nice seating area outside."
4,"I go to Jim Burrito at least once a month and I've never been disappointed with the food!Now that they reorganised the restaurant the service is even quicker. The decoration and the atmosphere are great, the music is cool (often rock).Huge pro: They have 3 menus- omnivorous- vegetarian- veganI recommend the quesadillas (served with guaca, sour cream, salsa and salad) or burritos if you are reeeeeaaally hungry"
0,"Mice in the restaurant, unfriendly host - not recommended!This was my 3rd time at L'Osteria at Opernplaza/Dammtorstrasse in Hamburg and by far the worst experience.The host that greeted us was unkind and rude when we suggested to wait at the bar for our table. He lectured us that we would take away seats for other customers - well, we just wanted to wait for table - go figure....Anyways, the worst part was the mice that were running around in the restaurant. When we told the waitress she waived our concerns away, telling us this would be common in the inner city. I wonder what the Hamburgian health department's opinion is on this topic...This said, this was my last visit since the pizza was mediocre as well."
3,"sehr lecker, leider lassen die Toiletten zu wünschenaber das essen ist super. nicht dieses Standard glutamat China essen von um der Ecke"
3,"Looks like I'm going to have to go ahead and edit my review again, bringing Viale Antico back up to 4 stars. The service seems to have gone back to it's original, snappy self - I guess last summer wasn't a good time for them. Their prices, however, have remained higher than they originally were. I haven't gone back with a large party so I'm not sure how they'll handle more than a few people, but I've been coming here once a week with one or two lunch-mates and the service has been friendly and snappy. I like that at Viale Antico I can order whatever I want - regardless of if it's on the menu or not - and I can ask for any modifications of menu items. --- ORIGINAL EDIT --- Unfortunately I'm going to have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant to two stars. In the past few months, the quality of service has dropped dramatically and the prices of the dishes have increased. More times than not, two or more of our party have been receiving their dish considerably later (up to 40min) than the rest of us and the staff has been rude to us, which provides for an uncomfortable and nerve-wrecking lunch experience. At this point in time I cannot recommend Bistro Viale Antico. --- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW --- Bistro Viale Antico is across the street from the new Qype HQ on Deichstrasse. We strolled upon it accidentally this afternoon as a part of our lunch-hour-wander, to find restaurants in the area. I ordered the Scampi pasta, which was probably one of the better Scampi pastas I've had. Most other restaurants drench the spaghetti in sauce and throw in a few scampis. The pasta I received had a very light garlic/butter sauce with fresh herb seasoning and had plenty of scampi. The price was reasonable. 7.50eu is what I paid for my dish, which is higher than I'm accustomed to, but the quality of the service and food was much higher than I am accustomed to, as well."
3,It's a really nice bar with happy hours to some coctails. And they have also nice coffee and few cakes which I didn't try. You could sit outside.
3,"Don't get rid of the October Spacial Salad!!! It is amazing, made me come for the first time when I was in Zurich and back several times in Hamburg for it!!!"
3,"The smallest venue Ive probably ever been to- so small you have to exit and wait out front when bands are setting up their gear on stage- which can be rather cold in the winter... Cool little place under the railway lines which generally has shows from local or small bands on tour- 6 Euros will usually get you in a show- which is a great way to discover new music in a cool environment. The Astra Stube seems like a Hamburg instuition of sorts and they almost had to close this December, but were able to extend their lease for a few more years- so go support local/independent live music!"
4,"Utterly charming, and obviously -- people know! My husband and I were taking a stroll around beautiful Hamburg on our last day, and happened to find ourselves faced with a 2 hour wait at the Miniature Museum (next time). A quick pop of the Yelp app and we found ourselves at Ti Breizh devouring gorgeous crepes within a few minutes. Now, this was midday on a Sunday -- it obviously gets very busy and is very popular, so typically reservations are recommended. This Breton-inspired, white wash wood interiored gem was just what we needed after a long night and heavy morning of walking. I chose the Nordic savoury crepe with loads for smoked salmon and fresh dill. Mmmmm, so nice. Served with a nice side salad. Though we weren't toting our toddler, it did some very kid friendly (at this hour anyway) with several children at most of the tables near us. Kid chairs available and by nature, crepes are very child approved! There's a small shop in the front selling clothing that fits the theme (ALL stripes), unfortunately they closed before I could finish eating so I didn't get a chance to peek around. I likely would've bought something, too. 5-stars easily -- sometimes there is a reason a place is so popular, and the reason at Ti Breizh is because it is fantastic. Next time -- dessert crepes with nutella and wine for days. Delightful."
4,"While visiting my friend's father for the weekend, we walked around the block to this restaurant for lunch. It was great, fresh ingredients, well prepared food, and friendly service. So good we went back for dinner the next night, equally fantastic. It's clearly popular with the locals (who ought to know!) as the place was completely full on a Tuesday night. Highly recommended. Price was reasonable too!"
3,"We found the restaurant on Yelp, of course.     We are 3 Germans, 1 Ecuadorian and 1 from the US. (Yes, it's Election Day but I voted early.).  Three of the pastas were excellent; 2 were good.  (The pumpkin ravioli was amazing.). The wine was very good-- we had red and white. The Tiramisu was excellent and the créame caramel was nice."
3,"Very nice shop for sweet treats such as cakes, cookies and uniquely decorated cupcakes! The pastel colors of this shop and white wooden tables, along with dainty cottage like furniture gives it a cute, sweet treat feel, which makes sense since it is a dessert shop!I like how they have pre-wrapped treats that you can buy to go or give as a gift.  They also sell jars of marmalade for your convenience in seal tight glass canisters, which would be great to use again at home for spices or whatnot.  I have a friend named Max, so I buy him cute gifts from here 'just because'There is a cooler with ice-cream as well upfront but I believe they specialize more in pastry type delights, and there are plenty of other italian Eis spots to get great ice-cream on this street if you feel like having a scoop of sweet flavored coolness on a cone.I bought the chocolate cookies and a jar of marmalade :) I also love their homemade cakes.  Try them if you need a special Birthday cake!They also have wifi for mobile addicted customers, and so you can check in on Yelp!"
4,It is a pretty friendly environment with lots of options of coffee and cake-desert mixtures. Even dough there are available place for sitting around 50-70 people you will be in need of waiting a bit(aprox.5-15 min). I tried their late- macchiato - delicious -made of some kind of Rwanda origin beans. Hint: If you sit in those bar chairs a bit later your back hurts so try to get a table sitting option. Pretty good location btw- if you couldnt find anywhere at schanze or before going there after Sternschanze subway station have a break here.Highly recommended.
3,"When in Sternchanze, Herr Max is one of the must-do's.Because you will want to.It's a little shop/café with homemade pastry offering a selection of freshly self-made cookies, tarts, cupcakes and cakes, each day slightly different ones. You can take it away (and buy one of their delicious marmalades of quite extravagant tastes, too)or please sit in, if you find a nice corner.Within its white and pastel tiled wall you'll find yourself in vintage furniture with grandma-style dishes and cutlery (but it's your stily granny)The girls behind the counter are lovely and make 1st class coffeewalk in hide from the rain and enjoy some cake and watch the world walk by its windows!"
4,"What can you say about experiencing something that people have to do in their day to day lives? an eye-opener? an enlightening experience? yes, these apply, but also added to this is a really well thought through few hours, and (is this wrong?) good fun. With comments from my group when entering into the pitch darkness of ""my sweetheart, you look nice today"" to falling over the marketstalls and basically being run-over on the fake street, we all had a great time. We learnt a lot by talking to our guides, had a beer in a pitch black restuarant and came out being a bit more broad-minded. a fantastic time, and well recommended to all..."
4,"Really good dürum- I Stan this bitch. It was juicy, dry everything u would want in a durum."
3,"Great place. Nice view to the B+V docks, good variety of drinks, nice food. Stinky toilets."
3,"Ay Carumba! Casa Franco is so much fun. I came here last night with some friends and I had a great time. For 27 euros you get a four-course meal complete with a flaming scallop starter, fish, more fish, and a delicious dessert. Mmm. The owner of the restaurant is fantastic. He's so attentive to his customers and makes a huge effort to entertain the entire restaurant. We got several free shots of alcohol and the entire restaurant toasts together. The atmosphere is cozy, festive, and lively. There was even a traditional guitar singer that serenaded us twice in the night. My favorite part of my four course meal was the parrot fish and the crème brûlée-like dessert. I'm not sure what it was, but it was GOOD. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was 22 euros a bottle. I'd say the style of the food was Portuguese fusion. The fun part is that the chef decides what you will eat so you don't have to order your food. The fish that he served us was extremely fresh. I think this is a great place to go with some friends or to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday. At the end of the meal, the owner also gives the ladies a single rose. :) Four solid stars for the food, and 7 stars for the service. I'll most likely be back!"
4,"No printed menu that I ever saw. A blackboard that looks to be updated daily on the wall. I took the waiters recommendation for what to have. Antipasti to share, secondi of pasta with truffles and entree of fresh grilled sea bass that he promised he would bone out. Really good. Never would have ordered that without his recommendation. My dining companion had homemade ravioli topped with white truffles. He was very happy. Good service that moved along but didn't feel rushed. Very reasonable prices for what we had. Under 100€ for two with three courses and drinks. This is a very small but popular dining place. It might be hard to sit and talk and just drink.  But there are other choices near by for that. Just dine here first!"
3,"The food was good, we ordered the schanke and the steak. Both was really good. We ordered the apfelstrudeln as dessert and this we can recommend. The reason for the 4 star is that we had to wait for 45min for the main dishes. That was a long wait for the relatively simple dishes. This is of course disputable, but that's how we felt. The strudeln came after 15min too. The check? Guess what, it came in with a minute."
4,"The chicken donër is amazing. I recommend getting both the chili sauce and the yogurt, the combination packs a little heat with a refreshing cool. The meat, bread, flavors... everything was delicious and only €4. I would have gladly paid double for something so good. The lunch line can get long but it moves relatively fast. I was in and out in a matter of 5 minutes.It was exactly what I have been craving for the last.... couple of years from a time when I ate way too many street kebabs in Montmartre. I will definitely be back again."
3,"Yes it's true: it's a beach club in the middle of town. Complete with sand, chairs, ping pong and more (but no volleyball, sigh...)Yelp turned me in to this and because I needed a chill vibe and uncomplicated food st reasonable prices I came here. No Chardonnay but I made do with a Pinot Grigio. The next stand over o ordered the Curry Wurst and Pommes with Mayo. Nice large portion of all and the Curry Wurst was tasty but I'm not used to the sweet-sour glaze it swam in. One drawback...no cards. Cash only and you don't know that before you order. I guess I really should get used to asking that ahead of time because I keep running into that. But there are places you just expect to be able to use a card and a restaurant is just one of those. I can see how this place would be packed on a summer afternoon or weekend. Too fun!"
2,"So many people had recommended Herr Max to us, so I looked forward to breakfast here.We ordered two different breakfasts, two coffee and two orange juices and the girls working here totally mixed it all up and forgot half of our order. When we finally got it all it both looked and tasted really good, and the café is really charming as well. I wish that I could give the café a better ranking, but unfortunately I found the service too bad for that. The girls forgot orders, ran around looking stressed behind the counter and had no order in what they were doing. And that's just stressful to watch as a customer, even if the food/cakes are good."
4,"Sure they started a bit shaky, but after a few months of working through the kinks and finding some great cooks these guys nailed it. Perfect food, casual attitude, good service, and good location. A+"
1,"Super unimpressed with this place. We were expecting so much more since the concept was appealing and a bit of hype had been dispensed about this place. Unfortunately, the concept falls flat on its face. Currently still a trendy spot and hence fairly full at most meal times. We showed up and were given two cards and asked to wait at the bar. There is no system though to getting seated and people who came after us were seated before us. We also weren't given seats across from one another as requested but instead were seated next to one another in a bench seat area which was way too small to squeeze into as it was abutted up on to the wall next to it. Finally, once seated, everyone is so close that every word you utter is within earshot of six other people. Intimate seating for sure....if you want to be intimate with everyone around you. The ordering process is also quite inefficient. In hindsight, as two people, we should of ordered everything on one machine and with one card. Maybe that way the drinks would of come at the same time and thereafter the food. Instead we both used our own tablet and ended up having drinks and food all come at varied times. I was done with mine when my wife's arrived. Same with the burgers. Finally, the food ended up being OK. I've had far better burgers but these weren't necessarily bad. Yet they weren't anything more than mediocre when you take all the competition which has arrived on the scene in Hamburg. The drinks were also OK. Beer is beer but the home made ""drinks"" with creative uses of basil, etc. were a bit ""off"". Nevertheless, we experienced the place and are happy to have seen it but the experience fell flat and we won't be back."
1,"I know salt is cheap but how much you need to put into the dishes? I really can't tolerate it, way beyond my average intake. I think the food is authentic indian food, unfortunately I can't enjoy it. By the way, service is awful. When I asked for a vegetarian dish recommendation, I immediately get impatience from the waiter. I know they don't live on tips like being in America, but come on, I'm a customer and what I got right back from him to my husband is ""She's difficult""The two star is for the atmosphere"
0,"So after five months in Hamburg, I was finally overcome by my desire for a decent burger. Where would I go? I decided to go to The Bird after studying reviews on Tripadvisor and on other fora. In the end it all comes down to the meat, the bun, the cheese, the fries. They're a friendly, well intentioned bunch, but the vast lump of churned meat at the core of The Bird just does come up to standard when it comes to taste or texture. There is no 'bite', it's almost as if the meat has been reduced to the texture and feel of sausage meat. Perhaps they are catering to local tastes. Perhaps there are constrained by local produce. I don't know the reason. I would love to have been able to give them a good review. I would have loved to have had a reliable burger on my new doorstep. But I am afraid that the guys down at The Bird, friendly though they are, just do not know how to make a burger, their core product. Sorry."
3,"Trendy, cozy, chilled. Several standard drinks served on a high quality level make your night at this place. Enjoy yourself and your crew in between well off people of any age. The music is easy to listen and even if the place is crowded it is quite easy to keep talking and even more important listening ;-) The bartenders are really pros and they give you the drinks in a good mood and in a very reasonable time. You are looking for a place for a easy evening? Then this is the place you should truly consider.One star is missing because service time is reasonable, not best effort at any time."
3,"I have walked by this place many times, an I guess I was too busy window shopping to notice this restaurant! Breakfast all day?! And I didn't know about it!? That is a crime. I ordered the French Breakfast at 15:00. It came with two buttery croissants, jam, nutella and honey. I had a sweet tooth, and this ""breakfast"" definitely cured it.  The juice was fabulous. Maracuja (passion fruit), orange and strawberry. Unfortunately the little fruit flies also know that they use fresh fruit in their juices, and they enjoy hanging around for a taste.  Will be back, especially to try other juices."
4,"Amazing! this place has 5 stars on Yelp and deserves it. This place really goes back to the basics, you eat in a tent and the menu is on a chalk board. Very traditional German is served here. I had a Wiener Schnitzel with fried potatoes. When he brough my plate out I could not believe how huge the schnitzel was and how many potatoes I got.The guy did not really speak English but was very helpful non the less he made sure I like it and even asked a passerby to help when I ordered to make sure he got my order right!At the end he told me desert was included! I got rice pudding that was simple but good. I don't even know how I had room left to eat it.All of that and a drink and my whole meal was less than 10 euros!Go for sure if you are in Hamburg!!"
4,"I agree with Andrew, A meat eaters paradise. I'm surprised to read that no one has reviewed the peppercorn steak special, this steak at a low price of 13.95, come with a salad, green beans and baked potato as well. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! the steak was great, their housemade sour cream made the potato. The salad arrived shortly after our beers. Our server was so kind, always smiling and he read my mind when i was craving more sourcream."
2,"Here we go, finally I get to review Ti Breizh. I have been to this restaurant on three separate occasions, twice for workday lunch, and once with family during the weekend. The galettes and crêpes are excellent and traditional. I have always gone with the daily menu consisting of one savory galette and on dessert crêpe. Yesterday was a galette with cooked ham, spinach and roquefort sauce, very tasty. The menu crêpe was chocolate and coconut.So the food is really tasty, and I even want to go back for it. Why 3 stars you ask? Service. This restaurant is so incredibly slow. Yesterday it didn't look too busy, but it took us one hour and 15 minutes from our arrival to our departure. And this was after asking two different waiters to have our crêpes come faster as we had a meeting to attend. This is just not cool for a workday lunch.Get your act together Ti Breizh and make your service go faster than a (French) snail. You deserve more than 3 stars."
4,"YES. YES. YES. This is the best wurst in Hamburg without a doubt. My mother grew up in Hamburg and agrees wholeheartedly, so you know it's good. I worked in the area, which was both a blessing and a curse. You'd think after the 20th time visiting that I would get nauseous at the sight of another Thüringer, Bockwurst or Bratwurst, but the closer I got, the faster my heart would beat, the louder my tummy would rumble, and the more my mouth would water. I was addicted. The currywurst is supposedly their specialty, but I don't like my wurst swimming in sauces. Still worth a try if that's what you're into! Otherwise I'd recommend the Thüringer or Bratwurst with fries!"
2,"Boyfriend and I are from America visiting Hamburg - If you're looking for something fast, cheap, and decent (taste wise) then this is a good spot. The food is definitely filling. We got the chicken durum. It wasn't anything to write home about...given the fact that we didn't have time, we wanted something quick. Would I go back again? Only if I was in a time crunch and needed to eat something quick and not to mention really cheap too! Not my favorite but not bad either. Also, not sure the customs in the area, but the same person that prepared our sandwich (without gloves) also handled our money and gave us change back without cleaning hands."
3,"Delightful small Italian restaurant in an unremarkable spot near Rodingsmarkt UBahn. High tables with red and white checkered tablecloths lead off the open kitchen, giving it a very ""homecooking"" sort of feel. I can only comment on the pizzas so far - but they were superb. Perfect thin crispy bases with very generous toppings. And the service is delightful - we were definitely being ""mothered"" by the wonderful lady of the house."
4,"The name is program! I have been here already twice this months and I have to say that the steaks are awesome. The Prime Cut Filet is very tender and definitely worths a try. Friends enjoyed the New York Strip and Rib Eye very much as well. Looking at the sides, I am recommending the leaf spinach and potatoes. Besides, they selection of wines is good. PS: not sure why other people write about cheese burger I haven't seen any on the menu!"
2,"My local restaurant.  The food is good the drinks are great, it's just the service which could improve.  I like an experience and warmth.  As a business owner, feelings are everything.The basil smash is nice if you like interesting herby cocktails! If you're around here, Holla at me"
4,"Omg I love their non-alcoholic cocktails! The best I ever have had and I will never forget the 'summer love' (yogurt, mango, white chocolate syrup, maracuja and cranberry juice) and 'kiwi twist virgin' which was pretty sweet but sooo tasty. Their food is amazing as well and I will definitely come back again in their happy hours because the drinks are big and affordable!Venue:Great for groups but it's pretty loud after working hours!  Loud, mainstream club music and a weird mixture of business ppl and youngsters. Not really a restaurant but a nice place to have drinks before you go clubbing!"
2,"It is kind of sad that in a city like Hamburg, where so many restaurants and shops offer fish, it seems to be impossible to get some really good fish and chips.Henssler is no exception.I can not say anything about any of the dishes you can get inside the restaurant. I just wanted fish and chips to take away. And it wasn't bad. But that is all. And from a name like Henssler, one would expect a bit more.Maybe Hamburg simply isn't the place for a simple portion of fish and chips. If you really want that, wait till you get to Travemünde for example. Had fish and chips in a small and extremely simple restaurant in the port of Travemünde and was surprised by the way better quality than that of Henssler at a lower price."
2,"Today around lunchtime I was there for the Halloween treats. Sadly the spooky cupcakes weren't ready then. But still the owner made us 5 boxes of the things - after a few special pleads.They didn't get decorated as creatively as we thought and there were only 2 different kinds (banana and raspberry) on offer but we still liked them. Very sweet and colourful things coming in a cute little pink cardboard box. A very girlish affair altogether, I'd say. 5 Euro for a box of 2 of the candy buggers. And man, they tasted very, very sweet as well, phew.Nice stuff but honestly not too breath-taking and just too sweet. And after all the are only pimped muffins ;) But I like this special Halloween event so why not go and find out for yourself. They are open until 23h tonite."
3,"This was a pleasant surprise. Even after having read the other reviews, I was not prepared for the sheet size an ingenuity of the whole thing.  Floor after floor of painstakingly detailed models, with some really funny details here an there. Especially the airport is worthwhile to spend some time admiring the lifelike planes and vehicles, including the specific sounds that each plane makes. Quite incredible!"
4,"Kardelen must be doing something right to have a line out the door at lunch every day of the week. And I think it's a great place for casual Turkish food, too, but I have to admit that I'm a little puzzled about why it's so popular. The menu is incredibly long. This is mostly because they serve a handful of foods (Döner meat, falafel, veggies, various casseroles) in various formats (plates, wraps, sandwiches), and every single permutation is on the menu.The food itself is really good, and everything is prepared at the moment you order it, so you can customize as you like with sauces and other special requests. I usually get a Döner in bread or in a wrap (durum), but the other dishes look great, too. As mentioned, there is always a huge line. However, they are good at moving orders quickly, and even getting a seat in the packed dining room isn't all that hard. I do wish they were less popular and had more space/capacity, but that's just part of the Kardelen experience."
3,"Great location with a greater view. The atmosphere is cozy. My dish was very good, the other that we ordered was medium. However- it is a great place to go and see Hamburg from above. Be sure to make a reservation. Our waitress was fantastic and we felt good there."
1,"For my (maybe spoilt?) liking sadly the most boring breakfast throughout the whole Schanze. I refer to the Kostbar süß (sweet) now which had the character of a loveless canteen meal: tiny plastic packs of honey (1), Nutella (1), jam (1), cream cheese (1) and butter (1) slapped on a plate.Plus 2 biiiiig, flavourless rolls and a tragic slice of tomato, melon and cucumber. For the price of this (approx. 5 Euro without a coffee) I've had many much better breakfasts around town. Quite a letdown being only topped off by the bored and inattentive waitress. (- And they follow this pattern during the summertime, too, when you wish to sip a beer outside You could do a runner five times until these girls come to collect your money or orders.)"
4,So good... one of the best Mexican restaurants in Hamburg! Delicious food and welcoming service.
4,"This bar seems little on the outside, but turns out to be pretty big on the inside. Besides the two regular rooms with cute tables and picknick chairs, theres another room in the back, just as big, great in case it gets crowded. The sunday breakfast buffet is probably the best Ive seen since living in Hamburg. Everything you can think of having for breakfast, big chance they offer it in here! And, last but not least, its affordable! I definitely will come back here, as my friends also recommend this place during the week, on every day evenings. Great to grab a bite, coffee, breakfast or relaxing afternoon!"
3,"My usual usage of Irish pubs is based on large TV screens and football - with little else of merit, so I approached the Irish Rover with trepidation. But this is an Irish pub as it should be: Dark, cosy, welcoming, friendly, Kilkenny and Guinness on tap and good solid food! In particular the Guinness was as good as it gets outside Dublin and the fish and chips comes with real chips (not frites, not french fries, CHIPS!!). The clientele was a mix of ex pat Brits and Irish and young Germans. Always a good sign. You would take a place like this for granted in Dublin or London. But for this frequently travelling Brit finding a good traditional pub in Hamburg whose attraction is based on good beer, food and company, was a real joy."
3,What a lovely place.Excellent price value ratio!!We had seafood only!Catch of the day was wonderful.Some very good wines from Portugal and Spain. Quick and friendly service!Location in the heartbeat of Hamburg (Schanze)
4,"I'm from New York and was looking for a healthy place to get a salad and Daily You is by far my favorite place to eat in Hamburg. Everything is tasty, cheap, and high quality. The chili is very good. The salad bowls are all excellent. I've had both the teriyaki chicken bowl and tofu bowl and both were great. I'd recommend asking for them with lettuce if you want to skip the rice, but either way is good. The pasta bolognese is also very good and comes with an amazingly large portion of protein. The staff were extremely helpful (we only speak English) and the food came out fast. Would definitely recommend."
2,"We went here twice in one day!  For dinner was actually because a handful of other restaurants seemed to be closed and we wanted a menu with a variety of menu options.  Earlier that Monday the whole team went here for lunch.  My german team told us that the pizzas here are huge, so one of my collagues and I shared a caprese pizza (they gave us both one half).  I enjoyed the fresh table bread they provided.  Service during the day was better than when we went at night.  The caprese pizza was alright, but had just one small little ball of mozzarella and one teeny basil leaf on each slice.  I would have expected more.  As others have mentioned, the toppings are on the sparse side.  I also ordered a side salad, so I only ended up eating one slice of pizza and taking the rest to go.When we came back for dinner later that night, they were very busy but we were able to get a table by the door.  I had ordered a tomato shrimp gnocchi dish, the girls had ordered an artichoke cream soup and a special crawfish pasta.  We all ended up sharing even though my main dish was the gnocchi.  The portions here are huge again, even more so with the pasta.  The gnocchi were very pillowy and filling.  I actually enjoyed the light cream sauce crawfish pasta more, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish.  And the artichoke cream soup was refreshing.  Again, since they were so busy, we had to keep asking for several things.  But it's honestly not a bad option for a cheap Italian meal.  Dishes top around 12-13 Euro."
2,"A great location, amazing view, but it can be a lot more. The food and drinks are totally overpriced for the service that is offered. We were in a group of people watching a soccer game at the place. Not only there was a lack of tvs on the roof terrace but also they just managed to hang the tvs on the walls barely on time since ""the owner took the key home, where the tvs were stored"". The menu was an A4 laminated piece of paper which I found totally inadequate for a place where you pay on average 10 EUR per drink. Not only was the staff completely rood and unfriendly they also overcharged us on the bill and made fun of the fact that we were an english speaking group and did not tip them for the reasons stated above. The food was ""ok"" but 3,50 per shrimp on your ceaser salad -  I found ridiculous. All in all sh#t service and an amazing location. I dont usually do this, but I just couldnt help myself. I hope that the owner improves this, since that place can be a lot more. Might come back in a year, not any time soon."
3,"Part lobster and fish dealer, part seafood canteen - Hummer (lobster) Pedersen is an institution down in the commercial fish market area.Seating is casual and busy, service efficient; patrons at lunch are a mix of business people from the neighboring office buildings and tourists.Dishes are simple (think fried fish with potatoes; oysters with some shallots at the side; tuna tartare; plain cooked and opened lobster with hot butter at the side) and effective for it. Their wines are very well selected. All at not cheap, but very fair prices.Do yourself a favor and eat here rather than at the garage-style fish roll outlets up the street who will probably even serve their spiny lobster with crude mayonnaise and french fries at the same price..."
3,"Bok have built up quite a chain of restaurants around Hamburg. In Altona there are two and in Schanze I think they have 6(!). Obviously this means they're doing something right. The food is mostly Thai, but I think most of their places serve a variety of asian dishes. For instance there is normally some Sushi on the menu. This particular Bok is a self-service one - meaning that you queue at a counter, place and order and then wait for your number to come up. Personally I much prefer this to their restaurant experience. It's a bit cheaper, much faster, but just as good food. Hmm, I really should comment on the food. It's good without being great, if I'm honest. One of those places that you're always happy to eat at, but perhaps you're not going to go out of your way to go to."
4,"Awesome bar! The food is very nice and very affordable. The space is a little crammed, but it adds to the charm and the staff (and indeed he patrons) were very nice nice"
4,"Found this restaurant via Yelp and it was an absolute triumph! The food was delicious and was served extremely fast, the service really nice and the decor warm and homey.We had 7 starters and dessert. The Mangold with lemon and oil was delicious. Same goes for the fried fish and grilled octopus. The lamb leg meat melted off and was juicy and flavorful and the bread warm and crunchy. For two hungry people, it was perhaps a little much, but 6 starters would have been perfect Don't forget to add a serving of Tzaziki and finish off with honey cake balls.I would recommend making a reservation. We went Saturday night and if we hadn't called ahead, we wouldn't have found a seat."
4,Very good Mexican cuisine. Portions are large and the food is authentic! Definitely recommend it.
3,Old pharmacy transformed into a student pub. Like the vibe and comparatively low prices. Main drink is beer.
4,Authentic Cantonese food!   Large selection.   We enjoyed both the Dim Sum and dinner dishes.    The Kung Pao Shrimp was especially good.
4,"Awesome Beer, Fantastic Food, perfect environment and a wonderful staff to boot. I love this place and can't say enough positive things about it!"
3,"Very nice little Pizza place in Talstraße, just a few steps away Dron the Reeperbahn. It's definitely not easy to eat inside because of its size (during summer there are some more seats outside though) but pizza is good and quite cheap. Give it a try of you are in the Reeperbahn area and you are hungry!"
2,"I was not happy with the cocktails I ordered: - Moskow Mule the taste was completely off and they did not serve it in a moscow mule mug- Whiskey sour is too sour :)The service was fast and friendly though, the atmosphere was a chillaxing one and the music was just right."
4,Incredible quality coffee. We ordered coffee on ice with hafermilch. It was deliciously creamy with perfect taste of incredible coffee. Nice modern interior! If you crave good quality coffee - this is your spot! I am not a coffee drinker but this one will make me turn into one
1,"Wow, surprised at all the positive reviews here. Some people either have really low standards, or many of these are faked. This place was quite a disappointment. Outside of the decent sized portion of Aioli and bread to kick of the meal, everything else went downhill. I'm almost inclined to give only one star but I've had worse (directly in the area where this restaurant is!) I actually feel that most of the restaurants in the area are horrible and hence the general quality of all is drawn downwards. This place may have had it's prime but is long past it now. Our waiter didn't quite understand the concept of service. The food itself was absolutely mediocre and a day later, I have some serious indigestion from the lamb with garlic dish. Food was thrown on to the table basically when being served to us. The waiter couldn't be bothered to come to our table regularly to check on things and he really didn't care to be nice. The prices are also much too high for what you get. Finally, where I was sitting outside, right next to their entrance, it stank. There was a nasty odor coming from the ground level vent right there. Gosh I hope this wasn't coming from their kitchen. This place may have been good but no more. I'd seriously consider twice if you plan on eating there."
4,"YES! This is the best little gem I was able to find in Hamburg.After being in Germany for a week, I had yet to have my favourite German food, Maultaschen.  I had one day left so quickly took to yelp to find a place that would serve this wonderful thing.Fortunately I came across Zum Spatzle!  We walked in when there were fortunately enough seats to accommodate us.  There are only about 10 tables in the whole restaurant so we were lucky to get a place for 3.This place is run by a one woman band, who takes your order and makes all the food for you.  Situated on a cozy little street, I would definitely recommend for lunch.And get the maultaschen with Egg (Ei).  It is amazing and I promise you you won't regret it."
2,"Maybe I just dreamt that I already reviewed here. Decent location in a nice square by the canal, and popular. The downside is the sometimes painfully slow service, and I've never been overwhelmed by the pasta. I would recommend Rialto, which is just next door. It is stylish though."
3,Cute restaurant with a great ambiance. Feels like it is lit by candles making it warm and welcoming. Get the potato pancakes!
4,"It's like have your personal chef. If you are in Hamburg this is the place. Excellent service, excellent food!"
4,"Alright I'm gonna be honest here: I got into this place purely by accident. I was particularly hungry, tired, and I couldn't be bothered walking any further. I saw the light, I saw the Italian sign and I just decided 'right, that will do!"":)I was seated within less than 10mn by another lonely chap at the nearby table and greeted cheerfully by the staff. It felt really cosy and the place has a really homy atmosphere, with a mix of locals, business customers as well as a few tourists like me.I was provided with the menu but as I probably know 2 words of German, the waiter nicely gave me an overview of what was on offer and made some suggestions. A glass of red wine, truffle Carpaccio and a perfectly cooked filet later, I was full and content :). The food was lovely and the thing that then came to mind at that stage was that it was probably going to cost me an armbut gosh, this was ex-cel-lent italian food!44EUR later:)  No regret here though. This was a lovely Italian restaurant with well cooked and selected food, excellent customer service and I'll certainly recommend it in the future. I really don't have a problem spending money when the whole experience is top notch from start to finish. Plus, let's be honest, I already know the hotel menu off by heart now so a bit of adventure was needed anyway!"
3,Nice selection of cocktails and Mexican dishes. 5 for 33EUR cocktail pack with a different set for guys and girls :) Also nice location to go around the town after dinner\ drinks. Wi-Fi didn't work on my Android phone - a simpler configuration could be better.
3,"We went there with 7 other people, of whose 2 greeks.Very good greek food. Good quality/price ratio :) Service was good and fast.Very noisy though, and the porc is really dry. Get some tzatziki with it :D"
4,Comfortable and minimalistic place with a cozy atmosphere. Friendly waitress and nice coffee and chai latte. Definitely recommendable for a quick pitstop during shopping!
4,"Most delicious tapas. Had a birthday dinner here and I have never had more mussels for 9€. We almost couldn't finish them, but we did. Totally recommend, the house wine is so easy to drink. Love this place!"
4,"One of my favourite Döner places in town. Specifically, I find the service to be super nice. This seems to be family run or at least the folks there have been working together for a while. The food has always impressed us and we personally like the taste. We actually come a bit out of our way to eat here as we don't live in the area. When we are up for a Döner Teller, my wife and I jump in the car to come get one here. They have the standard selection like every other Döner Imbiss but the folks are always nice and there is plenty of traffic in here so that nothing in the store has time to go bad. Further, they make their bread fresh in the store and it's usually still warm from the oven and super tasty. I'm sure everyone has their favourite place when it comes to Döners but this one is ours because of the people. If in the area, stop in and try it out. They have outdoor seating as well for the warmer weather months."
3,"Great vegan restaurant. The food is tasty, the place is cosy and the crew is cool. Best vegan quiche I ever eat !  The blueberry pie is great too.The missing star is for the really slow service : 40 minutes to get my dish."
4,"Cox was recommended by a local. That's clearly the best way. It's a beautify old building. High ceilings, glass open frontage plenty of natural light. No outdoor seating.  They don't need to be trendy, they are intimate and the food speaks for itself (in both a classic and classy way without attitude). I was brought bread with butter and a salt shaker to start. To begin I chose the cold roast beef with fried potatoes and not sure what dressing but oh wow ! Even at this stage it's clear that if I lived locally I would be a regular. This is where you bring a date to impress her (if she's a foodie) trust me it will impress! As I wait for my main I try another piece of bread yes, the salt does enhance the flavour. Also my very attentive waitress steps outside and charmingly slouches against the door frame to peruse the street for a moment before turning and coming back in. I really really like it here! I know I'm not writing a novel here but as I sip my German rose while sitting alone it's impossible not to drink in the atmosphere. The wine is delicious btw. Esp in this humid heat. My main was essentially Fish w beets but the menu listing was more eloquent.  When I was having trouble deciding on my main. When I asked her favourite the waitress said she liked this item because of its freshness. Very apt.  I'm not stopping there. (Btw I Never do 3 courses of dinner!) As I sit here enjoying my own thoughts I notice the couple in the (frosted) window table holding hands. Take note men, That's where you want to sit with your romantic dates. Dessert, well I'm not really a fan I just got carried away. The chocolate sauce and vanilla custard I think it was Accompanying were really delicious. The Tort was nice. Just not really my thing. Although I enjoyed the pastry casing in which it was served and the nutty texture. This was one of my stand out dining experiences in Germany. Highly recommended!"
2,"If anything, this is a wonderful place to lunch or dine outside in the shade of old trees at the end of the Bleickenallee. The choice is also more varied than the run-of-the-mill Italian. My vitello tonnato was excellent and the smell of my companion's tagliatelli with scampi mouthwatering. What a pity that the panna cotta didn't live up to the expectations: it was tough (too much gelatine) and bland in taste (no rasped lemon peel or something else that could have enlivened the taste). Still, overall a good choice"
4,"If you go to Hamburg, even without your kids, you must go visit this place. It is fantastic! But go there late in the evening or very early in the morning - else there will be to many tourists.Expect to use minimum 2 hours there, even though you do not think a mini-world is anything for you, this place is a must see."
2,"I had such high hopes for Cafe Mexico but alas it was a bit of a let down. The service is ok, very nice, even though our server was slow with the drinks and spilled a whole plate of creamy enchiladas all over our coats. That was something I'll never forget, I don't think my coat will either. The menu seemed to have a lot of choices but in actuality it did not. It just a lot of repetition and white space. Mexican food is one of my favorites so I knew what to expect and I was not expecting what was put down in front of me. Once I got my food, it was extremely cold, as if they had the kitchen in another building and walked it over in the dead of winter. Even though they told me mine would take a few minutes longer because it had to cook longer it was actually one of the first dishes to come out. I might give this place another chance but I am not rushing back there anytime soon. I will just have to hang my sombrero and wait until I come across a real, authentic Mexican experience."
3,"Südhang has a really great, warm friendly atmosphere. I was there on a Monday evening after a day of mooching around Hamburg and wanted a nice glass of wine to finish the day. I got to test first which is great. The staff were all really friendly and welcoming. Would defiantly go again. I think it's a great first date location, nice lighting, mellow and calm atmosphere."
3,"Sehr gutes Sushi, viele Sushi-Variationen, sehr nette Bedienung, frische Zutaten! Preislich etwas gehoben, kein Vergleich zu all-you-can-eat Anbietern."
2,"Have to agree with previous review, trendy enough but I was irritated by the micro-portions. A few grams of food are not going to be enough to fill you. In fairness, what food there was did taste good."
0,"Sorry to have to give this restaurant one star.  Ate there for lunch twice, one week apart, in July 2017.  First lunch visit I ordered the vegetarian lunch menu.  The taste of the food was fine but an hour later I was running to the toilet.  i thought, things happen, something I ate didn't agree with me.I went back exactly a week later and this time I ordered the Chicken lunch menu.  Same thing happened.I will not be going back.  Sorry."
2,"Very touristic place, cocktails are rather sweet, then alcoholic. View on Harbor is good, but qui lift of service is average"
3,A bit over priced I thought but I think that is because of the location. They are right off of the water and across the street from the Westin and the Orchestra House. Outdoor and indoor seating. There are also two parts of this place. One is the brassiere and one was the bistro. I went to the brassiere part. French cuisine and the menu was a little limited. There was steak and pasta basically. I didn't want full meal so I went with the appetizer of Beef Tartar. Nice presentation and it was pretty good. Good for the one visit but not sure if I would be back.
4,"I can't believe I've missed this little gem for so long! Meine kleinraumdisko is a deceptively tardis-like bar/club just opposite the REAL supermarket by Feldstrasse U-bahn. Low key beats being mixed at conversational volume, cool sofas in a number of corners, trippy visuals on projected on the walls, and Augustina beer for 3 euros (which doesn't give you an Astra-style hangover of death) make it a compelling destination! I'll definitely be spending a lot more time here."
2,"This Schanzenviertel brick icon is popular amongst everyone for their Hamburgers, meaning the food and also the local people, the spacious outdoor bench seating up on the hill next to the U3 and S Bahn stop, and the thick pommes (french fries)  that you dip in this flaky sea salt for flavor!  Mainly a lunch spot for me, but for dinner, it gets romantic, as there are soft candles glowing everywhere and a basic, but classy menu offering fish, meats, and pastas.  I had a wrapped baked fish once with steamed veggies and herbs that was not only healthy but had a nice wholesome flavor to it.  Portions are plentiful and prices are fair.The staff speaks limited English, because it really is more a local spot, but the chef here is famous and for such a reputation, the food is delicious and affordable. Now they have this outdoor grilling area for Kalbbratwurst or normal bratwurst and also for those tasty french fries we all love.  They make a relish mayo sauce or something with herb that gives it a slight yellow/green tone, but it tastes awesome with the fries and get some salt flakes also. It is some special sea salt that looks like light snow flakes, you can not order fries here without that!!!"
3,"Really authentical. We wanted to have some good Indian food and we got it here! The food is great and people are nice. The place is not fancy but clean. If it is full you have to bring a little patience with you. The only negative point could be that at the end of the night you do not have so much choice, if the dish is over they do not do it anymore. At least you are sure that they prepare it fresh!"
4,"I am a long time customer of Panthera Rodizio in Hamburg, I usually go every time I am in Germany.The food is fantastic! When ordering, simply ask for Rodizio and skip the Salad bar  you don't have to have the salad unless you want it.I admit the service is slow at times, but having 20 or so staff serving a 300 cover restaurant thats packed and new customers arriving as soon as the ones that have finished, I feel the service is good.The atmosphere is very alive and noisey, which is to be expected. As someone else said, Alsterwasser is like a Shandy, beer watered down with lemonade. There are 2 P.R. in Hamburg. The one in H.H. (Hamburg Harburg) is a bit smaller and the service there is terrible, the main P.R. is near the docks in Hamburg (Hamburg Harfen). They also have one in Bremen, but I don't like this one so much, it's in the railway station (bahnhof)."
4,"This was the first time I had set foot on a previously operational submarine. The sub is parked up in an old industrial area on The Elbe, which is just the right setting to get you in the mood, nothing too glitzy for the old Russian sub. Inside the sub itself is really interesting, old Russian components, pipes everywhere and you get to 'see' what conditions on the sub would have been like. Plus during your journey through the sub you get to climb and crawl through the narrow doors of the sub.Then after the tour you can sit down with a nice mulled wine whilst thinking what it would be like serving on an active sub. I'd hate it, I'm far too tall, would have back problems after the first couple of days.... After the tour I had the urge to load up Red Alert 2 and take down some dolphins with my fleet of Russian subs..."
0,The WORSE customer service I ever faced in my life .. I went with my family asked the hostess about a table ...: she said 45 mins max and she took our number ... went back to her after 45 mins .. she said sorry no tables for u today...  and that she told us waiting time is 2 hrs ... she was treating us extremely bad .. is it because we r from the gulf ? My kids were starving and waiting .. for nothing ...
4,"Wonderful new little cafe serving home cooked food and thoughtfully sourced coffee and teas. The owners are kind and passionate about the quality of the ingredients they use, which hasn't gone unnoticed by locals as they regularly sell out of what they have on offer. There are also items from their family farm for sale and free wifi :)"
3,I love Campus Suite franchise. after the Balzac this is my favorite place to hangout in the morning. Campus have really low prices and quite good snacks which are even better than Balzac's. Lots of stuff for Bio & Eco lovers.
4,"Friendly, Cosy, Delicious.This place is our second home. The staff is super positive, quick and always welcoming. You have got a million choicesfrom breakfast, potatoes over chicken in peanut sauce, wraps. pancakes to Giros. There is always something you are longing for. The fresh joices and cocktails take you to the lost summer AND the place even has SOYA milk for all us lactose intollerant people. Oh and the Martini comes in a martini glass.AND comes at a very good price. I bet James B. would come here if he ever had another case in HamburgMy only suggestion would be to come up with a weekly special, which is not on the menu and could surprise regulars like us!And of course as always the toilette review: they are clean, but a touch of comfort could be added. Some vintage style accessoires or something.I gotta say, it is my favorite place in the Schanze  don't know what we would do without it."
3,"I got some takeaway grilled meats here with my Cypriot flat mate on a lazy Saturday evening. What can I say: it was delicious! The service was friendly, and the portions plenty. The meat was perfectly grilled (not dry at all), and the tzatiki fresh. Only downside: the chips were not great (but then again--my Belgian nationality requires me to be this picky when it comes to those golden sticks of deliciousness). I had to take my Greek-speaking companion's word on the authenticity, but it definitely tasted that way. Great place for a cheap pig-out meal, but if you want more refined Greek food, there are other places."
4,"A long line in front of this place hinted that the reviews were legit. Each scoop was 1.40 EUR, a bit more expensive than usual, but you get a taster of another flavour for free, on top. Onto the ice cream itself: one taste of it and we were hooked: the coconut sorbet is quite simply the best coconut ice cream we've ever tasted. It kind of reminded us of Booja-Booja's Coconut Hullabaloo, until now our favourite - only that Luicella's was ten times better. Pistachio was also very good. Highly recommended!"
4,"My favorite falafel place ever!!! I used to live in Hamburg and bike here often. My favorite was the falafel Teller box. So many delicious things on one plate. They make them in house and hot and fresh in front of you. I also like their mint tea. And they were always friendly even though I didn't speak German well. I live back in San Francisco now, but my boyfriend and his band are in Hamburg today to play a concert and I told him to go here! He has heard me talk about it a bunch!Totally worth the visit and it's in a great neighborhood w tons of rad shops near by."
3,Brüdigams combines  an interesting and relaxing atmosphere with quality food. Our waiter was really helpful and we ended up enjoying delicious wild boar with a delightful Bulgarian red wine. All and all the experience was great and good value for money. Would visit again.
3,Fast and delicious!  Tried the wagyu cheeseburger loved how light it was . I would qlso recommended their mochi !
4,"The best Mongolian barbeque I've been to. Lots of choice of oriental starters, buffet main courses and the grill too. Also a great selection of desert dishes and ice cream. Very reasonably priced too.Friendly staff and a nice modern interior."
3,"Ate dinner at Xeom based on the Yelp reviews. We showed up to a packed house and had about a 10 minute wait before being seated. We shared a table with two other diners in a corner of the restaurant. (Thankfully I'd read that sharing tables is common...)I ordered pho while my husband had curry chicken, and we shared spring rolls. The spring roll wrapper was a lot thicker than I am used to - I wonder if they're not available in Hamburg. The curry chicken was ok, but it had a strange smooth consistency like gravy, with big chunks of carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes. I was surprised to see tomatoes in the curry, but we ate them anyway. The pho was OK, definitely smaller portions than in the U.S., and less cuts of meat. I was given a lemon wedge whereas I'm used to receiving a lime wedge. There was also no mint leaves, beansprouts, or are jalapeño peppers... The table offered a bottle of sriracha, but no hoisin sauce. I was still hungry after dinner.Overall dinner was OK, but just not what I'm used to from the plethora of Vietnamese restaurants at home. Xeom is cash only."
1,"I'm a regular at this location, and today noticed a significant drop in the quality of the ingredients in my JB Caesar Burger. Think less Gourmet Burger, and now closer to McDonald's burger on a plate.Please disregard older reviews of this restaurant, as they are for a different higher quality menu."
4,"What a lovely restaurant. The server/owner was delightful, warm, charming, witty, and welcoming. Phenomenal service. Fantastic chef/owner. Food was outstanding. Perfectly executed. Delicious. Would return in a heartbeat and with great pleasure. Highly recommended!"
2,"Went here in January, on a saturday. place was more packed than a can of sardines! couldn't even reach the bar, getting to the restroom was almost out of the question, and actually, now that i remember, even getting into the bar itself was a pain. people standing in the doorway smoking. lol. I'm sure its nice when its not that busy, but if you happen to go when it is too busy, just run across the street to haus 73 and get cozy there."
4,There are several of these along the S and U-Banh stations near Jungfernstieg but they are all of consistently high quality. You can't beat the value of these - particularly the jumbo curry combo. You get a whole meal for ~$4-5 USD at the current exchange rate - incredible by any measure in Europe. Service is ridiculously quick but is cash only - a problem for those of you getting by using a travel card. This place served as lunch and dinner one day when I was particularly desperate - I didn't regret it one bit.
3,"Fabulous restaurant. Went here for dinner with my husband and we were completely impressed by the service and food. I was very afraid given that we are American and didn't know if we would be treated well at an upscale German restaurant but they were very hospitable. The regular stares and gawks per usual but nonetheless good service. Note: You HAVE to make a reservation. They do not close at 12, they close well before then so you need to be prompt and also have a reservation."
4,"Since I'm an Asian, I dare to say this Japances Restaurant is very very traditional and their cooking is fantastic. Even they have Teppanyaki, there is not much in Hamburg. I'm sure I will try it next time."
4,"Good place on a side street with open-air sitting available. Very nice, fast and welcomming service."
4,"We sat outside on the hilltop patio with gorgeous views of the water. They planted a line of trees along the edge, and they form a canopy of leaves above interwoven with a bamboo lattice (wonderful design). We ordered the raspberry lemonade (tasty), lamb and roast (everything was delicious and melted in our mouths). Wish we had time for dessert. Wonderful spot to enjoy lunch."
2,Very big and quite impressive but once you've seen one section you've pretty much seen it all.
0,Good food but the waiter charged me 3 euro for a glass of water.... not happy at all.
2,"This place has 4.5 stars with the most reviews(over 1500) compared to all other vietnamese restaurants in the area based on google. So coming here from orange county I am on a hunt for good vietnamese food to prepare for the future homesickness. First impression: spacious seating area. Self seated. Line moves decently quick. Ordering food with Vietnamese worked for me since I don't speak German and lady waitress doesn't seem to know English. She came about 2 minutes after I found myself a seat. Very attentive. I got a pho bò since....what else is there to eat on a gloomy day at a vietnamese place. To be honest I was disappointed because I didn't taste beef broth I was expecting. More seasoned boiled water than broth. Noodles were not boiled soft enough for my taste but I understand that some people do prefer that over soft fresh noodles. Pho didn't come with fresh herbs on the side like usual so I was bummed out as well. I love bean sprouts in my pho. Overall, this is a place to go to if you work around the area and need a quick lunch. I don't hate it but didn't love it either. Maybe there are other items on the menu that could be a hit."
3,"Great food, drink and cocktails too. great location. a definite improvement on the rather snooty Ratsweinkeller that used to be there."
4,"I've been here multiple times over a few years, and never fail to be impressed.  Most recently for lunch, the efficiency, quality, and charm - - at an incredible price - - is something just jaw-dropping.  Nice thin crust, ingredients with abandon and flair,  remarkable service, fun vibe - - Luigi's continues to blow me away.  The experience can vary depending on whether you get there when it is packed (which it generally is) or you can breeze in and get a table (worth timing your visit to make this a possibility).   But no matter what, and no matter when, you will have some super tasty pizza, and a vivid experience."
4,"Not only the best Chinese food in Hamburg, but the best ethnic restaurant thus far in the city!  Being Chinese and from California, I'm very picky in regards to ethnic cuisine - especially anything Asian.  I've now tried a handful of Asian places in Hamburg and have been sorely disappointed each and every time.  Either it's been Germanic interpretations of Asian food, or Asian simply not done right.  With that kept in mind, Mei Moon was an incredibly nice surprise!  The restaurant has a very extensive menu, but mixed in are quite authentic dishes.  The dim sum items were great - very fresh, made to order, served piping hot, and seasoned just right.  Service was very good - the wait staff spoke perfect German, English, and Chinese.  The atmosphere was like any Chinese restaurant stereotyped, but very clean nonetheless.  This will be my go-to place from now on whenever that craving for good Chinese hits."
0,"Heard great things about this restaurant from a friend who travels to Hamburg frequently, and the fact that they closed at 11 was even better! The night before we had called to confirm what time their kitchen closed and we were told 10:30. However, when we arrived the next day at 9:10, we were told that they weren't seating + serving anymore and we were forced to find another dining option last min on our last night in Hamburg."
2,"Very average indian food. Veg thali was better than other dishes. But, i guess that's okay with that price. Also, you can buy fresh sweets and bhujiyas which are really good. I also bought panner (cottage cheese) for my home and it was really good!"
2,"There's nothing wrong with Chakra, in my opinion. The interior is comfortable enough, with a mix of couches and chairs; the staff is friendly and moderately attentive, and the prices are, well, fine. It's just the mediocre nature of the place--just another bar/cafe/restaurant in the Schanze. We both had vegetable tacos and a beer, and in keeping with the general feel, were neither disappointed nor particularly impressed. How very--ho hum."
4,"Just wow! Extremely friendly and helpful staff, impressive food! Anytime! 100% recommendation!"
3,"Azeitona's charm comes from its rundown but cozy establishment. Great place to eat really cheap and really good food. I had the mezze for 2 and It was wonderful. My personal favorite: their hummus! The place is perfect to hang out with friends, but it's not that big...so don't plan your next birthday party over there. On the downside, staff might have been very friendly but they were rather inattentive. Also, I had a pomegranate lassi which was not nice at all. It was small and way too sweet (taste was rather artificial). If you want to drink something opt for tea. Other than that, I can't wait to try another dish. Mucho love, D."
3,"We'd ridden the trains all day, toured Hamburg, and were hungry! The Nagel bierstube has great beer (Nagelbrau is a nice dark beer) and good traditional fare. The schnitzel is satisfying and the prices are reasonable. You could do a lot worse and walk a lot further. I was very happy, and so was my partner. Also, they have a full bar!"
3,Went here for a business dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I had read many of the good reviews on here and wasn't expecting much. Thankfully I walked out happy. It's a really nice room and a good place for business or private meals. Service was polite and very professional. The menu is higher-end than most places on or near the Lange Reihe. We were quite happy with both our appetisers and main courses and had a great bottle of wine to go with it.....a recombination from the waiter. I'll definitely be back here when entertaining out of town business guests. I also would come with my wife for a romantic dinner. A really solid place which has established itself over the years and is well frequented. I highly recommend reserving a table if you do come.
3,This Jim Block restaurant is located close to Gänsemarkt. It is nicely decorated and clean. The staff was very nice and the food was good. It is a great fast food alternative.The entrance is even with the ground.
2,"Its is a small Thai/asia restaurant in my hometown back in hamburg, Germany.I was here before long before i used type/yelp. It is constantly ok'ish.It is not outstanding food but it is also not bad.This time i had fried wantan and i was really disappointed, a specialty in Germany is that the fried wantan are filled (that different to the us when i ask even my favourite Chinese spot, they never are able to make filled wantan, it don't really get why, cause in the WanTan soup they always use filled ones) - but back to my experience with Hee Yang, i was disappointed cause the wantan have been filled but with just a very, very small amount of meat. As main course i had chicken sweet and sour. It was a small portion (I was here for Dinner). The sauce was ok not outstanding and chicken just some pieces. On the positive side it was made with fresh ingredients like gherkins, carrots and pineapple. But as said not a lot, even the rice was a small portion. i was still hungry so that i had to order another starter so i had the satay chicken kebabs. The peanut sauce and the skewers have been very good. and i was happy that i ended with the kebabs. Overall ok, but for the small portion and mediocre wantan i have to reduce 2 stars. Just another point on the positiv side: everything (except the fisch sauce) is without MSGs. Immer wenn ich nach Hamburg zu Besuch komme in meine Heimatstadt ist ein Besuch in der Langen Reihe Pflicht. Ich war schon ein paar mal mittags bei HeeYang, diesmal war es 22:30 und ich war noch hungrig. So endete ich bei Yang. Ich bestellte mir WanTan, das besondere in Deutschland gegenüber der USA wo ich jetzt lebe ist das man hier die WanTan füllt mit Schweinehack, oder manchmal auch mit Scampis. Das wurde auch hier gemacht, aber so dünn und wenig das ich es erst gar nicht gesehen habe, geschweige denn geschmeckt :(.Nun weiter zum Hauptgang was ein knusprigen Huhn süß sauer war. Auch hier wiederholte sich eine übersichtliche Portion. Ich möchte beinahe sagen ich hatte gefühlte 10kleine Stücke Hühnchen. Die Soße war ok, mir gefiel das man merken konnte es wurde mit frischen Zutaten wie Gurken, Karotten und Ananas gearbeitet. Aber selbst diese Zutaten waren spärlich auf dem Teller verteilt. Die Soße selber war wirklich ok für meinen Geschmack, da hatte ich wesentlich bessere (aber auch wesentlich schlechtere). Nun sei es drum, ich war noch hungrig und habe dann die Satay Spiesse bestellt. Die waren dann 100% lecker und ich war froh das dies mein Abschluss war denn bei der Soße hätte ich am liebsten den Teller abgeleckt. Das Hähnchenfleisch war super zart und saftig perfekt gegart und eben einfach lecker. Die Spiesse waren mit Hähnchen und abwechselnd immer ein Stück Frühlingszwiebel gesteckt. Wenn ich wieder hingehe werde ich sicherlich drei oder viermal die Spiesse bestellten und woanders meinen Hauptgang holen. Die waren es wirklich wert. Dennoch am Ende des Tages muss ich sagen zwei Sterne gehen an den Geiz auf dem Teller verloren."
3,"Great place. However cooks do not know the difference between medium rare and medium. Tried to order medium rare like 5 times in  different Otto places, they always brought me medium/well done. Overall food it great, brioche bun is yum, truffle Mayo - thumbs up, stuff is nice too. And yes, they have great selection of craft beers!"
3,"The best burger I have ever had in the Europe thus far. As an American, I'm pretty picky on my burgers - I love them, and I've only been scarred by my experiments in Europe with burgers. When visiting...Hamburg, my friend and I thought it'd be fitting to have...a hamburger, in Hamburg. An acquaintance recommended this place, and they were right - it was great. The atmosphere is like a hip Mexican hipster cantina, despite no Mexican food. There are old punk records over the bar and really friendly bartenders. We didn't have a reservation, so we had to sit at the bar, which was fine. We each had beers and I had a burger (something Texan) with an egg on it (I love eggs on anything) and my friend had a cheeseburger. The burgers themselves are HUGE, and were perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. They fell apart and were very juicy. The weirdest thing is that the burgers come on *English muffins*. I had experienced that before with a good burger in Seattle at brunch recently, but..it was a bit odd. I think the burger would have held together a bit better with a sturdier bun, but, it makes the place unique. I'll surely revisit this place when craving a burger in Hamburg again. Delicious!!"
1,"A real dissapointment!We had the 400 gr Western Steak today. Inspite of the fact that I had asked the waiter, and he had asked the cook, to make me a steak brown and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, what I got was a rubbery piece of meat, that was cooked a low heat, had no brown crust on the outside, nor was it juicy on the inside, and just not good at all. No way they will get me back here. Friendly service does not help when the food is lousy! What a shame"
4,"Really cool modern experience. At first I thought all the tech was gimmicky, but I have to say the quality of the food was top notch! Really enjoyed my experience."
2,"I was taken by a friend here. Had heard of it before but never actually thought of going. I was quite excited to find another steak place as I love good meat. Anyway, came here to first be greeted by the horrible smell at the entrance of the buidling. OK, it's a meat market so I can understand the smell but it's just not the first impression you want when walking into a restaurant. Once upstairs, the decor is a bit bland and old fashioned. The night we were there it was also packed with senior citizens. We were by far the youngest there (outside of staff) and we're in our mid-thirties. Nevertheless, the steak was OK. I wouldn't say it was anything more than average though. I found the meat a bit tough as well. Service was quite good on the night we were there but in summary, decent meat and good service is the opposite of what I expected. Actually had the meat been better, I would of cared far less about everything else."
4,"Perfekt! Essen, Preis-Leistung, Ambiente  eine echte Bereicherung für Hoheluft."
4,"If you want to drink a glass of wine with a wonderful panoramic view, don't hesitate to go up to this bar restaurant. You will have access to the rooftop where you can chill on the comfortable benches or armchairs. The waiters are kind and they know their products so they can advise you for your order. The only thing is that it's a bit expensive but you will forget the price once you taste their tasty wines."
3,"Wow.....what an experiance.Crazy place, excellent service (lot of passion) and great food.Reservation recommendet. It was full the whole evening.High noise level.Pizza is the main dish and 90% of all orders.Excellent. However by far not the best in town.Burrata was delicious. Perfect!Clear a place to be if you are close to the harbour."
3,"Yummy burgers, good fries, nice staff OK prices. I like it here :)"
4,"These cupcakes are absolutely fantastic. Even though I had them growing up as a child, they never tasted like these. The cake itself is very moist and the topping (icing/frosting) extremely smooth and creamy. I can really recommend them. EUR2,50 each is a bit much, but seeing that they're hand made and absolutely delicious - well, life is short and as they say, we're not here for a long time, but for a good time.Thanks for making my day, Happy Kappy. I'll be back..!"
2,"I have now learned that the sub sandwiches that I attributed to being 'faux-croque' in my initial review are the norm for croques in Germany. That said the name of the place is still misleading; if the croques in Germany are typically sub sandwiches, I'd expect a place could Croque Francais  to serve the french style croques. Maybe that's just me.The rest of initial review still holds as it was based on the sandwich that I ate."
3,"I give Xeom a solid four stars. It would be five, except that I really like Vietnamese noodle bowls (Bun), and theirs is pretty mediocre. The noodles are extremely thin and flimsy, and clump together in the bowl. If you like soup (Pho), though, then you're in good shape. Theirs is delicious (I had the chicken soup). There isn't much spice in the food, but there is a bottle of Sriracha on the table if you need a kick.The menu is pretty standard Vietnamese, with the aforementioned noodle bowls and soups, along with some salads and other specialty dishes. They have a large selection of drinks; I had the lemonade last time I was there, which was nicely presented and delicious.The dining room is small and cramped, and they're frequently packed for mealtime. We arrived around 12:30 for lunch and didn't have trouble getting a seat, but it gets packed around 1 PM. The chairs are all stools, and there are no coat racks, so you kind of have to make do if you have a coat with you.The staff is nice, and seems to all speak English, in case you need an assist. The prices are very fair. Overall, one of the better dining options in the city, just wish their Bun was tastier."
4,Their cappuccinos are great. TheIr espresso is medium to dark roast which suits my personal preference. No big bubbles on the foam and the milk was heated to the right temperature. The decoration is great and overall the place has a really nice vibe to it.
3,"When I thought we wouldn't find good pizza in Hamburg, my hubby found this spot! The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven which you can see from the dining room. The pies are huge! We had trouble finishing the two that we ordered and had to bring them home to have for lunch the next day.I ordered the ham with mushrooms while my hubby ordered the pizza parma. Both were very yummy. The pizza dough was nice and thin and had that bit of chewiness. The toppings were good, though I think they are a bit heavy-handed on the cheese. This place has a great lunch deal, which I probably could not partake in because it would be a trek from where I work, but the regular menu will do just fine."
3,"This is the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Hamburg last week. What a great way to kick off a stint in a new city - with a go-to Ramen spot!My husband and I arrived around 6:40pm on a Wednesday night. It was very busy and we ended up waiting for over an hour for a table for the two of us. After a few minutes of figuring out how the line worked, we added our name to the list.We tried to order gyoza, but they were out. We ordered the fried chicken instead and OMG. It was so juicy and delicious. My only complaint is that we couldn't eat it all, otherwise we wouldn't be hungry for our ramen. For the main course, I ordered the Shio with Egg and Seaweed and my husband ordered the Miso ramen with corn and butter. We were both pleased with the ramen.I can't wait to go again to try out the other types of ramen that they have available!"
3,A very interesting mock up of different location. we went there my friends kids 6-8 and they had a blast.
2,"Sorry fellas, but it's NOT like being on the real beach: so damn packed you can't even strech your legs and the view is non-existent due to the monstrous Blohm&Voss shipyard with all the noise from welding and construction (is it another yacht of Abramovich?) Well, actually it's not that bad, better than infierno of the cement and glass in the city on a hot summer day. They have cocktails, they have beer, they have sand - but that's about it."
2,"Started out with the pork+prawn spring rolls, very tasty, although oily. Tried the beef and chicken pho. The broth was ok, but had to add some Sriracha for a bit more flavor. The lemonades (traditional and raspberry) were nice presented and refreshing! Small space inside with tables close to each other, a wall covered with pictures from Vietnam and music playing in the background. The staff was very friendly, the food came quick, even though it was crowded. Wouldn't come back for the pho, but would definitely try more items from the menu."
1,"Clouds is a beautiful place to have dinner or drinks and I have been there several times. The food and cocktails are always delicious and I would say that they are worth the high price. As a grand finale to my mother's visit from abroad (and first time in Hamburg) I took her to Clouds the night before she flew the 27 hours home. Unfortunately this time I was utterly disappointed and have a particularly bad taste left in my mouth as a result of the service and tipping rationale. Our 'personal' waitress was abrupt and argumentative from the beginning when we simply asked if there were any tables by the window free. She then presented herself as our sommelier saying she could absolutely recommend the perfect wine to match our dishes and went on to dismiss the whole wine list and suggest merely the most expensive red and white wines on the menu. As a wine scientist I found this incredible considering the wine list has many options, and plenty that would have been a far better match. When attempting to discuss the wines with her she was dismissive and simply told me I was wrong by saying that Spätburgunder is the same variety of grape as Pinot Noir. I strongly recommend that your waitresses are trained in wine service (at least) before they claim to be sommeliers.Despite feeling hustled throughout our dinner we enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the restaurant. When it came to the bill I found the cost of the meal and a section below to rate our experience. Having not ticked a rating the waitress pushed me define if I was satisfied, happy or ecstatic with the experience. I was more than happy to give them a rating but found it staggering that the rating was accompanied by a percentage tip (already calculated from the total cost of the bill). Although I thoroughly believe in tipping when it is deserved and intended to tip for this meal too, being forced to tip is uncouth and a significant faux pas on the behalf of the restaurant management (who incidentally, were on holidays and not available to speak to on the night we were dining). My advice - train your staff in wine, don't force the tipping with satisfaction ratings on the bill."
4,"Miniatur Wunderland markets itself as the world's largest model train exhibit, but it's a lot more than that. This place is incredible; all of the hype is absolutely justified.I don't want to spoil the experience for you (exactly the same words my coworker told me when she recommended Miniatur Wunderland, which I now completely understand), so I'll just give you a few tips for ensuring a great experience:1. You can and should make a reservation online before you visit. It's a little weird because you don't actually need to pay for this reservation; it's just some kind of ticketing system to control flow.2. If you're visiting on a weekend or a holiday, plan to go as early as possible, like between 8:30-9:30am. The place starts filling up with visitors around 10am and the experience is way better when it's empty and you have the place to yourself.3. The entrance is on the 2nd floor and there are lockers available for stowing your backpacks (1euro deposit). Take the elevator to the 3rd or 4th floors where the exhibits are. I was really concerned about ""where to start"" but in the end it really doesn't matter. You'll be impressed no matter what order you see everything in.4. There are buttons on the railing throughout the exhibits, which activate various details in the scene. Press ALL the buttons! (But really, some of them are quite delightful and you don't want to miss out.)5. Plan to stay for 2-3 hours...at least!If you find yourself in Hamburg you need to visit, for the child inside you. Miniatur Wunderland will bring out the wonder and excitement of the child you used to be."
4,"The most Irish Irish pub that I've been to in Hamburg. They pride themselves on the quality of their Guinness, the breadth of their whiskey collection and the standard of their food. I told them I found them on the internet as the top Irish pub in Hamburg, they countered with we're the top Irish pub in Germany! and pointed to a wall of awards. When we approached the bar we were offered two Guinness, almost as if that was the only option. I asked about the other beer available and then decided that it was either Kilkenny or Guinness. I went for Guinness. Next up, choosing some food. Near the front of the menu was Fish and Chips. I love a good fish and chips, but I've not had any since coming to live in Germany (1 year ago). I asked how it was, more meaning what type of fish and chips it was (chippy or restaurant), and was told that it's very good. I was then told that they were so confident in it that If you don't like it, you can have it for free. The Guinness was good. The fish was beautiful. As with all Irish pubs, the prices aren't cheap. A 400ml Guinness is EUR3.70 and the Fish and Chips was EUR10. I'll be back."
4,"A delightful, local restaurant for authentic German food. Both the schnitzel and the sausages were remarkable. Right on the water, the outdoor seating was delightful. Service was great. Highly recommended."
3,"Beautiful building and scenery, really good to discover different types of tea. Only slight problem is that it takes a bit of time to get the bill. Would def go again!"
3,"Good and cheap restaurant  in Altona, near the beach. They serve sausages with bread and potatoes salad, and other traditional German fast-food. We were sitting at a table which was just in the way between the stairs and the beach, so there was a lot of passing."
3,Best ice cream/gelato I've had yet in Hamburg. Very creamy and smooth. I had one scoop of After Eight and one of hazelnut. I wish the After Eight was mintier but both tasted like mint and hazelnuts. The chocolate and nut cone left something to be desired - it was stale. I'd say stick with a cup and you should have a 5 star experience!
4,"Qype City night January '08 brought me here. They had prepared a great set menu for us. Nine dishes, they said, but I'm pretty certain it was more like 12. We had cold dishes to start, glass noodles, cold meats, tofu & garlic, etc. That wasn't really my thing, but each successive course brought better and better food. One course brought some really great prawns. They were messy to eat, but delicious. After the two (or three, I forget) main courses came some amazing soup, and after that we got one small sweet dish. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it seemed like dates covered in dough, rolled in sesame seeds. The best chinese food I've had in Hamburg (Ok, I've not really had much chinese food, but still :)"
4,I lovely little restaurant with fabulous staff. All the food courses were tasty and special. I would definitely recommend for dinner.
2,i tasted the pho ga and the bun bo. what can i say... it was decent food but nothing that really excited me.
0,"Five years ago i first knew this restaurant and immediately fell in love with it.however, I have to admit that as time goes by, the quality of the food there is really decreasing, especially after they moved to this new place!I believe my vist last weekend is gonna be my last stay there - well, if the portion is getting smaller i can still understand, but i am really angry when served with STINK sea snails!! schade!"
4,"Leaning house of awesomeness! This is one of those hidden-away pearls of Hamburg. Sadly, now that Hafen City has been planted, this may become a bit less hidden in the near future. The food, in a word, is KILLER. Try the Hamburg Hamburger... sample the potato salad, or venture into the unknown with the Hamburg Weißwürstchen, either way you will not be leaving hungry or poor. The service is friendly, but very Hamburg... so if you are an ass, they will treat you accordingly. The location is small and very much heeled over like a ship at sea, frozen at a 15º -- while some people find this to be charming... others, as I recently learned, simply can not eat in such an environment. The music is pure Bert Kaempfert classics from 1950 - 1970. If you don't know who Bert Kaempfert is, shame on you! Now go Google him. In summary, if you are in this area and are looking for a place to eat. This is the place. If you want to grab a bite before heading off to the Elbphilharmonie... well, you have time... but this is a good place to spend it."
2,"Great burrito, best I've had in germany. Not too authentic (I'm mexican and live in cali so i'm a lil picky) but still delicious. Took a while to get the food, but our burrito was hot till the last bite and delicious. The steak chunks are a bit big and i wasn't too keen on having to use a knife and fork for a burrito. Cool staff, super friendly, and overall a great burrito."
3,"I went there for lunch. The food tastes good and the service is lightning fast. The saladbar was fresh, but they could have given us a broader sortiment to chose from.Overall: Good place for a quick meal."
3,"Vegetarian, but surprisingly not bad! The Eggs Benedict was great with potatoes and fruit cup. The entire staff was all female which was really cool. They were working very, very hard. Service was kind of slow, but that may be a German thing. Not much seating. I had ice water, which they didn't try to sell me a pricey bottle...nice. Freshly squeezed OJ and hand-spun shakes. This is a local favorite restaurant. The neighborhood is kind of suspect, but definitely OK during the day when w went. This was truly home cooking. I would go here again, bring a guest and recommend to a friend (but prepare them all with a description of the place)"
3,"The restaurant is decorated in a modern eco-friendly way. Creative menu and chill service. Even though not shown on the menu directly, you can request your pizza to be made with gluten-free ingredients. And it tastes great (which is absolutely hard to achieve for gluten-free pizza)! They nailed it!"
3,"Enjoyed an excellent mid week lunch here. Helped by a bright spring day, it felt great to be down by the water in this large, open modern restaurant. The whole feeling was of space and light. We were happy to take the recommended specials - great sushi to start with, followed by a main fish course. I then indulged in ice cream, deep fried! The service was friendly but unobtrusive. Great place for business lunches."
4,"Delicious falafel, great price. What more could you ask for? The falafel kimo has tons of sauce, cheese, lentils, potatoes, vegetables. Falafel in Brot is also great, just more of a focus on the delicious falafel."
4,High ball drinks bring back the good old times!!
0,"Awful service. Everything is so slowly. The waiter make an observation, that I asked him to take an order."
4,"I was here on Thursday night with my husband. We were blown away by our meal and immediately made a reservation to come back for Saturday night even though we only had three nights total in hamburg! The first night we had the protein salad and meze plate and the second we had spring lasagne, sweet potato peanut soup and a pumpkin curry dish. Every bite is amazing. This is an absolute must experience restaurant. Some of the best food we have ever had.  As California foodies, that is saying a lot. And all organic and vegetarian! How is it possible? You have to see for yourself. The hosts are warm, welcoming and personal. Don't miss this special special restaurant. We will think of it for many years to come and will make sure to return."
2,"Yep a pretty reasonable place to go eat. Has a prime position on the strip so you sort of expect it to be a littler below par, but it's not, it's pretty good all in all. Not amazing though, but at least you don't end up disappointed, that's the main thing. Service was attentive, and the beer tasted good, and a huge plate of Gyros for only Eur 7,00 was pretty good value, but most other dishes were around the standard 10 Eur mark. A nice touch here is the free Ouzo after the meal.It's definitely a better bet than Taverna Romano across the road."
4,As a UNESCO World Heritage site the warehouse district shouldn't be missed. If you're anything like me and have a thing for bridges in architecture you'll be a happy camper. I love walking around and seen the locks on the bridges and the views down the canals. Read up on some of the history about the warehouse district and how it came to be a UNESCO heritage site. There's some great spots for pictures and just to get a nice walk in.
3,"From the branches of Vapiano I've visited in Hamburg, this is by far my favorite. It's often packed until the kitchen closes at 23:00 during the week (there are not many restaurants in the area so Vapiano is a default choice for many) but it's still rather large and roomy. Service is really friendly and prices are well decent. I love their shrimp penne in lobster sauce and carrots. Recommended!"
2,"5EUR entry costcheesy music... the kind of music you'd only expect to hear in german clubsi mean 80s and 90s music mixed with last year's songs and a bit of bob marley then some ABBA.The DJ thinks that by mixing, he's supposed to mix styles and songs...ok you get my point: Music - BADbut at least its full, its funnythere are a lot of people, which means a lot of weird people too. I am not sure id be back... not really my type of club but if u were rejected entry in the other hip clubs, try it out... you'll have a laugh"
3,"A very good experience in this restaurant. Before I came here, I expected a very hectic all you can eat eatery without any emphasis on ambiance and dining experience. I was wrong and wrong. The restaurant looked really well decorated and it provided a feeling of being in a bar rather than in a restaurant. The ambiance was really cozy, not too loud that people cannot talk to each other, and also not too quiet that people falling asleep. The order mechanism is really unique, as the others have mentioned. As I chose the all you can eat package, I was allowed to choose 5 dishes x 10 rounds (total 50 dishes per person), even though I stopped at round 5. Most of the food were of very high quality, especially the sushi roll and the nigiris, but some others were just so so. They have very good options of drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), and I had weizen+ginger and weizen+lemongrass, which I really recommend. The all you can eat package was a little bit expensive at €25, but I think it was really worth it. My friend and I had a really good time there."
4,"By far one of the best top-class Italian restaurants in Hamburg -- hands down.Recently, I went here with two guests from Dubai who have wined and dined in many of the best restaurants in the world.Gallo Nero's team did not let me down and my guests and I had a fantastically palatable three-course meal with excellent service in an authentically Italian atmosphere in a pleasant surrounding.We all had the pasta with summer truffle for the starter, delicious mains with either turbot, filet from the Fassona Piemontese, or veal, and a lemon-mint sorbet for desert. I am getting hungry writing this review by just remembering how delicious everything was.Yes, Gallo Nero is a bit more on the pricey side, but it is totally worth having very happy guests and such fond memories of an excellent Italian dining experience."
2,This place has a nice laid back atmosphere and solid drinks. The food is good and the staff was nice. A nice place to spend the summer-evening with friends.
4,"A Kebab joint unlike any other I've encountered setting a whole new bench mark as far as kebab shops go Firstly a proper dine in Kebab shop?! Unreal! Being use to ordering my Kebab from a corner stall after a big night out, consuming the contents either on a street bench or as I walk home, this place resembles more of a comfortable Turkish bar/cafe then any kebab shop back in Sydney.The place obviously has quite a following with it's tables still full and lively even on a late Tuesday night. The servings are huge and very tasty!!! Ordering a small plate delivered enough food to comprise three meals for me let alone one! The highlight for me was being able to order a nice cold one with my meal-The fact that I can now enjoy both a Beer and a Kebab simultaneously and at the beginning of a night out rather then as the end of a big one has definitely secured a loyal customer out of me A Kebab shop that serves Beer is just plain genius!! If only they did this in Australia."
4,"Very warm atmosphere. The coffee is great, everything seems homemade and the breakfast is amazing. It's a popular place, so it fills quickly on weekends. Lovely!"
3,"Spacious, and has leash free dog areas - always fun.  Both shady and sunny areas - I take my dog there almost every Sunday."
3,"One of the few good quality places on the Schanze. Not too big with a DJ inside, still it is not a club, but a bar. Cocktails are quite OK as well. It gets pretty crouded so make sure you go a bit earlier or around 10pm. They have a huge screen-bar where when you move your hand the animated fish reacts and starts moving towards your hand. It is quite cool."
3,"I'm not from Hamburg, but it seems to be a cool coffee house, with reasonable prices! Our couchsurfer took us there, and he knows the people running this joint. I took a red tea which was good. The Sunday brunch seems tasty and diverse. Since I am a vegan, I didn't find much to eat there, therefore didn't order it. I would be happy to see some more vegetables and maybe avocado or something that us vegan can eat."
4,"Spell binding and stunning, Hamburg's Art Museum (Kunsthalle) has all the golden greats, plus plenty of modern allsorts.Placed between the lake, the old town and the Station, it's easy to reach and suitably priced and really is a must see during any visit to Hamburg."
4,"Amazing place, details are unbelievable. What amount of work for completing it."
4,"Nice little vietnamese restaurant with good food and even better prices. I've only ever stopped by there for take aways, but the place itself is very nicely decorated and has a nice modern atmosphere. Every time I stopped by there to pick up some food to take home (and it's been quite a few times), the service was really friendly, the food was made very quickly on the spot and it all tasted great when I got home.It seems to be run by pretty young and hip vietnamese people who are super friendly, and the prices are really low for the quality and quantity of food you get. All in all, this place is highly recommended."
2,"pretty good food, decent service.we had a pizza - good, lasagna - not good, a few salads - good, and a pasta special of the day with chanterelle mushrooms - amazing.we were greeted warmly at the door by, seemingly, the owner.we did experience long wait times after that though, but maybe that's just the culture ?"
4,"What a magical world they have created! Halls over halls filled with impressive and amusing details, this railroad model museum took this art form to another level. Even if you haven't heard of it, it is quite an experience. Although I was skeptical at first, the imagination and skills of the two brothers undoubtably deserve our admiration. It was adorable how they took inspiration from actual travels to the different countries and made the landscapes their own. You could spend days here discovering new details...It was great to see they had several opportunities to donate to the respective countries' struggles- a way to give back in a playful setting. We also appreciated the free beverages and perfectly organized waiting room area while waiting 45 minutes to get in. Proud that Germany has such a wonderfully unique museum to offer!"
3,Came here with friends from Malaysia/Singapore who live in Hamburg. This restaurant is in the top of their list when it comes to Chinese food. I enjoyed the dinner.
4,"When the sun is shining, this is the place to be! The associates are fun and relaxed but still focus on service and remain spontaneous.It is a little bit high prices... though sometimes life is to enjoy it!!!"
2,"This place is basically OK if you're up for pizza. I can't complain about the taste and size-wise it's nice and big. I actually managed not to finish mine yesterday which is a rarity for me. I was eating my dinner date's dish along for her though so that's my excuse. I find even at night that place is priced well but everything is very basic. The house wine is not all that good so there goes a star. Further, sitting inside at the front or outside is good but the back room is pretty dreary in my opinion. Finally, while we were there, only one waiter was working and he was busy. Service was very slow although the guy was quite nice. If in the area and up for a pizza, a good place to stop in. I wouldn't hump over here though extra to check this place out. One final positive note: when you pay, you get a shot of either grappa or something sweet. We chose the grappa."
4,The food was amazing. So delicious!  I had the stuffed chicken leg. Fantastic. Husband ordered a simple salad and it was also delicious. Wine was rich and just what I wanted after a week of beer in Bavaria. Highly recommend.
3,"This is one of the numerous beach bars in Hamburg and one of my favourites.Yes, beach bars are a thing in Hamburg. We have the water, but no sand to go with it, so we pile it high by the harbour, throw in some beach chairs and recliners, a collection of chairs and benches, some palm trees and of course outdoor heating!Wooden structures usually serve as large bars and most beach bars, including this one, serve a small selection of food as well. Though the real reason to come here is to stick your feet in the sand and slurp a cocktail or two. Many Hamburgers like to come to these bars after work to chill out a bit in the spring and summer. You can watch the industry harbour from here, which is a nice offset for the kitsch tropical decor of Strand Pauli. It's a brilliant place to grab a nice drink after a long day, though it does get crowded at times. As long as you can grab some comfy seating, just sit back and enjoy!"
2,"Well , just had a falafel here once for 3,50 , not great ,but a great place when ur hungry and your pocket is tight"
4,"Do you like cars? Of course you like cars! You HAVE to see this place! The gorgeous, show-room style exhibition place is fantastic and features cards from a multitude of decades, including video installations, toy/marketing products on show and a porsche simulator! Yes, you get to sit in a Porsche and drive it around the Nueremburgring. How fantastic is that!Definitely a must for every car lover and even those with just a mild interest, it's just so beautiful and well presented.Do not miss the second, temporary exhibit downstairs! It's in a separate space, so it's easy to miss. As it's a changing exhibit, I can't say what they'll be showing off when you get to go, but it's always intersting and really well done. So be sure to check it out."
3,"We had a nice dinner in this Turkish restaurant yesterday night. Everything started kind of meh because we had to go tell Ikea to f****** deliver all the stuff that they should have delivered. But this is a story that I'll tell in a separate review. Once we were out of the blue monster, we were in need of some sustenance. I remembered walking past this large Turkish restaurant which looked promising, so I brought us there. The location is right next to the Altona Bahnhof, so convenient to come with the S1.Even though the restaurant was quite busy, we were seated right away. All the dishes on the menu have pictures, so just point to whatever looks good. For me it was the Döner Teller mit Kalb for € 8,50. There was no beer on the menu (or I couldn't find it), so I picked the closest thing, a big Apfelschorle. It certainly looked like a beer when it arrived with a nice beer head.The food was very tasty. The Döner meat was grilled and tasty and all the sides (yogurt, tomato, cucumber, onion, rice, etc.) were very good as well. There was plenty of food, enough to make me wonder whether I should take some home. But I powered on and finished my whole plate.Service was nice and attentive, I just wished our drinks arrived a little bit faster than they did."
3,"Tasty place if you are looking for Vietnamese street food place. Simple but cozy interior. Friendly service, what else do you expect? Prices are very fair and the dishes are full of flavor."
2,Basically currywurst in a different shape while sat at a table. the deserts were great though.
3,"I wouldn't normally go to a restaurant this close to the Reeperbahn, but a colleague assured me that this place was worth it, and boy was he right! I can't remember the exact name of the dish, but it was pasta with meatballs or perhaps sausage meat and it was amazing. Probably the best pasta I've had in Hamburg. The location is a bit odd (you have to dodge the local prostitutes to get there), but once inside it's nicely decorated and they even have a small outdoor area out the back for those warm summertime evenings. The food is a bit more pricey than most Italian restaurants in Hamburg. A pasta dish will set you back about EUR10 and a meat or fish dish will be more like EUR20. Overall: great food, odd location."
2,"Was there last thursday night and it was absolutely crowded. We managed to get a bar table, which wasn't one of the most comofortable seats since the chairs had no support to lean on. I had ratatouille filled baked potatoe gratinated in cheese and with creme fraiche. It was good, but not a stand out, but I wasn't disappointed. (They have better baked potatoes at other places in hamburg such as Kumpir in Sternschanze and for half the price too). All in all it was a nice evening. We got our food very quickly. Edit: I was there again last friday with 3 friends. I had the vegetarian flammenkuchen. They used mushrooms from a can. I hate when restaurants don't use fresh mushrooms. Again, the restaurant was crowded, but neither food or service was more than average, so I lower it to 3 stars. We went to 15 restaurants and bars in hamburg iover the weekend and this was the worst of them. However it doesn't really say much since the rest of them were excellent."
3,"They sell Augustiner and good, cheap (before 10pm) cocktails. One problem seems to be that it gets a little too packed. We got there as early as 8pm (very early for a Friday night out in Hamburg) and even then we only managed to get half of the last table in the place. By the time we left, two hours later, it was so packed that you literally had to push people out of the way to get anywhere. Like a mosh-pit."
4,This place is so amazing. We got there at 8:45 am and there were no lines and it was not crowded. You will want to spend several hours looking at the incredible detail. Especially the airport!!
2,The Joh. Albrecht Brewery is located at a fleet close to the town hall. If you are lucky or reserve a table you can have a great view of the fleet. The decoration is typical for a German brewery restaurant and the staff was very nice. The food was solid German food. With fair prices considering the size of the dish and the location of the restaurant. The beer (brewed at the restaurant) is very good and there is an offer of different kinds. Enjoy :-)
4,Nice and tasty cakes. They also offer vegan ice-creams which are really good! Cappuccino are nice as well. The place in Sternchanze is really cozy and you will feel comfortable and welcomed.
3,"Okay. I have an unnaturally positive opinion of Kumpir. They make potatoes with different toppings. This isn't rocket science. It is akin to Subway for potatoes.That being said, I love it. I love that it is open late, it is just out of the U/S-bahn station, and it is cheap. Did I mention that it is also tasty and the staff is always friendly? Let me say it now.I have run through most of the menu and it is pretty tasty. It seems like the people working there are generally happy to be alive, which I appreciate.The one thing limiting my review is the quality of some of the ingredients.  I could see an upgrade in quality bringing this to the next level, and a 5 star rating, as long as the price doesn't take an exponential hike.An extra euro here or there would be fine with better quality, but I will keep coming back anyway:)"
4,I'm so sad we didn't take a picture but all the food we ordered were all really good. Friendly staff and delicious food. I will definitely go back next time.
4,"twice I have eaten here and I have to add, the best Falafel I have eaten. The staff is really friendly, which is a plus when the place is full. I totally recommend it!"
4,"What a unique and fascinating experience we had at Miniatur Wunderland! It is simply incredible to see the excitement and enthusiasm in the eyes of the children and their parents, while wondering through the Mini-World. So many little details to see and discover, all kinds of dramas and events have been carefully put into life in America, in Hambourg, at Frankfurt-Airport, in Berlin, in Switzerland, Austria or Italy ...! hours are not enough to really take in all one can contemplate in Miniatur Wunderland! We loved it, and will definitely go there again!"
2,"If nine floors of model ships floats your boat, you'll love this museum. If not, I'd give it a miss."
4,"Hands down the best meal I had in Hamburg.  And the best Spatzle I've ever had!  The restaurant is so charming. It's locally run and serves traditional food from Swabia. There are so many exciting choices to choose from. My friend had a tofu spatzle and I elected for the special of the day which contained spinach, feta, and bacon.  The noodles are SO FRESH.  The service is delightful. All of the ingredients are locally sources and handmade. The portions are huge! I cried a tear knowing that I couldn't bring back the leftovers. The wine is also very good. PLEASE you must go here.  They are excellent!!!"
4,This is definitely my best Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Fresh seafood served right at the table. Much better than some sushi places in the town.
3,"Delicious burritos! Oh my goodness so good!As a Californian it is extremely difficult to find decent (let alone authentic) Mexican food in Germany but this place did it. I mean, who knew you could find nopales in Germany? Extra nice touch with the small religious shrine behind the counter and Mexican wrestler wall paper, it was like stepping into a burrito shop in San Diego.The beans, the rice, the pico de gallo, perfect.Not giving the full 5 stars because it is a small space where people tend to linger long past the end of their meal making finding a seat (or waiting for one) a hassle. Much, much better than Dolores in Berlin. Still, I'd come back here ASAP!"
4,"Really nice Mexican place in the schanze! I was initially worried that I'd not find much to eat on the menu given that spicy food and I don't get along very well, but the staff recommended a few dishes I might like and I wasn't disappointed. I had a really nice mexican sandwich with an omelette and avocado - one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! Recommended for some authentic mexican food for a decent price in the Schanze."
4,"This was such a highlight of our trip to Hamburg. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the ordering concept is cool and easy, and the food is fantastic. The burgers, which they specialize in, are very tasty. I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. Unlike other reviewers I found the cheese to be perfectly melted. Also I ordered my burger medium-well and and it was perfectly cooked. The real winner at Burgerlich, however, is the pulled pork sandwich. My husband had it and i had such food envy. It is by far the best pulled pork sandwich I've tried anywhere in Germany and I would highly recommend it. The burgers are great, but the pulled pork sandwich is even better! The fries are really well done, crispy and perfectly seasoned. As the portions are pretty big it's possible to share fries between a couple. They have other sides like chips and salads as well. The prices are reasonable, especially for the food. Drink costs are a bit steep, but this is typical of most restaurants. The overall atmosphere is more on the hip and cool side. There was a dj playing pop music, which could be loud for some people, but we really enjoyed it. Overall I would highly recommend this place."
4,"What a find -- Xeôm greets you with an interior that wants to put you in the middle of a street stall scene in Vietnam without overdoing it. I really wonder how they got the confused, curled wiring of the lighting past a German electrician! :)They serve a very limited menu, which obviously often helps quality.It certainly does so here - authentic, very tasteful, and reasonably priced too. Don't overlook the homemade drinks, but note that some are somewhat sweet, so ask ahead.Brilliant place that fills up quickly despite its location 'around the corner', for good reason!"
2,"Met with some friends here last week for some HAPPY HOUR cocktails.As far as I recall Happy Hour starts at 10:30pm / 22:30h.The prices for a Jumbo cocktail was about half the normal price which would be around 5-7€ depends on what you order. So normally it's around 12-14€ or something.Well the cocktails are really average. So it's still ok. While I was waiting at the bar, I already had in mind it wouldn't be the worlds best, since the best cocktails are from Brazil... well at least I like to think that way :DI have no idea about the food, but I know they have a very large brunch everyday for 10€ which is really good but you should still go to CAFE MAY if you want cheap and great brunch. So I wouldn't mind to try this place.And the location is really something. They have a large patio and the interior is neat and clean.I would come again for the location and try the food here."
4,"A lot of Asian food in Germany is ""verdeutscht"" as is a significant amount of Asian food Americanized in the States. But coming from NY, you get such a wide array of pretty authentic Asian dishes. Bok avoids becoming like the throngs of fast food noodle joints in Hamburg and offers up some of the best Asian food, I think, you'll get in Hamburg."
3,"On a business trip in town and saw this place.  Walked in on a Tuesday night and seated without a reservation.  We all ordered Ribeye Steaks.  All 3 were cooked to perfection.  One person had the Pepper Sauce and sad is was spicy (says scharf on the menu), and loved it.  Very clean restaurant, and service was great.  Steaks were excellent for the price.  Would definitley come back again."
4,best rolls in town! check kleine-konditorei.com
2,"Essen und Wein super - Service fällt dagegen stark ab. Wen's nicht stört ist hier super aufgehoben, um ehrlich italienisch zu essen."
2,"Not sure what it is about Asian restaurants that they feel it's necessary to have multiple different kinds of stiumulation going on during your meal. I walked in and was bombarded with 1) loud asian music 2) blasting TV with some fishing reality show and 3) loaded newspaper rack.I was tired, and hungry, and it was a block away so I went for it. Under other circumstances probably wouldn't have tried it as the menu doesn't seem anything to write home about. I Had a quick meal of noodles with chicken and veggies, large beer and was out the door. I can say, however, that the noodles were not drowing in MSG which was a nice change from a lot of asian food you find in Germany.The patio DOES seem nice though, and I would go again if that's where I was ending up for the evening."
4,"Authentic Vietnamese food and great service. Would always recommend it and it is worth the drive because it is a bit outside of the city centre but as I said: definitely worth it! Family-runned so you can tell they put their heart in it. Loved the ""Banh Canh"" and the fresh mango shake."
3,"Went here recently as one of my colleagues recommended it. Everything was tasty and seemed fresh. The place was packed at lunch so many other people also seem to think the place is good. It's fairly tight seating-wise but again, if a lot of people are here, things are being prepared fresh and it's a good sign in my eyes. There is an extensive menu and the pricing is definitely fair for the area. There is also seating out front if the weather plays along. I wouldn't call this place a ""destination"" but surely a good choice if in the area."
3,"many pros: good but inexpensive food, casual but stylish setting, busy but friendly waiters I can just sit comfortably at the bar by myself, eat my dinner, observe the kitchen and people around and feel good. cons: parma ham should be served ONLY as a cold cuts, it is so damn salty when grilled in pannini! Can we make it some sort of rule in every cooking book? Thanx!"
4,"Incredible food, great wine selection, service was excellent, and ooo the deserts were to die for. A must try while in Hamburg."
4,Great place. Good prices. Cozy and comfortable. Air is filled with scent of coffee and tasty cakes. Perfect spot for a coffee after a meal at Fish & Co.
4,"One of my all time favorites in the Schanze I must admit. Good music, good people, comfy chairs/banks/sofa's. Closing times are rather flexible so I hear (they close at 4am sometimes if there's people around). The look of the place is retro, but that is a normal occurance in the Schanze. It's not huge but it's big enough. Want to chill out and chat and have a cool bottle of beer? This is worth checking out!"
2,"This is a review for the museum cafe:Free parking. No wifi. Nice atmosphere. Very expensive macchiato which I was charged €2.80 for 200 ml. The average price in Hamburg is €2.30 for 400 ml, so to be charged this amount in one of Hamburg's poorest neighborhoods is out of order. If and only if the cafe's money supports the existence of the museum is this ok. This must be the reason this place is nearly empty at prime time (12:35 pm)."
4,"This is my local Starbucks, practically across the street from my office. Starbucks...you know it. What should I write? If you like it, great. If not, go find something else. There's plenty of better cafes (in regards to taste of coffee) in Hamburg. At the same time, I get my wLAN here and can work well from the location. Plus it's definately one of the nicer Starbucks when it comes to interior. Don't forget to look up when ordering."
3,Such a sweet little cafe with awesome cakes. But the vegan range was quite small unfortunately. The mint and ginger tea was great anyway :) thanks for having us !
3,"Ahoi itself isn't a luxury place, there not much design about this place. It seem more like a coffee to me, but they also offer some food. They also offers really nice view of the Hamburger Hafen, at the same time, can catch up with friends.Because of it this place is quite popular at the weekend, at least when we were there, it was full of people. Luckily we was able to find free spot to sit down. The place is self-service, have to go inside to order. When the pizza is really, the stuff will bring it out and shout the order number, that's how it works here.For me, I really like it here. Having a lovely drink with such a beautiful harbour in the sunny day. It's really enjoyable. If it isn't too windy, I could stay there for the whole day."
1,"Solid drinks, a bit overpriced though. Ambiance is generic / OK, you could smell the toilets inside the bar. It's not living up to its hype. Staff is not very attentive."
4,"Hands down the best falafel in Hamburg. Freshly made, unlike par for the course at most Döner places, who just microwave something that resembles warm wet cardboard. Not only are the falafel fresh, but also perfectly made, crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. All the vegetarian salads and sides like tabbouleh and hummus are also good. If you dine-in- try either the Falafel or Mixed plate (5 Euros), served with a plate full of side dishes. If youre on the run, get the falafel in bread (2.50, ""spezial"" for 3 Euros with your choice of extra like eggplant)."
3,I had a very good dinner but because I arrived alone on Valentine's Day without a reservation I had to sit at the bar which I don't recommend unless you are very tall. It was uncomfortable with legs dangling for so long otherwise dinner of rib eye with shallot potatoes and spinach was excellent and they pour a fair sized glass of wine.
4,"This little place has lovely ""croques"" (sandwiches) and some quite interesting mixtures.Delicious, friendly, sometimes a bit crowded.You can sit outside in the summer."
0,"We were invited to a large dinner party at La Sepia and had high hopes. The folks around the table kept buzzing about how the restaurant is known for it's good fish, and any fish I was bound to order would probably be the best fish I had had in a while. Unfortunately, the fish at La Sepia blows. No, I didn't get a bad dish - the folks next to me, who also ordered the ""Fischplatte"" (an assortment of different types of fish), received the exact same meal. All sat there swooning over their meals as I stared bored over my food, fork in hand, and exclaimed: ""THIS is what you think good fish tastes like?!?"". Don't get me wrong - for many people, the fish at La Sepia will be the best fish they have ever tasted. These people have probably been mainly having fish from the Elbe river. The sauce is pretty good. For the rest of us who are used to Mediterranean fish, the fish at La Sepia will be dull, tasteless and boring. Conclusion: He who travels to the coast of the Mediterranean sea shall have real fish. He who stays in Hamburg should stick to sardines."
3,"Been there for lunch. The decoration is very nice and it feels very cosy. The service is ok, but not as friendly as I would wish for in a restaurant.I ordered a duck curry and was surprised when I received a sour chicken soup as a starter. For lunch I wasn't used to that and it tasted really nice. The main course was also tasty and I can also recommend it for people who want the option to order their dishes ""Thai spicy"".Unfortunately the tast has it's price. About 13€ for a lunch dish is already a premium."
2,"Came here because it was close to my hotel and lookd like a popular place.  It was good but doesn't beat Red Robin IMO.  Anyway, I was looking around and noticed something odd, from an american stand point.  This is what I learned.  Germans eat their burgers with a fork and knife."
3,After fasting for a week i was searching for a place to eat some potatoes. Ordered backed potatoes less oil and some salad with out salad dressing. But it came with oily potatoes and salad dressing. Apart from it lovely place and staff was friendly. I found my basic backed potato dish was reasonable.
4,Excellent food and service. Nice location with plenty of outside seating. Great jazz music and local beer on tap. Strongly recommend.
3,"Nice little French bistro. Cozy and warm on the inside with outdoor seating available on a warm day. Their menu mainly consists of galettes (French savory crêpes), quiches, cheese, some wines and beers. I can't recall the rest but it is mainly French.I had the galette au jambon et fromage; cheese and ham galette. It was very good, the best part being the crunchy well done texture of the crepe. The ham and cheese was good too on there which washed down well with the Reisling that I had. Galette cost 6,90 which is really good especially for the area it is in. I strayed from my standard galette choice of la complète but I'll definitely be coming back to see theirs is like."
4,"This place is amazing. There are three floors of very detailed exhibits. The special exhibit on the history of Germany, a comparison of various time periods, was especially fascinating. I would have enjoyed an accompanying audio tour."
4,This is a tiny private restaurant tucked away on a side street. We picked it because is was close and it had good Yelp ratings. Seating is very tight and people may need to move tables to let you get to your seat. The diners were a mix of locals and European tourists. We were the only Americans. I had the krautspatzle and the others in our group had maultasche gebraten. I thought my  krautspatzle dish was excellent. It was very different from the brats we had been having for lunch. I tried some of my wife's dish and it too was very tasty. Portions were quite large and I could not finish all of my lunch. We would definitely return to this restaurant.
4,"The food was great, the staff were friendly and nice, the place is neat and bright, one of the best Persian restaurant in Europe."
3,"Ventured outside the central Hamburg area just to check out this restaurant. So glad we did! The staff is super friendly and greets you with a welcome Ouzo shot (you also get following dessert). We sat outside and enjoyed the neighborhood feel and summer air. We had a Greek Rosé, which wasn't for me, but everything else was amazing. The grilled octopus starter was hands-down the best octopus I've had in a long time. It is one of my favorite dishes, so I order it often always searching for the best one. Kalliopea does it just right- super tender, but yet perfectly crisp on the outside. The appetizer with a selection of various cold starters is a nice way to sample. The sliced fried potatoes are delicious. If you want soft potatoes, the ones with the ones cooked with herbs are good, too...all around impressed by this little place!"
3,"Fabulous brunch on Sunday! A bit pricy but it includes juices and coffee, so actually just fine.. lots of veggies, warm and cold dishes...... nice service... great bread... all good!"
4,"I've now breakfasted twice at Moraba, and have both times stayed after I finished to study. The best part of this place is their fresh juices  incredible. The breakfasts are also simple, but tasty. As for the local, it is very cozy, has functional Internet, and the service is always very friendly and attentive. Prices are also good for student life. I'm always very pleased when I come, and will continue to go there."
4,"Very friendly staff, delicious food and not too pricy. They brought out olives, bread, and drinks as soon as we got seated and tolerated my terrible German. I've been there three times and I still have yet to try something on the menu that I wasn't very pleased with. Be careful around the bathroom area though, there is a sneaky hidden step and once I missed it and fell. Thankfully no one saw. But I would hate for anyone else to have the same experience."
1,"Disappointment! I have tried their cheesecake before, they are really rich and creamy! But today I decided to try their lunch. Since they went vegan, something has happened to this place. They portions of their cheesecakes have been reduced, and the food options have been limited. The menu says that they offer the best vegan burger in town,  (Honestly, I really really hate to give bad reviews) unfortunately it was really dry and lacked taste. The ""fries"" were also soggy,  so maybe it could be great if instead they could do a salad. Maybe it was a bad day. :)"
3,"Great location, terrific food, tasty drinks. Very pricy but in total worth it. Do make reservations beforehand if you're interested in a table with view."
3,"Solid dishes, impressive drink menu, and good service.Our party of 5 went with the family style approach of sharing a bunch of tapas. It seems like the right amount is somewhere around 2 to 3 tapas per person, probably closer to the 3 end if you're hungry. Food comes out pretty fast, though, so you could always start small and order more later.They have a ridiculous selection of liquors for the size of the restaurant. If they don't have your favorite, you're just way too picky.For a busy Saturday night, service was remarkably attentive and friendly. Our waitress checked in on us a few times as our party arrived (they'll seat you even if your party isn't entirely here yet). We were there with German-speaking friends, so not sure how good the wait staff's English is.The inside isn't large but handles the noise very well. The tables are well spaced out, and we didn't need to shout to hear each other even though the place was packed.Prices are a tad high, especially with the cocktails. I'm still calibrating to the Hamburg market, though, so this could be on par for this kind of establishment. With a cocktail per person and 2 bottles of wine, we ended at just under €40 per person. Makes for a good special dinner spot but probably not a regular option."
3,"My wife and I stopped off a Wednesday around 7PM and the tables were all full, so we grabbed seats at the bar. They had a happy hour running from 6-8PM and we grabbed some buy-one-get-one-free beer and ""atomic"" wings. They had Ratsherrn on tap, which is a local beer I really like. The atomic wings came out pretty quick and the staff was really curious about them. They are incredibly spicy, we did 3 wings each, and were nearly crying. But we like spicy, so it was good thing, but the wings are no joke. We moved on to our second and burgers. I had The Jack, medium-well, drenched with blue cheese. The fries were reasonable, just so-so, but the burger was huge and tasty. The burger buns are muffins, but it's a nice touch; they hold together pretty well, even covered in burger juice.Great place for a beer and a burger. They are really proud of their American beef and I could definitely taste the quality. The service was a little slow at times, but the staff was really friendly overall. I'd go back."
3,I am a bit harsh sometimes: They really improved and Tim and his team are doing a great job.It is a shame I cannot stop by more often.Love their lunch options with seafood!
4,"Nice café just near the Elbphilharmonie. It looks like an old parisian bookstore with its wooden furniture. Really cool style. The other rooms are more commun, I would recommend (if possible) to go to the one which has its door just in front of the Elbphilharmonie."
0,We decided to give this place a second chance.Fortunately we had the same terrible experience like on our previous visit.The food is still terrible and the staff has absolutely no sense for hospitality whatsoever.It's really interesting that the management just responds to positive feedback here on yelp but doesn't seem to care about bad customer experiences and / or how to learn from them.
4,"Great place for lunch, but get here early. It gets very busy by 12pm, but it turns over very fast, so you probably won't have to wait too long.The options seem to change daily and are very fresh. There will always usually be a chicken, ground beef or vegetarian option. I've had some great chicken pho here, but I would eat anything they serve. The staff is really friendly and service is pretty fast; it's really easy to pay and leave."
4,"It's nice to see that these formally vacant wharehouses and been modernised and used as offices, studios and small businesses. Speicherstadt houses Hamburg Dungeons and the impressive indoor model railway. A short walk from Landungsbrucken or a bus ride from the city centre."
3,"Cute place for a breakfast, lunch or dinner... Very friendly associates"
2,"Schöne Location und auch nette Mitarbeiter. Die Preise allerdings sind frech - viel zu teuer, für das, was man bekommt, gerade im Bereich der Kuchen und Torten."
3,"I like to eat lunch here on Mondays and Fridays. Mondays, they usually have noodles, on Fridays, they have fish for today's lunch menu."
2,"Wow, I am glad I didn't pay 25.50 EUROS for this. Online prices are much cheaper. It's fun and has some local Hamburg history tied in which is cool and cruel. The fear and frightening factor is not as severe as I had expected but it's definitely well advised that kids under 10 aren't allowed (allusions to castration as a means of torture) and those 10-14 only with an adult. I saw the German show and much of its wording seemed to be directly translated from English - just didn't sound that natural in German. The acting was pretty good but I didn't like that you had to go through the entire thing with a rather large group of people. It's tight in some of the rooms and you don't have a chance to see everything because it's so crowded. Although it would be a lot more fun if you were allowed to take pictures or they would at least include the initial photo that they take in the entry price. Didn't feel like paying another 10 Euros for it."
4,"Proper Irish  to the point that as an Englishman who grew up in the 70s and 80s I always feel a bit unwelcome. But that is definitely me, not them, so we come here often and if you want guinness, irish stew or great soup it's really good here. They also run a briliant Quiz night and often have irish music going on."
4,Great place to enjoy a hearty breakfast and a nice cappuccino. The place looks nice and the staff is friendly.
4,"Excellent service, atmosphere and food. The Pänang curry crisp duck was perfect. The price was VERY reasonable. The best meal we have had in Hamburg thus far. I wish I had had room for the soups and desserts. Go early or wait long."
2,"Why go to Zoë 3 when Zoë 2 is literally nextdoor? It's a question I've only twice had an answer for. 1) Zoë 2 was too busy to get into2) Zoë 2 was closed, but then we realised that Zoë 3 was too They have upgraded this place recently with the addition of sofas, before that it really was tough to make a case for going in. I'm sure it's a fine bar, but you'll never want to go in."
3,"Such a cool find thanks to my awesome hubby who planned a surprise date here :)Free jazz Mondays (the band was great!), fairly priced drinks, chill crowd all inside an old fire boat-it was a lovely night indeed. I highly recommend checking out Das Fueurschiff!"
2,"Update: I have to take this place down a notch. They are now vegetarian and everything which used to include meat now has some kind of tofu replacement or isn't on the menu anymore. This definitely takes them down a notch when it comes to many breakfast options.....bacon.....you can't take away bacon folks! It's a god-given right!Had breakfast here this morning with a friend and business partner and came away pleasantly surprised. There have been a lot of comments all over the place both on Yelp and Qype about this place. I had been at ""Don't Tell Mama"" in their previous location and really liked the cheesecake but service sucked and the location was a hassle for me. Had meant to come here forever but finally had the chance. I am finnicky about breakfast and very few places in Hamburg do it right. Mamalicious did a pretty good job. The eggs benedict were quite good as was a 3-egg scramble (with dried tomatoes and feta cheese). Coffee was tasty too. I had a fruit smoothie which was so so but I think it was more the mix of fruit verses anything else that didn't let it shine. All in all a nice location with outdoor seating as well (does get loud due to busy street right there). Service was really nice but we were first ones in the door in the morning and it wasn't that busy. Unfortunately, hash browns were out. No idea how something is already out right at opening and found this a bit odd but so be it. All in all we were happy with breakfast and enjoyed the place. I plan on coming back and hope not to find all the gripes which have been mentioned: too loud music, slow service nor missing food items, etc. This place is good but could very easily tip over to mediocre. As long as you get good service and they have everything available you should be happy with this place. Prices are a bit steep too but hopefully you're getting quality for that and they do use organic products (or so they say) and mention having a local, quality butcher for their meat. Let's hope that the second visit is just as good if not better."
3,Very nice Thai restaurant in the Hafencity! Interior is nice and cosy.The menu is great and not too many dishes on there so one can keep a good overview :-)Worth a try
4,"UPDATE 26/2/09 A TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO FORM! OK, I don't often write in capital letters, but without the fantastic pizza everyday, we'd never have got Qype redesigned would we?! Service back to it's good old self, and seem to get free wine everytime. I'm back in love. UPDATE 9/7/08 My my, how things change in the space of a few months! Firstly the 'summer pricing' - to make sure the tourists of historic Deichstrasse pay more, then the service... which has been steadily decreasing in quality for months, till it hit rock bottom today. Yes, I had probably the worst lunch experience of all my lunch experiences in Hamburg thus far! Seven of us sat down to eat, and 2 dishes arrived after maybe 15 minutes. Another 2 after 25 minutes, and the last three? A whopping 45 minutes after! I might add the fact that I had to get these myself from the kitchen, or that my cutlery was literally thrown down onto the table when I asked for some... but you don't need to know all that. I already warned 3 people off on the way in - now I'm telling you Qypers - don't eat here, ever! ****************Well being as it's opposite work, I do eat here a lot! The pizzas started out passable but when we pulled a late one the other week they pulled out all the stops and made some exceptional stuff that really good the Qype relaunch back on track. The pasta is usually very good, and beats Vapiano, without having to wait for 30 mins too. Service-wise, it's very friendly, and they're accommodating for large parties of hungry developers. I must stress, the conditions in the video don't particularly represent normality, but it was so funny eating whilst the building was collapsing around us yesterday, that I had to film it...Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=gJTr…"
4,"Great food, large portions, reasonable prices and a quaint old world setting make Thämers the go-to restaurant in this area.What I like the most is the ambiance. It is dark and rustic. Whether with a group of friends or alone with a book, it is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. There isn't a great deal of sitting space inside, so if you are coming at prime time it is a gamble if they will be able to seat you.Favorite dishes here were the pan fish and the pork chop. Both come with a side of fried potatoes, which are very tasty. Potions on all the dishes were hearty.The staff is welcoming, and with a drink the average price is somewhere around €15 for dinner."
0,"I have been to another Chinese Loving Hut in London, and this one was very disappointing. We went for lunch time, got the lunch deal (spring rolls or soup + a plate on the reduced menu for 6.90€). The tables weren't clean and we had to wait for 25 minutes before anyone came to get our order, but so far so good, I can live with that for the sake of good food for such a price! Sadly, our entries arrived (one soup and spring rolls) and they were barely warm. Our main course also looked re-heated. It wasn't hot, the texture of my sauce was as if the gelatine used to thicken had been cooled down and then re-heated, which caused it to be way too thick and glumpy - not good. The menu advertised that I would get seitan, though it really looked like a can mock-duck to me. The fried rice was tasty still, they can have that. We got our drinks halfway through the main course. Overall, it seems that depending on what you order, it's a hit or miss."
3,"Pretty decent little St. Pauli pub in Eimsbuttel. It gets packed when there's a game on. For the nice summer days they have a large number of benches and tables outside, allowing Urknall to double as a bier garden"
3,"A very nice place in a fast changing Barmbek, Hamburg.  We had Flammkuchen (German/French pizza without tomato base) and it was very nice.  Nice beer from draft and service very friendly (we were served by Korean-German waitress and she was very helpful).  TRUDE is located near the Osterbekkanal right next to a very interesting museeum (museum of work: where else outside of Germany could you find such a museum ...?). There are other typical German, but also international and vegetarian options on the menu.  At night a nice place to sit outside."
4,"If you plan to visit Takumi, you should definitely come 15 - 20 minutes before its opening hours. The tables are arranged for 2-4 persons. We have been 8 people and the staff let us rearrange the tables so we can all sit together. The waiters were very considerate of the customers, so we didn't really habe to wait for one to take our orders. Even though we have been a big group, the food arrived very fast and everyone got their ramen at the same time. I ordered  'Karaage' and the 'Yuzu Shio Ramen' with soybean sprouts and an egg. The karaage was a decent portion for an entree. I was pretty amazed by the ramen. The soup base and the noodles were very delicious! I wasn't a big fan of the egg though because it was pretty cold. To sum it up, I would definitely recommend anyone who is looking for some delicious ramen to pay Takumi a visit!"
4,The best fucking Turkish food in Hamburg. I've been trying different places all week and non of them can compare to here. They use real tandoori ovens and charcoal grill it's truly fucking amazing. Plus the owner is so nice and speaks English. If you're in Hamburg this place is a must I could eat here daily.
3,"We went here once for breakfast and in my opinion it is a very good price for the tasty breakfast. Another time I tried the pizza, it was a little small in my opinion. The staff was very nice and helpful. One downside was that the street was a bit noisy."
4,"I an American from SD in the area for business.  I found this bar through Yelp.  I came on a Monday night and it was cozy and mostly empty.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The beer was great, the food was ok but I wasn't expect much for bar food. I returned on Thursday and the place was packed with locals.  The staff was different but still friendly.   It's a great place to hangout especially since there is not much else in the neighborhood."
1,"Maybe it was because I was set on having an authentic California burrito experience that I was left so unsatisfied. I ordered the chicken burrito and knew what to expect in terms of presentation based on all the pictures on Yelp--wrapped in paper instead of foil and grilled. That's different, but no biggie. I was, for some reason, expecting to pick up the burrito and eat it like normal with my hands, but alas it was too overstuffed and soggy to do so. The mixture of the lettuce, rice, beans, and salsa tasted good, but the chicken lacked flavor. My hubby ordered the enchilada, which was a burrito smothered in mole sauce. The mole sauce was way too chocolatey, like milk chocolate was used in the sauce chocolatey.Yes, I know we live in Hamburg now and I shouldn't expect the same flavorful, meat and rice cooked in lard wrapped neatly in a heavenly package of greasy goodness...The place was quite crowded when we arrived but we were able to grab a booth in the corner. There is high turn over here, so you may only need to wait a little bit  for a free table. I did enjoy the luchadora theme decor. I don't think I'd come back any time soon, but if a hankering for a burrito or Mexican food  manages to overpower me, I'd give Jim Burrito another try."
4,"bok is an asian self-service restaurant close to Altona train station. The prices are fair, the food is average, but very edible. The dishes are quite big, and in contrary to other chinese food places the amount of glutamate is a decent one. The quality suffered a bit in the last months, but it's still tasty there, so walk in, order a kimchi soup and duck with peanut sauce, and then just enjoy. =)"
4,"As everyone knows...I'm addicted to great coffee!! And this is the place to find it. At first I was worried that it was a tourist coffee company and I was happily wrong. The coffee is super strong and fantastic. I was in town with my husband visting a friend and we came here multiple times during our visit. Almost filled the entire stamp card. And I'm also a sucker for a stamp card. I definitely enjoy the cafe itself as well. It's very modern and plenty of space. The service is very friendly. The waitress insisted that I sit down and that I could pay later. The culture in Europe is definitely to not be rushed and sit an enjoy the break in the day. Also who can't be in love with the ""Deathspresso"" icon and slogan!! ""Schlafen kannste du wann du tot bist"", ""You can sleep when you're dead!""Wach auf Hamburg!!"
1,"It is what it is. It's an easy spot, but the food isn't stellar. It's affordable but tastes like so so delivery food."
2,their pasta and pizza of the day with Apple soda during lunch time is a good deal (around 6 to 7 eur).
2,We went here due to the yelp reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as expected. The food was only ok and the waitress didn't speak German or English. With a lot of pointing at the menu we got the food we wanted. I guess that during the week there is more staff and the food is better.
4,"Loved this place! Shabby chic all the way! What a cool concept, so comfy it's like sitting on your sofa at home but with the added benefit of table service! The baileys coffee was luuuuuuvly."
4,"Wow! So good! Don't make the mistake I did when I was new in the city and eat at the bus terminal, walk about 5 mins to here and eat like a king. My favorite was Adona kebab."
3,"I cycled to Volkspark for the first time this weekend, and while a lot of the park is relatively uncared for, there is some great woodland and nice paths for walking, jogging or cycling. I should mention that it's not suitable for roadbikes - a mountain bike would be best. The woodland here was actually more fun to cycle around than that in the nearby Niendorfer Gehege forest, and there are some reasonably sized hills. Almost part of the park is the Dahliengarten which is incredibly well cared for, and I assume from walking around it has probably the biggest collection of Dahlia flower species in the world. Also just on the edge of the park is the Hauptfriedhof Altona (main Altona cemetery), which is also nice to walk around. Overall, I think it's a better park for cycling, jogging or walking the dog than actually using as a standard park - most of Volkspark is forested."
3,"Surprisingly good food. Don't expect any kind of fine dining and the area is horrible outside the door.....it's gentrifying but still a good ways away from being hip. Nevertheless, the food is solid and tasty. Service is quite fast as well and by the amount of people coming in here, you can tell that you are not the first to find this restaurant. Also, the tin serving trays will remind you of prison food. We got a kick out of this but I am sure some people will be put off. Cleanliness is also not necessarily their forte. Note, I don't mean to say the place is dirty or unsanitary. It's simply not polished but in my opinion, that's fine. As long as the food is good, you don't worry about it being unfresh and the prices are fair, a great lunch spot. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to get here and there are other good Indian places in the area as well. If you live or work nearby as I do, definitely hit this place up. It's worth it."
2,"We ate here at lunch time. It was busy but as we arrived early we were served speedily. I enjoyed my meal and the waiter was friendly. Ok its not the best Italian restaurant I have visited but if you are nearby and want something pleasant to eat , it will fit the bill"
3,I've been here several times for breakfast or lunch and their food is always great. They are open late but I've never tried their dinner menu. They also have free wifi available so you can have a coffee or tea and surf the net.
3,The food at this place is great and creative! I guess one of the most fun kitchens and quality on the Lange Reihe... With regards to service they can definitely improve and I leave it at that... The restaurant is simply worth a visit!!!
3,"Wonderful place with great service. Enjoyed the fine dining very much and great staff added more value. We had salad, stake, Schnizel and cheese collection with a bottle of fine wine. It was lovely and cozy to watch the first snow for Hamburg. Recommend to go and get ready for a beautiful lake view."
4,"I have definitely reviewed the Hafenbahnhof before. But since Qype doesn't remember, here I go again! It feels like miles away although certain people may argue it's not, it is. But don't let that put you off. Great views of the docks out of the windows whilst you sip a cold astra and watch Hamburg's very own Ricky Kings play. It's all good."
4,Spaghetti Eis is da best. Also the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had.
3,"If you are in any kind of hurry, just go ahead and avoid this place. We had all the time in the world on Sunday morning so were okay with food taking quite some time. It's a neat little breakfast joint that reminds me of several places we've gone to and loved back in the States. We both got the 3-egg scramble with toast and home fries. My husband got tomatoes, mozz, spinach and mushrooms and I got sun-dried tomatoes, feta and spinach in mine and we both loved our dishes. Kinda nice that you can get as many veggies inside as you want! The jam served with the toast was delicious, as were the home fries. It was nice to see a menu with eggs different ways (especially eggs Benedict!). I don't even know the last time I had fresh OJ, so that was also a pleasant surprise! We both said we would come back here and recommend it to others, as well."
3,Very nice and ... Thai atmosphere. Good service and very good food. Expensive but quality kitchen.
3,"A lovely place to spend a summer's day. Swim, sunbathe, take a boat trip, visit the planetarium or sit in Schumacher's beer garden. Also a concert venue. nice for outdoor concerts although they have to finish by 10pm."
2,Nice little cafe where you can grab a selection of teas and snacks along with some typical main dishes of pastas etc.Nice areas to sit and chat or if you are by yourself grab a paper and catch up on the worlds going on.
4,Great experience and great food. Would recommend. Get the tasting menu! Reasonable compared to other places. Not pretentious.
2,Everything was decent here- quite good non-dolsot bi bim bap (ie the less expensive option not served in a hot stone bowl) with ample namul sides. Problem is really the pricing- 15 euros for the dolsot option is more like $21 Canadian and that's just not worth it. If I lived in Hamburg and were desperate for Korean I'd make a beeline but I can't see coming back when there are better and cheaper options back home. Service was fast and very friendly.
4,"Das Terzetto ist zu meinem Stammitaliener geworden. Ich habe dort schon meine Eltern, fast alle meiner Freunde und auch Kollegen hingeführt. Das Essen ist wirklich außerordentlich gut, der Service typisch italienisch ;-) und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis absolut in Ordnung.In der dazugehörigen Bar nebenan habe ich kürzlich zusammen mit einer Freundin unseren Geburtstag mit 40 Leute gefeiert (geschlossene Gesellschaft). Unsere Wünsche wurden alle erfüllt. :-)) Würde ich wieder machen!"
3,"Great, real Austrian place. You come for the Schnitzel and you return for the Schnitzel. Authentic menu with everything you'd expect from the Austrians from Nocken via Zwetschge to Kaiserschmarn. Obviously consistently good since the place still fills up in the evenings. Make sure to reserve. The smaller schnitzel is sufficient but if you're really hungry, go for the large one. It will satisfy. Service was also super nice and you could see they all care. We went home happy and will be back, sooner than later. My favorite schnitzel is still at Casse Croute in Hamburg but this place is a very close second and literally just a smidgen less good."
4,This is a great place to go to relax and have couple of cocktails in summer. It really shines when the weather is great and you can take of your shoes. It's a bit crowded so you may have to wait till you get a place to crash. Mojitos they make are awesome!
4,"Although I had I pretty bad flu since the week before, I couldnt resists to join this event. Even though it appeared to be my first night as the Qype City Night host. So after all I joined the group around twentyhundret-and-a-bit: a bunch of more than 25 heads, that made their way to the GOLDEN, a place being criticized in november last year by myself in a pretty harsh but discussable way. Therefore I was pretty excited how both - the restaurantsowner and the qype community - would reflect on the upcoming event. Bearing a pretty poor stomach for almost a week in mind, I decided to choose from the menu, beginning with a chinese mushroom soup with chicken. Great choise! Delicious and tasty. Then there was some Dim Sums and in the end another shark-fin-soup (what-so-ever the english equivalent may be called). Please refer to both english and german feedbacksregarding the GOLDEN. As I dont like to edit my german comment from november `06, I have to get the GOLDEN five stars and two-thumbs-up from this end. That night was awesome! Thanks to Mr. Wong."
4,"The Bird could use a little more atmosphere, but it's early days and the food and the staff are just so awesome, it deserves the full five stars. Sadly though I think the sheer class of the Bird is a bit wasted on the Hamburgers, with their naff Croques and Jim Blocks. This is greasy, hearty Americana at it's best. Spread the word."
4,"The food is very fresh at a really good price. But the best part is the service. Good wines, clean and easy to get there.It is better to make reservations because the place is very small.Everybody is very friendly. Highly recommended."
3,Pretty nice venue for spending time with your friend enjoying some sports or a fancy night in he beach!!Regarding sports they have volleyball courts and beach tennis courts as well!They also have a bar downstairs for drinks in case you thirsty form your activities!Changing rooms are big and ithe lockers you can fit pretty much all your stuff!They also have sauna!! Suggested! ;-)
3,"This place is great for some quick and authentic Indian food. It is buried in a street full of hostels and consequently other nightlife offerings :) Order at the register and receive a buzzer for when your food is ready. I got the Gobi Pakoras and Lamm Curry Thali with the Mango Lassi. The Mango lassi was sweet and offset the meal which was equally as good. I can't imagine the health rating on the restaurant would receive 100% but if a little realness in food preparation and presentation doesn't bother you, you'll love the food!"
4,This is one of very few specialist coffee shops in Hamburg and they do a perfect job.... Their 'First Love' espresso is prob the best origin blend espresso I've tasted
4,Nice restaurant!!! The food is delicious and cheap.
4,"I really loved this place. It is cooler than probably any bar i've ever been to in london and it was really cheap with really friendly fast service. The best bit about it is that you can play extreme table football in the back and then when you're tired head into the bedroom for a quick snooze. There's even a blanket, and no one seems to mind if you do sleep, unlike london where you can get chucked out of a club for closing your eyes. Very chilled and very nice."
3,"Cool bar on Bartelsstraße in the Schanze district of Hamburg. It's quite dark, with semi-comfy leather seating around the edges of the room, and inoffensive beats. The main attraction on a Tuesday night is the happy hour cocktails until 2200. I have to stress that happy hour in Germany is not the same as the UK - they are not half price. You're talking around EUR 4.50 for a caprhina and slightly more for a mojito - but they are very very good cocktails. You can order at the bar and then get them brought over to you, so you are free to enjoy the trippy electronic fish tank! This is the centrepiece of the bar, and has shallow water in which you can put your fingers and get the fish to chase you! I've never seen anything like it..."
2,Went there for lunch with some colleagues and had the Tiki Burger with baked potatoes and a coke light.The meal arrived quickly in under 10 minutes.The Burger was good but not in my top 10 and the baked potatoes could be a little bit more crispy.The price for the  meal and one drink was 12 Euro and they allow to split the bill.
3,"Good steak house. They have large fresh salads, and the garlic bread is awesome. But the steaks are lean, well prepared, and the service is good for a German restaurant - which means efficient but not overly friendly, and certainly not casual. They have some nice beers on taps, and a rather good selection of wine as well. They serve deserts, but I prefer to go to some place else like a nice coffee shop to have a pot of tea and maybe some straddle. Or to one of the awesome chocolate shops around. I eat here every time I am in Hamburg."
4,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Hamburg. Excellent coffee, warm service and a tiny discount if you bring your own cup :))"
4,"Excellent seafood with very affordable price, cannot ask for more! But mind the steps if you're traveling with difficult mobility."
3,"Great bar, with a crowd which can be most aptly described as resembling ""Shoreditch without the skinny jeaned, floppy haired, fixed gear riding wankers"". Really chilled atmosphere, lots of comfortable sofas, and reasonably priced drinks (2.5EUR for an Astra). Deserves special mention for being the first bar I've visited that sported a semi-conscious dog lying at the feet of its owner!"
3,"Had a very relaxing evening there. The service was professional and friendly. The wines that I tried an the drinks my friend had were all good. The munchies were very good (sweet potatoe fries and a flamkuchen). When the weather turns wet or colder, the inside is spacious and well designed. It's next to a museum and not in a very scenic area of Hamburg (of which there many...). But still very nice. I highly recommend it."
3,"There aren't too many wine bars around Hamburg, but the Südhang is one. It's pretty hidden while at the same time being in the middle of the Schanze. You have to walk 5m off the main road towards the entrance to the wine shop, then enter the wine shop, and then go up the stairs. The menu isn't extensive, consisting mostly of pasta and salad dishes, but there should also be a few bigger meals advertised on teh blackboard. I had a pleasant time there last night. I'll probably be back."
0,"Currywurst ohne Pommes? 5,90 Euro für eine größere Wurst? Kein vernünftiges Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis."
3,"Delicious Pakistani food and great service (which is completely unexpected in Germany!) This is one of several locations in the city and my favorite because you can either have a nice sit-down meal in the gorgeous restaurant or have a quick meal in the little ""imbiss"" (snack) on the right side. The restaurant is beautiful with carved wood, lit candles, tiled walls and flooring, and the choice of sitting at tables with chairs or on cushions on the ground. In the snack side you can order from essentially the same menu although it it much cheaper  and a little quicker. Great curries and platters, yummy cocktails, and quick and friendly service. Definitely recommended."
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90.Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel.Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
4,This place never fails to deliver amazing authentic Indian food. Great samosas. The dip that comes with the samosas are delicious. Their food has just the right amount of spice. Good portions with very reasonable prices.
4,"I have a fairly high bar for a food establishment to get a 5-star rating. I don't eat out a ton but, when I do, it's with the expectation of having an experience that I couldn't easily replicate at home (for half the cost and no travel time).We went to TrüffelSchwein to celebrate Valentine's Day. Even though it fell on a Sunday (when they're normally closed), they opened up for the special day and had a custom menu going. The dishes were mostly pulled from their regular menus with some customizations here and there. Still, points for opening on Sunday and printing a themed menu.Ambience: perfect. The dining room is intimate but gives each table enough room to have its own conversation. They have an outdoor space, but it was (1) February in Hamburg and (2) pouring rain. I'm sure it's amazing in the summer, though. The decor is relaxed upscale, not that I'm-rich-look-at-me feel that you'll find in most other Michelin-rated restaurants in Hamburg. It's classy yet comfortable, a nice-jeans-and-blazer vibe. For the occasion, they had rose petals on the tables, a perfectly elegant touch.Service: nailed it. That alone earns them their Michelin star for me. Their timing and delivery are impeccable. They're there to top off your water or wine seconds before you realize you need a refill. The courses are perfectly spaced out and presented. They give you space to enjoy your dining experience but magically show up moments before you even notice you need something. When our waitress heard us speaking English (and clearly butchering any German we spoke with her), she smoothly switched over to English without any hesitation. When we continued in German ('cause we're stubborn fools), she switched back again without missing a beat. Top notch professionalism, folks.Food: everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and superbly plated. We went for the 4-course menu paired with gin martinis and a white wine, which was just the perfect amount. That menu includes a bread basket with truffle butter and tapenade and two amuse-bouches.When it comes to higher-end restaurants, TrüffelSchwein is absolutely worth the splurge, more so than the 185€ you'd have to shell out at Haerlin just for food in my book. I look forward to returning to TrüffelSchwein in the future."
2,"Stopped here after dinner a couple of time, completely full on Fridays and Saturdays. loud music and place for smokers. it is a nice place to hang out in this neighborhood in summer with outdoor seating."
3,"Amazing displays, super crowded, but a fun place for kids and adults. Def. book advanced tickets. There's a helpful charging stations with all kinds of cords to plug your phone in if you have exhausted its battery by taking too many pictures, lol."
1,"It's big, it's tacky, but it's on the Reeperbahn, so that's kinda expected. One thing that you might not expect is that it would be quite so expensive. A weizen here will set you back a whopping EUR3.90! Before 8pm cocktails are EUR5.50, which is ok. I can't see any other reason for coming in though"
2,"So you telling me that chicken in chipotle sauce, beans, rice, salsa verde, creme freshe, rucola, tomatoes and onions, queso blanco and God know how many more optional ingridients on aflat bread are supposed to be a good food??? Yes, it doesn't taste bad, but I call it put all possible latin-flavoured ingredients together, name it Californian and sell in busy locations in Hamburg, Germany. Success guaranteed.I really hope people don't think this is Californian cuisine. I also hope that this trend (don't want to call it American, but looks like it's coming from there) of highly personalized, overwhelming choice food will fade away."
3,Cafe Mexico is a nice little Mexican restaurant just to the north of the Schanze. I had the chilli con carne burrito and was quite surprised when something that I would have recognised as enchiladas was presented to me. Definitely different to the Americanised burrito places that are starting to pop-up around Hamburg. If you like tequila then (I assume) this is definitely a place to visit seeing as they have about 100 different types A nice touch is the complementary shot of tequila before you leave.
2,"Amusing evening in this cavernous new St Pauli Sushi place.The deal is, you pay a fixed price and can stay for two and half hours, order 10 items every 20 minutes, so there are a few limitations. We were told that it is very rare for anyone to order the full amount, potentially 200 items! But it has been known to happen.Each table is equipped with a red ipad, you order and the dishes start arriving thick and fast, 10 at a time. First we went for salads, all very fresh and delicious, particularly the seaweed salad, and I made a mental note to have more. Twenty minutes later, we ordered the next round, this time warm dishes, all very good and very fresh as you would expect from a place with this rapid a turn around. Highlights were grilled fish.Next round, more or the same, some of the grilled items were delectable, yet came in small portions.Still going strong, we started on the sushi, here there was a slight difference in quality between the hand rolls and the smaller sushi, which I suspect were machine made, so we opted to continue with the fresher hand rolls.This continued until the fifth round when our appetites began to flag, but hey, you do the maths 5 rounds equals 50 items per table of two. No small achievement!Drinks were slightly expensive, but they had some excellent beer on tap.With an offer from Groupon, the total cost of this feast was just over Eu 30, not bad I would say.Service was friendly, efficient and informal.Bottom line, this is not really a sushi restaurant, more of a Pan-Asian, fun house! Don't go there expecting Sushi artistry, you won't find it. What you'll find is a lively venue for a fun evening! Great for a small group, I'd say.I'd go again, but only with an offer!"
4,"I've been coming to Oma's ever since I came to Hamburg, and it's one of my favourites. They do a mean steak, huge burgers and good frühstuck (continental breakfast). They also show the football sometimes (see if you can spot the screen, it's very well hidden). The beer is a bit pricey, but it's more of a restaurant than a bar.."
3,"Always busy, always full like most Burger restaurants nowadays. You should always plan with a 15-20min wait. The waitress takes your name and calls you up when a table is free. They are very quick and friendly. The burgers are very yummy and the food arrives fast. The only thing I miss when I eat here is that they don't really have dessert. They also have a small selection of cocktails but I wish they had more or at least that they were a bit bigger for the price..."
1,"Maybe I came to this place with really high hopes because I was really let down with the food. I ordered a burrito with guacamole and asked for it to be inside the burrito and instead I got it on the side which is fine (maybe slight language barrier). When I got my food I was excited to see how massive the burrito was! One thing I notices is that they seem to toast them so it looked more like a Panini than a burrito. Then came the other big mistake, the burrito was extremely soggy! You couldn't pick it up and had to use a knife and a fork. Never have I been served a burrito that needs to be eaten that way. Anyway, it tasted pretty ok but the watery part in the middle kind of ruined the flavors. The guacamole was ok!"
3,"Qrito: Original Californian Cuisine. They have burritos, quesadilla and tacos which you can fill with a wide choice of meat.Either with minced meat, finely chopped meat, orange/lime chicken, chocolate/nuts beef, and of course pork meet. Rice is also added, either lime or spanish, and a variety of vegetables and a sauce of your choice. It's a nice place, with an original idea.The Burrito and Quesadilla are HUGE. you need to be really hungry to eat it up!"
2,"I was hoping to see the (low) standard of service that we encountered in Bavaria get better as we dined in Hamburg but it was not so. Service here was definitely slow and not very attentive. Our waiter spoke fine English and that part of the meal went well, but engaging him to get our order placed was a bit challenging.Yes, they have a printed menu. It's in German. There's also a list of daily specials on the board, written in German that we could sort of read. Google Translate doesn't work well when you can't work out what the letters are. And then, there's another list of specials that the waiter has in his head, which is... interesting.I let him talk me into a mushroom salad starter which was unusual and quite delicious. A variety of grilled mushrooms, shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Enough for two to share.For main course, I chose the spaghetti vongole. Very good, a plate of pasta tossed in olive oil and garlic and then topped with cherry tomatoes, clams, shrimp and other seafood. Other than the pasta was perhaps a little underdone (or my taste for it is off?), it was delicious and I ate nearly the whole thing. Keto? Not today!My friend had the pappardelle with a beef and veal sauce. She said it was delicious but pointed out that there was no parmesan cheese to be had anywhere. And once she pointed that out, it was strange. Our waiter wasn't to be seen after the food was delivered so after waiting a bit, we decided to dig in. By the time we spotted him, there wasn't much point.So what could have been a five star meal dropped to just three because the pasta was underdone (in my opinion) and the lack of service which just left us underwhelmed.Note: There is Trattoria da Enzo and they have another Trattoria Due Da Enzo around the corner.[Review 12053 overall, 1836 of 2019.]"
3,"Cozy coffeehouse near points of interest in Hamburg! The atmosphere was warm and bright, and the caramel macchiato was well worth the long wait.That was our only complaint; the shortage of servers made our wait very long, first to put in our order, and then even longer to get our drinks. At least it was a respite from the gray, rainy Saturday outside, and I would get another large caramel macchiato from them anytime! (Well, anytime that I have plenty of time to wait;).)"
2,"My colleagues in our Hamburg office wanted Asian food delivered during our working lunch.  Being from San Francisco, again, I was hesitant with Asian food in Germany.  Also, Bok is an eclectic Asian restaurant, serving sushi, Thai food, and some hints of Chinese food.  I played it safe and went with the fried tofu with veggies.  Honestly, the fried tofu and veggies weren't bad at all.  Delicate pieces of fried tofu with fresh assorted veggies and a light gravy.  I had a bite of my colleague's fried chicken and it was enjoyable as well.  It came with a side of a sweet sauce, but I didn't use any of the sweet sauce.  If you're craving for Asian food in Hamburg, Bok isn't a bad choice."
4,"Best Döner in Town! The service is great, always smiling faces, delicious meat and chicken döner, big portions.Döner Tüte is highly recommended!;)They have also great snacks like börek..."
3,"If you're in Ottensen at 5am and want to go to a lively bar, well, you don't have many choices. Familien Eck would be one though. Maybe one of the reasons is that it's pretty tiny, so it doesn't need that many people to be lively :) It's basically a dive bar, and a fair percentage of the crowd will probably be quite alternative/punky looking. Everyone is nice though, and the drinks are a reasonable price. One noteworthy thing is that to save space they have the DJ working almost on the ceiling! It's hard to describe, so you'll just have to see for yourself."
3,The cakes are a delight for the eyesI ve tried only a tiny one filled with nuts and chocolate and it reached my bliss pointI will definitely try other pastriesOn the -side:the neighborhood is not exactly engaging and I wouldnt necessarily want to seat because I dont think i fit in but definitely worth a visit for a take away cake
3,"Pretty awesome salads! Best I've had so far in hamburg. I had the 'Zeigenkäse' salad which is a goat's cheese and honey salad with some grains, cranberries and a mix of lettuce. I picked the sweet chili orange sauce. All in all a very good and very filling salad. All the ingredients complemented each other well. The large size is really large. I was pleased.About the place: It's a salad bar with the option of picking your base, couple of ingredients (grains, cranberries etc) and your protein (chicken, halloumi or goats cheese) and a dressing. Alternatively you can instead pick one of their preexisting salads. Basically your standard salad bar; these are unfortunately uncommon here"
3,"It seems kinda weird that I'm writing the first (English) review of the main Hamburg beach. But I guess there's not all that much to say: It's a sandy beach on the banks of the Elbe in Hamburg. A few notes:- A nice way to get here is to take the ferry from Landungsbrucken.- Be careful when you're near the water's edge. See that container ship going past in the distance? It moves a lot of water, and can cause some surprising waves- There are permanent barbeques on the beach.- There are public toilets- There are restaurants nearby"
3,"Full on a tuesday evening!We just had a quick beer there.The bar is really laidback, cool. there are tables outside and inside.Its around 5 mins away by foot from the busy schulterblatt, in a very quite street.There are two rooms: smoking and non smoking.Although i didnt eat, the people sitting on the table next to me had ordered a burger. I was drooling over it. it looked so delicious! (costs 7EUR60, with salad and fries on the side and free ketchup!) next time im there, im definitely having it!"
4,"BEST RESTAURANT IN HAMBURG...and maybe the world :-) I have eaten here a few times, as it is close to my place, and it is an amazing experience each and every time !!The food is always superb, and (counter-intuitively) the staff are friendly, warm, and welcoming, yes, even if you are a large party, normally dressed, and with a crying baby (what can I say, we like to push the limits). It is truly one of my favorite places to eat in the ENTIRE world, and will keep coming back even if I have to move from HBG."
3,"The service was not great...we got there and just stood waiting to be acknowledged for about 15 minutes. They were super busy and finally someone came to take our names down. The seating is uncomfortably close to your neighbor, hardly any personal space. The only good thing was the food."
4,"Hamburg has 3-4 very good steakhouses. Meatery is easily the best. The quality of the meat is amazing, the tartars too and most of the other dishes I've tried. The side dishes are perfectly executed as well (the reblochon potato gratin, the very light onion rings and the mushrooms are to die for ). But the meat is definitely the star, cooked to perfection at the desired level of doneness."
4,I just found this coffee place and checked it! I had a cappuccino and a piece of their homemade cheesecake. The cheesecake was very good. Homemade and with a coconut flavor. The topping was strawberry jam but im not sure if homemade. Anyway the cheesecake was awesome!! Lovely place and friendly service!
3,"(this applies to any Bok location)  great and fast food, especially the Thai curries and mango salad! Made fresh without MSG. Great light taste, and a good value. Highly recommended for a quick Asian meal. The Bok in the Sternschanze is a bit more average rather than budget priced, but has an expanded menu and really excellent food."
2,"Due to some stellar (German) Qype reviews I was eager to visit Speisekammer this saturday - and left somewhat disappointed. Food is decent, but priced a bit too ambitiously for what one gets. My Caesar Salad, for example, was perfectly edible, but yet another German variation of the theme instead of a ""proper"" Caesar. My friend's breakfasts weren't exactly spectacular, what with a rather bland assortment of cheeses and not very appetising food garnish. All this means Speisekammer doesn't exactly end up on my ""avoid"" list, but given disproportionality of prices and the quality of food on offer I feel no urge to go there again in the future."
3,"Delicious burgers and amazing cheesecake. They weren't really lying when they advertise the cheesecake as being the best in the world. Oh, and some pretty good beer here too.When it's crowded you can expect to wait quite awhile to get your food (like almost an hour...so it's best to be in good company and feel like drinking a couple of beers), but when it's not you'll receive your food in a reasonable amount of time.We've tried a number of burgers here, The Rock (my fav so far), the Filthy Harry, Da Woiks, The Jack (which has blue cheese dressing(?)), and the Dr. Zian. All of the burgers are served on toasted English muffins and the meat patties are juicy, flavorful, and as big as a baseball! The burgers are also served with a generous amount of tasty fries.My rules to adhere to when dining here: if it's too crowded then leave (unless you don't mind waiting a long time to get your food), but if it's not too bad and you can easily find a seat, then you should really dine here."
4,This is probably the best place for tasty food and amazing cakes in the world! You really need to try the hot cocoa!
0,Qrito would have been an even better if they didn't charge people a euro for ten grams of jalapeños! A pretty bad experience don't think I'll go back again. But go on I am sure the burritos won't give you much more than gas.
4,"Great food , don't mind the waiters they might be pushy but at the end they are dealing with a language barrier, other than that even the price was great"
3,"This little beach bar is a Hamburg institution. Little did I know when I got there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon that they're actually open year-round. You can't really miss it as it's located in an old hut right at the beach Övelgönne.With 37F out there people were sunbathing (wrapped in their jackets like Eskimos, of course) and it's clear that this is one of Hamburg's hot spots to chill (or walk the beach).Strandperle serves coffee & tea, as well as soups and snacks. It's usually packed but the line moved quickly when I was there.I admit that I'm a tourist in Hamburg but this place is on my list whenever I'm back in the city."
4,"Parlament is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in the basement of the equally beautiful town hall building in Hamburg. The restaurant is dark and romantic, with amazing architectural details, commanding furniture, candlelit tables, and a gorgeous, illuminated full bar in the center of the enormous room. I came here with two friends from Hamburg who speak German as their native language and were able to request an easy-to-read English menu for me. Parliament has a liquor menu but I opted for just still water, saving my calories for the delicious food. I opted for currywurst which is made with lamb and dressed in a rich, brown, curry-laden sauce and served with a generous side of thick, fresh steak fries. My dinnermates ordered the same and we were brought a pot of mayonnaise for dipping our fries (though this is obviously quite standard in Hamburg, it is not something we do in America and though foreign to me, I totally got on board with mayo as a condiment for fries and ended up enjoying it on more than one occasion). The service was as expected in Germany - never cloying, well-paced, and unrushed. This would be a fantastic place to bring a date or to enjoy a leisurely dinner with friends."
3,"I like Thämers. It offers a friendly, beery old-style pub ambience without a hint of oompahpah or that sneaking suspicion that they're putting it on just for you. Much more personality than the other offerings at Großneumarkt. Food is hearty but good (mountains of bratkartoffeln with everything!) and I find myself coming back here often for dinner and to sit and read outside over a beer and enjoy the balmy summer evenings."
3,"Unglaublich groß. Man sollte mit viel Zeit hingehen, um die ganzen kleinen Details wirklich erkennen zu können. Leider war es extrem voll als ich dort war. Eine Wartezeit von über einer Stunden ist wohl auch normal. Aber für Fans ein MUSS!"
4,"This vegan restaurant made my Hamburg experience so much better! The food was amazing, with a great selection of different food all for a very reasonable price. The staff was wonderful, and the place was decorated with a very cute theme. The bathrooms downstairs were really nice and chock-full of amenities. I will definitely be coming back here!"
4,"Trüffelschwein is a restaurant that is well deserving of its Michelin star (I personally would give it two), and we have now been feeling extra lucky to know how close we live to it and how amazing food-art is just a stone's ""throw away,"" as long as their is plenty of ""disposable"" income lying around. ;o)In all seriousness, a meal here is without question worth the price tag and was certainly one of the best fine dining meals we've had. It is also definitely a place worthy of milestone celebrations so it was the perfect spot to celebrate my wife's birthday. There were a number of options for the amount of courses to partake in, five to be exact, and we opted for the 7 course degustation which really came out to 11 courses after the amazing amuse bouche and dessert extras.1st beef tartare-cucumber-gin: tasty and very well balanced, also came with two pieces of steak to grill on a tiny personal grill.2nd prawn-pork belly-couscous-saffron: excellently prepared prawn over fork-tender pork belly and savory fine couscous, it was one of my favorites.3rd stuffed cabbage-truffle-truffle jus: this dish was completely covered in decadent truffle shavings. 4th pineapple vanilla sorbet-champagne: excellent palate cleanser before the main.  5th iberico pork-truffle-celery-almonds: our main course had so many different delicious elements to it, my wife called it ""a journey on a plate""...apt.6th aperol spritz to eat: amazing frozen aperol with a lot of sweet and delectable surprises in it like fruit and candied things.7th frozen goat cheese-tarragon-white chocolate-olive oil: sensational dessert that was almost too pretty to eat and despite many of the savory elements, it was still quite sweet and was easily one of my most favorite desserts ever. 8th birthday cake!One thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the fact that we weren't really sure how everything was going to taste ahead of time. There were a lot of new flavor combinations and surprises for our palates which I really enjoyed.Overall, the food was excellent and beautifully and artfully plated. Service was fantastic. We both really enjoyed our entire dining experience and hopefully won't be waiting as long as we did to dine here again."
3,"I went to Marseille several months ago as part of a work dinner with some colleagues. Since being diagnosed with celiac, it is always up to me to pick a restaurant, and I chose Marseille because there seemed to be relatively little with wheat in most of the dishes (focusing more on meat, fish, and vegetables). I asked when making the reservation if it might be possible to make something gluten free for someone with celiac, and they said that would be okay. However, I was surprised and impressed that when I arrived, they even had gluten free bread for me! The waitress was also very well-informed about the menu, even knowing that certain things like their polenta had been cross contaminated with wheat. Overall, I was very impressed by their care taken for a celiac diner, even though they do not advertise as being gluten free friendly specifically. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed in the taste of the Bouillabaisse I ordered. However, the service was so good that I would be happy to come back and try a different dish sometime."
4,Sehr coole Location !!
0,"Confirmed yelp reservation was not accepted upon arrival.  Staff ""tried to call"", apparently absolving them from their commitment.  Argumentative rather than apologetic.  Not okay."
4,Excellent omelette with ham and cheese. Very helpful translating to English. Cozy atmosphere.
3,"The cheapest vegetarian place ever. You can eat and drink like a king for 8 euros. The food is top quality, the staff is a dream team of nice ladies and it's near Sankt Pauli and Schanze. After three days of hangover and greasy cooking it feels good to have some nature in your plate."
4,"Wow this was the best Chocolate Factory tour/experience ever !!!You learn all about chocolate where it comes from, to how it is grown and then the whole process to how it becomes to being a chocolate bar with many tastings along the way.  This is the first tour that I have ever been on that involved so much tasting from start to finish and making your own bar.  At the beginning 5 lucky people can try the beans (that are covered in the white slimy flesh) that come from the big fresh coco pods (first time ever seen a real fresh one not a model version).  I was one of the lucky ones and it tasted a bit like a lychee / melon.  Don't miss out. We then went along and tasted the beans after being roasted, we then made a bar with a choice of approx 10 ingredients to sprinkle all over our bar from gummy bears to nuts, then we watched the machines that made the chocolates from the melting process to the wrapping of the bars. You can even weigh yourself to see how many chocolate bars you would equal to I was around 640 bars. At the end you then get your bar back from the fridge and wrap it up and the chocolate by the way is gorgeous a bit like Lindt.  I highly recommend to any chocolate lover.  The only thing that lets this factory down is that there is only one tour during the day that is in English and that is done at 12:30 so if you want to go along to this place and you can only speak English then don't miss that tour at that time."
0,"Frechheit! I ordered a Deli Burger from the lunchtime menu and wow, what an absolutely disappointing, overpriced lunch!At €11.50, I was stupid enough to assume that something above average would arrive at our table - how wrong could I be??The burger arrived and only filled a quarter of the plate. Not even the tiniest garnish was served with this 'meal'. The burger itself was nothing special at all and so covered in coleslaw, it was very hard to decide if the burger was handmade, bought or frozen.I expected way more from a restaurant owned by a famous German chef. Go to McDonald's just up the street if you want something bigger and better value for money. What an absolute rip off!!!"
4,"Those pancakes doe, for everyone who has been to Pancake-countries such as Canada or the US and then is craving for real thick yummy pancakes, needs to go to Mamalicious! This is the No. 1 spot for pancakes in Hamburg. I will never forget that day when I went to Mamalicious for the first time and a lady passed by and took pics of our food because it looked so incredibly gooood!"
4,Lovely place for coffee or sandwich. Unpretentios and affordable inspite of location. Big enough to accomodate large groups. Wonderful service. First floor terrace overlooking Binenalster channel makes it even more attractive. What else to wish?
3,"A really nice place for Sunday brunch in Hamburg.Considering its position just a stone's throw from the Rathausmarkt and Neuer Wall, it could easily use the same tactic as nearby places such as Alex at the Alsterpavillon or Mio on Jungfernstieg where the sheer number of tourists mean that they can ramp up prices and largely ignore good service.However at Melange this doesn't seem to be the case. For the equivalent of EUR10 per person for a hungry family of four we enjoyed a large range of breads, tea, hot chocolate, meats, cheeses, scrambled egg, croissants, Schwartzbrot, a glass of prosecco. Delicious!So you can sit in one of four places; either outside alongside the water (ask for blankets if you are cold), inside on the ground floor, but recommended especially on a cold day is the inside upper floor where there is a nice buzz and friendly crowd of tourists and locals plus it has a smaller outdoor balcony too. It's actually open from 9am on Sundays (earlier than many places) and from 10.30 gets really busy so expect a slight wait after this time.On the whole the staff are friendly and efficient, speak English and were very kind to our children."
2,"Ok. We came here mainly because both me and my wife's most favorite comic book character of all time is Batman. Yes, I know it is a city in Turkey, but we still had to try the doner kebab here because of the name...if not for all of the glowing reviews as well. If anything, the food here is a fantastic deal. It's seriously lunch and dinner for about €4. Many places only offer doner kebab stuffed in pita, but here they are well known for the durum doner which are served with delicious freshly made flatbread (it's really good!).The meat, however, we both felt was lacking in flavor and that is a pretty big component in the doner kebab itself. I know we will be back, but only after we've sampled around some."
4,"Delicious! This place was small, but with a great personality.  The food was great and they gave my boyfriend and I huge portions.  I had the lox bagel with eggs and he had a fried mix fish platter.  The menu was in German and so we just used Google translate.  The staff was nice, attentive, and spoke some English.  No wifi."
2,"As expected, your typical Hofbrau house with the traditional hall seating setup! Traditional food as well with 1L beers at reasonable (but slightly pricier) prices. Recommend stopping by for the experience! Can also make reservations. They sell the steins and mugs as well."
4,"When I moved to HH from California, I thought that I would never find a bowl of guacamole, let alone a decent enchilada. Then I found Cafe Mexico. This is the real deal. The family who runs this charming cafe come from Mexico City, and they cook The Best enchiladas in Hamburg. The mole (a rich dark sauce made with chocolate, spices and nuts) is heavenly. The chilaquiles are great too...come to think of it, EVERYTHING is tasty here. And the tequila selection....yummmmmmmm. The decor is right out of Mexico, with the Virgin of Guadalupe and lots of cacti watching over the diners. Love it! And the service is just as it is in Mexico--mellow and friendly. Prices are quite reasonable. Cafe Mexico is a bright spot of sunshine. When friends say that they've never eaten Mexican food (or they think Mexican is just fajitas or Tex-Mex), we bring them here. I would eat here once a week if I lived closer to the Schanze!"
2,"This was a tough star rating, because there are definitely things I really enjoy about CIU but things I am so so indifferent to as well. I wanted to give it more a 3.5 star rating but (don't laugh!) I can not figure out yet how to scroll to a half star.  Maybe it is something special for ""professional Yelper"" to access, but right now I am earning my wings by rating my favorite things :)Ok, so what do I like about CIU? The atmosphere, the pretty looking bar arrangement, the music, and coming with a friend or friends in a group for cocktails to get yourself prepared to go clubbing/dancing somewhere later if you come on the weekend. If you come during the week, its nice to grab a high table behind the bar, order some world class drinks with fruits hanging all over the place that practically overwhelm the glass itself, and enjoy music with a friend and feel like you kinda went out, but without really doing it up too crazy. What is just okay about the place? Location, it is a bit of a walk unless you are driving by car or dropped off by taxi.  If you are wearing flat shoes, it is no problem at all, but if you are wearing heels and getting off at Jungfernstieg, then its a bit of a ""spazieren gehen"" lovely scenic walk as they might say in Germany.  At least you can walk up Ballindamm next to the lake, I mean the Alster just makes everything THAT much BETTER :)  The food is also just ""okay"" and they stop serving kinda early, considering most people like to drink and eat a bit later here, since it is busier between 7pm and 10pm, so if you try to come late to beat the cocktail rush, you also miss the opportunity to eat.The menu mainly consists of pizzas, salads, pastas and some general appetizers. The drinks really is the real reason most people come here and the music as they have a live DJ that spins good tracks.  For girls and even guys who are not shy to drink a cocktail with an elaborate fruit arrangement sprouting out of the glass, their specialty drinks here are nice to try and taste like an alcoholic dessert more or less. I sometimes am in the mood to enjoy a good martini, but I tried to order it here once and I was not crazy about it.  Martinis are not made equally in Europe vs. the US.  And funnily enough, James Bond was in international man of mystery who loved Martinis, so I wonder where he ordered his????"
4,"Don't really understand the bad reviews, cause I  really liked this bar! They play really good music and have an underground disco section. If you don't want wait behind the crowd to get your drinks by the main bar, you can go underground to get your drinks there as it was way less busy.Prices are decent and staff is friendly.  If I visited Hamburg again I'd probably return!"
3,A bit of Berlin hipster style but I like it a lot. It's a good choice for brunch or a small lunch if you follow a vegetarian diet. Delicious coffee and what's more attractive is their awesome homemade cookies!
4,"So we wanted to check this museum out so badly because we had read so many good reviews and heard great things about their collections.  And then vacation happened and we almost ran out of time to see it at all.  But...we had to at least go see the special Dali exhibit that they currently have there.  So glad we did!  If you are a Dali fan, you will love this one.  I wish I could say I saw lots more of their permanent collection but I didn't.  We had to browse through in about an hour and that is nowhere near enough time to see it all.  We knew we were going to miss loads so we mapped out the major pieces/exhibits that we wanted to see the most.  If I make it back to Hamburg I will have to go here first thing and give it a proper tour.  They have a really lovely building and have built an amazing collection."
4,Can't really say enough about this place. Locally sourced carvery meat and home made potatoes and knodel. Very simple concept and reasonably priced. Very impressed with the quality and the service. A short walk from Messberg station.
3,"A pretty cool place near the Schanze. Your typical bar/lounge concept with some interesting design concepts. Without going into details others have already written about, notable is that the crowd tends to be in their twenties (college kids), half the people stand out front so they can smoke and the bartenders tend to be quite nice (rare in Hamburg bars). The chick with half her breasts tattooed is totally cool and the Asian guy is always helpful. There's also a small room downstairs which I found a bit claustrophobic.this is totally skip-able. Definitely worth checking out though as it's one of the morein places when it comes to the Schanze."
3,"It seemed only fitting, being Australian and all, to go to the 'Down Under' bar to watch Deutschland Vs Australia in the Football. I must admit, I was a little scared. I was anticipating a horribly tacky, over-done museum of typical Aussie icons plastered on the walls with a sound track of Steve Urwin saying ""Crikey"" over and over in the background. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that although there were typical Aussie icons present like digeridoos and kangaroo signs, it didn't feel over done. It didn't feel like 'home' but it felt good. I think the menu was comical rather than accurate...I don't actually think in reality there are too many typical Australian dishes. But they did a great job to have kangaroo on the menu. Please eat them- they are a pest! I had a chicken burger that came in a baguette. Once again, I don't know how Australian that is but who cares? It tasted good! We had friendly service from the bar staff and waitresses which IS typically Australian and to me, more important. It was a great atmosphere to watch the game in. Australians and Germans together got to witness the thrashing. All in all, a great night."
3,"I don't know how I missed this place during the first 6 weeks I lived in Hamburg only a short walk away!Came here for lunch with coworkers. I ordered the Gyrosteller mit Mextaca sahnesoße, tzatski und pommes. Very good, large portions, great lunch spot. The lunch menu comes with a small salad, main dish and a small desert. In this case, dessert was a cinnamon rice pudding with brown sugar.Very reasonably priced at only €6,90 per person.The staff was friendly and helpful. Our meal came out quick and they checked on us during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed and to ensure that it met our expectations."
4,"Fabulous!! FIRST: make a reservation! SECOND: eat the entire pizza. We had a party of six with a reservation and were seated within minutes and served some of the best food of our lives. Do t miss this place!! Fun, loud and cramped in all the best ways."
2,"My wife and I are still on the hunt for the more American-style Chinese food (e.g. bucket of chicken fried rice), and this place is not that.Dinner was good, but fairly nondescript. I got the chicken fried rice, but there were less than half a dozen small pieces of chicken in the entire thing and on the whole it was rather bland. The fried wontons were good, but the meat-to-dough ratio was a little disappointing. She got a chicken noodle dish that she was relatively happy with, but once again, nothing outstanding.We'll probably be back because it's relatively close, but the hunt for my default take-out place continues."
3,"their cheesecake is really great.the way steaks are cooked, also excellent. the medium-rare was juicy and soft.only thing I missed was kid's menu."
3,Great place for German food close to everything in Hamburg.  We had two people get the pork shank for dinner and it was excellent (a little fatty). The beer was good and the prices were good. Great value for the money. I would definitely recommend if you are spending any time in Hamburg.
3,"I love their lunch meals. I go from time to time with my work colleagues and we enjoy the meals there. Normally I order a meal which consists of fried mixed vegetables, rice and kebab meat. The value for the price is great."
3,"L'osteria is a nice and stylish restaurant opposite of the opera. The pizzas are pretty big and very tasty. The pasta dish was ok. The staff was nice but forgot some drinks and we had to wait pretty long for the drinks. A nice feature was an Italian audio played in the restroom, which taught how to make a restaurant reservation in Italian.The entrance was even with the ground."
4,"The perfect place to have an original Indian meal. It takes you to the middle of India!Der beste Ort, an dem man ein kleines Stück Indiens erleben kann! Wirklich indisch!"
3,"The tour is interesting but only moderately though for young children. The tastig of chocolate you get to do is kept to a minimum but you get to make one bar of chocolate which you can decorate, lots of fun, BUT only for a full priced ticket, not for a child ticket which is totally NOT COOL!"
0,So you want wine and tapas? Well forget it - your not welcome there if you have that wish. The owner is surprisingly unfriendly and rude and only wants 'real' dinner guests in his tapas hole.
3,"IMHO so far the best Portugese Restaurants in Hamburg I have tried! The only drawback is that it is way too crowded and therefore the waiters tend to be stressed out. Make a reservation! The food is definitely worth it! Nice ambiance too! Don't spread the word, its toocrowded already ;-) Ok others are obviously not on the same page with me here, but try the Cataplanas (copper bowlswith simmered seafood) You didn' t like it here? Good. More space for the rest of us."
2,"It seems as if most major cities have a Hofbrahaus, and it's not a bad choice in my opinion since the food and beer are at least decent. I'm not German, so I can't speak for the authenticity of the cuisine. I can, however, speak for my satisfaction.The English menu is pared down compared to the German menu, so look back and forth between the two to get a full understanding of the selection - especially the beers. I ordered the pork shank. The skin was charred to a semi-darken crisp that enveloped the layers of succulent meat and gelatinous fat inside. Its entirety was sitting upon savory but slightly sour gravy. Served alongside were pickled root vegetables and a warm potato dumpling. While the food was appetizing, it was difficult to cut the pork without having the flakey skins fly everywhere. Fortunately I was wearing my throw-away clothes, so I didn't mind spilling gravy and pulling oily flakes of pork skin off my shirt. Note that the portions are HUGE! I could only finish half my plate. If dining with friends, I would suggest splitting the dishes. Because I came in during the afternoon on a day that was between Christmas and New Years, it was relatively empty. I am sure this place gets packed and rowdy during football matches since they have large television screens broadcasting games. The interior consists primarily of large picnic bench seating - ideal for groups of 6 or more. There are some two-person table sets, but I wouldn't go here to have an intimidate date or conversation.Overall, I would recommend this place if you would like good food and beer over a casual conversation with a group of friends (think ""happy hour"" and work event type of space)"
3,"I go here quite a lot as its just down the road, does very nice food but most importantly we get a great welcome.There are probably hundreds of Italian restaurants in Hamburg, but this is the place where we take Qype staffers visiting the city for the first time.It usually has a table, and the prices are pretty keen as well."
4,"This museum was very fun. It smells very nice inside, although the spices out on display to smell have pretty much lost most of their smell / blended together with other spices. There were four samples that you could try (roasted chickpeas, sugared chickpeas, and two other sweet things). It was pretty cool walking around and seeing all the different spices."
2,"Firstly the most negative points I have about Balutschistan are not entirely their own fault. We took too many people, which rendered the sit-on-floor room very uncomfortable. This combined with the room being very dark led to me chipping my tooth (which I'm pretty pissed off about). Also with the room being so crowded (see photo) the waiters couldn't get in and the people in the middle of the room were only half tuned-in for passing things along. Yeah, it wasn't the greatest experience. Food-wise though the place was pretty good. I ordered a ""please make it more spicey"" lamb rogan josh and it came nicely spiced. The beers were decent and the service reasonably prompt, especially given that there were 20 odd of us. One downside is that the food is quite pricey by Hamburg standards. A curry and two beers came to EUR17"
3,"This place is crazy. So many details and special effects. If you like trains, building stuff, or if you have a kid this is the place. It was a little to crowded for me. Many kids and parents. They have minimiced citys over the world and they make it possible for you to see theese in daylight but also at night. This place is big so make sure you have time to go trough all rooms. They serve food and theres toilets. Costs 16 euro per person in entrence fee for adults. There are parkingspots near and a parking house."
3,"I was near the Alster Lake on a nice Sunday afternoon and wasn't sure where to go for lunch. I found Jim Block to be right near the lake, and there was a huge crowd. I went in, and ordered my burger  meal combo which comes with a drink and fries. I must say, the burger here was simply amazing. I also took their original Mayo, which was so thick and creamy. The fries, the mayo and the burger was the perfect combo for a nice Sunday afternoon meal. They have seating both indoors and outdoors. I'd suggest sitting outdoors. The ambience is nice for a good meal.The staff are also courteous."
3,"Superb establishment. Everything everyone has said is true, I realised as much after my own personal cocktail consultation on massage Mondays! What do you like? What tastes, what spirits, what mood are you in? What's your favourite colour? What's your name, where'd you come from, how many. no wait. I got recommended a Hendrick's crush, which contains crushed kumqats! What an invention, a fruit that no one had any use for before, apart from ornamental, of course. Anyway, it was delicious. I've since been back and sampled the flammkuchen (also great) and watched the fish a lot. An impressive tank. On Monday nights every customer gets a free massage too - slightly surreal, but great!"
4,"The price is a little high and the place a little ""cold"" fancy. but the meat is fantastic."
4,"Fantastic food, friendly staff who always remember a face, and reasonable prices (mid-range but for good portion sizes)! Bin begeistert!!"
4,"It is a hidden gem. One of the best restaurant in Hamburg. Very high quality food with a creative touch, yet affordable. Prepair to wait for at least 30 min. to get a table."
4,"First time trying pakistan's food and i felt in love directly. The food to my sense is like indian's food, full of spicy but soooo delicious. The best thing is that there is a place where we can sit directly there, no need a chair. So cozy so relax, makes us almost felt to sleep :DThe food like i said total delicious, especially very recommended the mango lassi. That is like tasting heaven's drink, until after that we seemed hypnotized with the taste left behind on our mouth,"
4,"My favorite bar in my favorite street of Hamburg, as they fit perfectly together. Both a mix of trashy & classy combined with a laid-back atmosphere and timeless interior. I really like the old gymnastics furniture, now function as sofas to sit down on..The big icebear in the corner is a pretty funny item too, as it doesnt fit into the context at all.. The coffee is delicious, already addicted to their caffee latte machiato. You can smell the homemade pastas at every corner of this cosy bar, which makes you crave for one..even when you not hungry. You order at the bar, which can be annoying when it gets crowded in the weekends, but it does create a peaceful moment when you dont have stressed staff coming up to your table asking you what else you would like...Yes, that may sound strange..but I experienced it in that sort of a way..Just do your own thing. The background music is divers but always good varying from electronic sounds in the weekends and funky jazz/lounge during the week. And if you dont feel like talking...there are tons of magazines to update your knowlegde about anything youd like..5 stars cause its a great picture all together!"
3,"Good place for a quick stop for some seafood. Fresh fish, nice staff, authentic place, and good prices. What else can you ask for?"
2,"Kleiner Coffee Shop nahe der UBahn Hallerstraße mit wenigen Sitzplätzen, aber süße Inneneinrichtung. Die Preise sind ok (z.B. Caffe Latte Medium 3,20€).  Die Bedienung war etwas wortkarg, aber alles in allem kann man auf einen Coffee-to-go vorbeischauen wenn man in der Gegend ist."
3,"Good burger, nice restaurant, self-service, price low"
4,This is definetely my favorite place for coffee. It's tiny so sometimes I have to do take away but coffee is first class. Usually when I drink coffee I have this funny problem after where I feel quite tired after few hours. With Peaberries coffee I never felt anything like that. My wife told me this has to something with a way how coffee is roasted.
1,Service is good after a little waiting time you get seated! Burgers don't take long. Ordered a rare farmers burger but got a burger grilled well done. After asking if that's the rare burger they just said sorry this happens when it's busy. That's it...Beer is alright. Sides are good.
4,Most amazing place! Great personale and service from the get go! Food soooo delicious -nothing less! Go people! Go!!! Remember only German credit card or cash!Denmark
4,"Beautiful old building, interesting guided tour (with appropriate length). A must see when in Hamburg."
4,By far the best Kebab I ever had. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. So is the service. The ideal place to spent afternoons with a good book and you diary. They also serve an excellent coffee.
2,"The sitting-on-the-floor option is a novelty thing and fun - for the first five minutes. afterwards you get a bit cramped. there's hardly any space and if you go with more than 4 people, conversation tends to get lost in curry fumes. Yet my friends never seem to get tired of it and always drag me into this place.The food is ok. Even though the menu offers plenty of dishes they tend to taste similar. Some of the dishes are served quite cold so ask if you're unsure. Also stay away from the lassis unless you like sweets with your main course.the service is a bit grumpy and not very talkative. still, it's ok+ food at an ok price at a great location!"
3,"We stumbled upon this place on a Sunday during a recent trip to Hamburg.   It appears to be family owned and a very friendly restaurant as well.   We had several interesting dishes fresh fish, potatoes soup and my daughter's favorite a sort of perogi casserole.   We have had to recreate this and it has become a family favorite.   Nice view on the canal too."
2,"I like RehBar, the grown up more austere big brother of Aurel. Decent prices and it has a nice ambience but the place is a bit soulless. I like working there as there is free WiFi. Nice but nothing special."
3,"Now, this is my kind of coffee bar. Stylish, modern but rustic-chic comfortable and clean. Fairly friendly service, accommodating to our group of 10 (reservation made prior) and quick with the breakfast, coffee and teas. My muesli with yogurt and fresh fruit hit the spot, as did my THREE cappuccinos. I had to restrain myself from eating the potted cheesecake for breakfast, but I so wanted to. The paninis also seem to be a very solid choice. The two larger communal tables are VERY sturdy. In fact a bit hard to get in and out of (as Aaron S mentions), but hey...they surely don't wobble or go uneven! A very nice spot to sit and chat. To read. To enjoy a light lunch or breakfast. Read the paper. Soak in a quick break before you tackle Hamburg. I will definitely return on my next visit. *cash only. There is a cash machine just outside to the right across the street. You'll be able to see it from the front door!"
2,"We liked this place although I can understand how some people may have things to complain about. I found the interior as well as outdoor seating very inviting and service was competent yet somewhat slow. The woman, whom I believe owns this place, tends to stay inside. She seems to be the most service oriented but usually doesn't do waitressing to tables. Anyway, we come here for the cakes and quite enjoy them. The selection may be somewhat limited but they always seems to have something we enjoy. I especially like their assortment of coffees and usually get a ""Grosser Brauner"" which is my favorite. Food here is kind of hit or miss outside of breakfast. You can pretty much depend on their breakfast offering. I'd recommend simply checking it out for yourself. Do remember that if you are sitting outside and it's sunny or a lot of people are out and about in the Hafencity, it tends to get kind of loud."
2,"Jimmy Elsass is supposedly the number one location to satisfy one's Tarte Flambée cravings in Hamburg. After having heard of this almost legendary venue for years I finally got around to actually visiting it - and was just a wee bit underwhelmed. The interior is decorated in typical students pub style (which is supposed to be no distinct style at all) - lime green walls, old fashioned seats, dim lighting and oversized plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling (and hence obstructing the way for taller guests). Some might find it charming and genuine, I however wouldn't mind a bit more polish here and there, especially as prices aren't exactly cheap. And this leads me to my main criticism: Tarte Flambée is an exceptionally cheap dish to produce, which is why I find a price range starting from six Euros a bit overconfident. That isn't to say the actual taste wasn't good, because it was - the base was crispy and light, though it could have done with more generous topping (and maybe more hearty bacon). But I generally don't like it when a restaurant's profit margins are as obvious as is the case at Jimmy Elsass'. The dessert menu also offers a sweet Tarte Flambée with apple and almonds ""flambé-ed"" with Calvados. It sounded intriguing, but actually wasn't all that nice, as the alcohol's taste was a bit too dominant and made the Tarte's base very soggy indeed. I'd avoid it in the future. Which isn't something I'd say of Jimmy Elsass in general - the place's got a focused menu with decent, if overpriced offerings. I just won't go out of my way to get there in the future and will definitely try the competition, as well."
1,"Ok pasta/ pizza to a ok price and friendly staff. That's what you get, if you get in. Usually long que and even if you book a table you have to wait an hour or more to get in."
4,"I absolutely love and recommend the location for a 'half-decadent' Friday lunch. Food is modern Vietnamese cuisine, the serving process is optimized and even when you see a long queue you will still be seated and served within less than 10 minutes. The staff is extremely friendly. It can be noisy and crowded at times but that's part of the experience too."
3,"The Delta Bistro is really in quite an odd place! You'd be forgiven for thinking you were actually walking into a factory, because, well, you are! It's on the first floor of some sort of cash and carry which is part of the meat market here. You'll be walking down a deserted street that's fairly badly lit with parked lorries stacked on the pavement, and getting a little bit lost before you find it. Upstairs, the seating is very spacious, and the service, although not fast, very professional. Both starter (carpaccio de boeuf), and main (rib-eye steak) were excellent, and the Austrian wine we ordered was very drinkable too. I would tell you how much it cost but my date for the evening paid for everything too, what a bonus!"
2,"Quite expensive, waiters try to sell you most expensive food without prices. Nice atmosphere and chic. I would go there again, but oder less food."
4,"A great new Irish pub in Deichstrasse. A great selection of beer and whiskey as the name would suggest. Live music, karaoke and live sports on tv add to the atmosphere. Definitely a great place to meet up and only a short walk from Rodingsmarkt U-Bahn station. Richard and the team give you a warm welcome and I look forward to going back many times."
2,"I was here already few times and every time I ate Sushi. This time I tried out Ramen, Ramen is a kind of Japanese noodles in soup. However, they said it's Korea noodles in soup in their Menu. Anyway I tried out. I was totally disappointed. It was like a kind of instant noodle then put some veggie and beef. The soup was no taste at all and the beef was very very tough.There are wide range of choices in their Menu.  I can say some restaurants try to increase their choice in their Menu but a lot of dishes are not up to standard.  I came across there are some restaurants are only selling one kind of food but there are long queue in front of their door. This restaurant made very good Sushi and why they don't concentrate on the food they are strong with ????In any case, I had reviewed my disappointment with the witness and they told me their boss is a Korean and not Japanese."
3,If you order the Bio-Wuchtbrumme mit Grillgold you will receive a piece of organic meat soaked in a reddish curry dip served with french fries. - Go for it!
3,"Nice local Greek place with decent food and big serving sizes. The staff is very attentive and nice, although very loud in conversations. It's pretty dark inside, but there are also some tables outdoor. The menu is quite diverse and most of the food options are meat. Not five stars yet, but definitely recommendable."
0,Pretty poor experience with Kofookoo. Booked a table for a Saturday night way in advance through Yelp reservations. Table for 4 wasn't available on arrival. Restaurant claimed Yelp reservations do not match technically with their reservations system. Since the place was packed they couldn't offer a place at the bar or table in a appropriate time span. Disappointing.
3,"Small and cozy place with a lot of great food. We went there for late breakfast. The pancake with blueberries are amazing. The homefries they serve are also amazing. And everything there is vegetarian, most things even vegan. The vegan bacon was really good."
1,"Tried their cheeseburger last night. The meat tasted odd and was too finely grained, rather like sausage meat.Service was friendly, although there was a lack of attention to detail."
2,"YES VAPIANO IS POPULARYES VAPIANO IS FRESHBut it's overrated. I wouldn't consider this as a restaurant. It's a upscale fastfood chain since you get a card at the entrance to pay your ordered food with. It's a marketing strategy since you pay with a plastic card and not with real money, you lose the awareness of the value.And at the canteen you'll take a tray and after 15 min of waiiting in line hopefully you got your meal.This is not bad at all. I like it crowdy and waiting for someone to free their table so we can sit. No seriously I think it's fun :DThe only thing why I gave it 3 stars is because I'm always still hungry when I leave Vapiano. The dish you order comes with a huge bowl or plate or whatever but the actual food covers only 1/3 of it. And I refuse to order another one.  THAT'S THE CATCH. People order more because one dish is too little.I REFUSE bitches!"
2,"Pizza okay, Service langsam. Für einen Haps zwischendurch geeignet!"
4,Awesome! Wonderful food and Benny was a great server to us. So hospitable and down to earth Would come back here often.
1,"We went here to get a nice lunch and it was quite of a disappointment.The pizza crust was definitely made from factory and the topping didn't taste fresh. We also got a oven baked potato with sallad and chicken and it was barely warm. I bet this is a great place to get drinks, based on other reviews, but DO NOT com here for the food - you'll regret it!"
2,"Indifferent staff, very contrived atmosphere, limited choice of drinks, not a fan really."
3,"Burgerlich is a Burger Restaurant close to Rathaus. When you enter the Restaurant you get a card, which you need to order your food. Within the tables there are tablet which you have to use to order your food. Be aware that you order everything seperately. The food is the served at the table. Before you leave the restaurant you pay at the exit."
3,Always busy at lunch time and sometimes a bit to crowded. Although the food really tastes good... Love the pickled garlic chilis for seasoning. Unfortunately it sometimes takes a bit to get served and some of the serving staff is grumpy.
3,"Thursdays and Saturdays, children get free food!Very friendly service.I like their grilled chicken."
4,"Classy, great seafood. Really good restaurant serving some fish specialities from Hamburg."
3,"I highly recommend this place, it's a lot cooler and more local than all the touristy spots on the reeperbahn, and it's a bit of an older and more hip crowd (mostly people 30s and above, but I'm not even 20 and didn't feel weird at all). We were the only non-Germans it seemed like. It took us a while to get our cocktails, and they weren't exactly cheep, but it was well worth it because they were AMZING. Best cocktails I've ever had, and shots are pretty well priced! The interior of the bar is super funky, the bartenders are fun, beautiful, and amazing, and all the people here were so friendly. All in all this place has a great vibe and we had a really fun Saturday night!"
3,"La Sepia is located at the Sternschanze stop in Hamburg, which is filled with a bunch of hipster restaurants and boutiques. I liked the location cause La Sepia is right next to the Schanze's Sofa Bar (Zöe), so I can easily just walk on over after dinner to relax on a nice vintage sofa and enjoy some late night drinks. I had dinner on the night of a World Cup game so everyone was outside and all the restaurants were showing the game. It was really an event to see.The complimentary garlic dip at the beginning was okay, and a little bit on the saltier side, but when you're hungry and waiting on your food it doesn't necessarily matter. My boyfriend and I had the White Hauswein with our dinner. They brought our a bottle of it, and payment was calculated based on how much we actually drank, which I found to be liberating. I had the Paella Meeresfrüchte, which I definitely could've shared. The main problem with La Sepia is the wait and service. We waited for our food for over an hour and every time we asked about it, the server said he would go check on it and let us know, but he never came back. This happened about 3 times in one sitting. They would avoid us and it was just ridiculous. My boyfriend, who is a local, said that that was the norm of La Sepia. Make sure your BS tolerance is high the night you visit La Sepia. Otherwise, I would just come eat during lunch time to avoid the crowd."
4,"This place has great coffee! The food was fresh and quick and very reasonably priced. The staff were friendly and efficient. Plus, they allow dogs!"
1,"If you speak English or not that much German and have any needs that you want to communicate, this might not be the place. The staff did not understand what we asked for when saying ""keine Milch"", which should be pretty self explanatory.. They also forgot to give us our drinks. Food (when we finally managed to make an order) was good, though."
3,Good: Strong modern vietnamese dishes. Tasty and unique.Not so good: Portions ran on the medium-smaller side. We just had to order more.
4,"I was pleasantly surprised today when I was brought in by my Qype colleagues to this asian looking little gem called the Loving Hut. Me and my 2 words of German were glad to see we were going into familiar grounds: an English name, surely an English menu, right? Yes! I ordered the Curry which was pretty nice which came with either soup or spring rolls as appetizers for a mere EUR7. I'm not vegan in any way although I like the concept. In fact I could consider myself a 'vegan-virgin' before today (I really do love my beef burgers) but the dish was really tasty, definitely filling and left me wanting to try a new one sometime soon. Judging by one of the Qypers below, we got the best spot in da' place too!! The one and only round table in the back!"
4,"FANTASTIC! Loved it! My husband and I went there for lunch about 2 weeks ago and we were both very pleased with our pizzas. I was able to get a vegan pizza, he was able to get a meat pizza. Both of us gobbled up the whole thing."
3,Great food and service. Not so great when it comes to location. But we go to restaurants for the food and not the location ;)
4,"Headed to luigis after a long day after hearing some really great things about it and i was not disappointed! Me and my dad had a pizza and pasta to share and both were really great. Although there was a little queue to get a seat, it moved really quickly and the wait was definitely worth it. Very reasonably priced pizzas and pastas, and great drinks as well! Definitely will come back!!!"
2,"Tiefenthal is a café that's trying to be a restaurant as well as a bar at once. It's most successful at being an upper class café (and rallying point for yummy mommies and the like) and acceptable for a drink, but I'd avoid the more complex restaurant offerings. There's a simple rule: Tiefenthal is good at simple things - salads, roastbeef and sandwiches. Unfortunately though the chef struggles with anything more fancy; the more expensive, the worse, at least as far as I can speak from my own experiences. The Wiener Schnitzel, for example, is a disgrace and not even cheap. There are about a dozen places I know in Hamburg where you can get a much better quality Schnitzel for the same money (Casse-Croute near Gänsemarkt, for example). Another problem is the service. On a busy, sunny afternoon it can take ages before you get your homemade ice tea (which is wonderful, by the way). Most waiters/waitresses are professional at their job, but on occasion I've had to deal with one particular waitress whose attitude is rather bold (bordering on impertinent). All things considered I wouldn't mind visiting the place every once in a while, as long it's not for proper lunch/dinner. But then again, if you're allergic to the Eppendorf hoi polloi, you should avoid the Tiefenthal at any cost."
4,bestice creamevertry snickers!! It was incredible and I would go there any time. Little expensive but totally worth it
0,"been to this place too many times (10 times at least). Everything is perfect until tonight when I paid for a drink at the bar and then didn't get anything after 5 mins. I asked the waitress that I paid for my drink but she pretended that I didn't pay her! She is a blondish girl (not a real blond) in the corner of the bar when you get in. SHE IS A LIAR! be careful of bartenders there! I mean this girl is cheaper than a prostitue she claimed I didn't pay her for a beer that costed 3.5€, come on even a prostitute is worth more! poor girl ..."
4,"Delicious German food our beautifully rustic atmosphere. We had the Rinderroulade and Pannfisch, which both were delicious.The staff is super friendly and helpful. Added with a bit of luck you also get to meet the house's dog."
3,"Got here about 30 minutes before they closed for the afternoon on a friday! The place was not packed at all and the wait staff were happy to sit us. There is a reasonable lunch special for about 5 euros which I recommend and which my friend and I ordered from. I did notice that they had a dim sum menu. I love dim sum so I will be back for sure to try that next time!For this lunch adventure though, we ordered from the lunch Specials menu. I ordered the curry fish and my friend ordered the si chuan eggplant. We started with hot and sour soup which is included in the lunch special. The soup was really good, I added a couple dashes of white pepper to enhance the flavors but it was still really good without it. Then the main dishes were presented to us in a sharing style. With both orders in the middle of the table and a side of rice for both of us to share. I really enjoyed both dishes! The fish curry is the normal yellow curry and had bits of carrots and onions in it. The fish was very tender and curry was very flavorful esp. over the rice. Yum! I tried some of the eggplant and it wasn't too spicy but it as also really flavorful. My friend and I happily cleaned our plates! Overall, its a solid choice for chinese food. The lunch special is reasonably priced. The portion size of the lunch specials are perfect for lunch as well, not too much but just enough to fill you up!I will definitely be back for dim sum :)"
4,Absolutely awesome!  We'll worth a reason to visit Hamburg alone!  We took backstage tour offered for some extra euros. We were lucky to have taken the tour since we were only two. Great insight of the technology used.
4,"Found my coffee joint in Hamburg!! Tons of space. Great light hip vibes. Amazing coffee at amazing prices. Whether it's to meditate on your beans, get work done, or meet up for a chat, this is the joint. They source from Five Elephant and some other roasters! This place is the real deal! Hit this place up. Foreigners are welcome hahahaha.. I think? Friendly staff and people."
2,"The Parlament is hidden in the Rathaus basement?; the reason why I probably have never seen it before.Inside the interior is really majestic and richly ornated. The crowd is a bit older, up against 40.The atmosphere is quite formal, but fits fine with the venue. The food seems to be expensive, but I havent tried it yet. Nice to take your parents, or just enjoy a typically businesslike/historical spot in Hamburg. Tourist or not."
2,An OK version of an Aussie bar where you can drink VB and Fosters. The food is quite good: wings are the house speciality in many many sauces  not typically Australian but good. A bit out of town but walkable from Dammtor station.
4,"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday...delicious eggs with Krabben (little shrimp from the North Sea), good croissants and brötchen, top notch butter and marmalade, good coffee, excellent service. Sweet little place with tables outside, but not too many."
2,"This coffee shop has been hyped as one of the best places in Hamburg for a coffee. For me personally, to test the coffee quality in an outlet specializing in coffee the gold standard is to order an Espresso. What shall I say? Their Espresso is a far cry from a decent Espresso... it looks like a bland blackish puddle produced by a fully automated machine and tastes also like it. No crema, very watery. The only plus is a very fruity and light taste to the coffee, reminding me of a spring flower bouquet. So, coffee quality fairly ok, preparation a no-go. Service is definitely not this spot's strength with both counter attendants minding their own business with an air of utter indifference toward the customer. Maybe this experience is a one-off and I would see a very different atmosphere some other time around. Yet, there won't be another time."
4,"An amazingly beautiful building from inside and out. Make sure to do the tour of the inside, it is well worth it and only cost 4 Euros! You get a bit of history and get to see the amazing rooms. Everything is original which makes the building special in Hamburg. It survived both world wars almost completely (besides for the windows) intact."
4,"Nice little spot in a beautiful old Hamburg neighborhood. Part ""Cheers,"" part New York neighborhood bistro. German staples and a few goodies like eggs and potatoes.They don't open until Noon (2p on Sunday). Perfect for brunching after a night on the Reeperbahn!FYI, they are very protective of their larger tables when it's busy. If you are one or two, they won't seat you at a four-top. Yours truly is traveling solo this trip and got relegated to the tiny bar. No complaints, as that's my preference rather than being the lonely dude at a big table.  Also a good perch for people watching and composing pithy prose."
4,"Best Arabic restaurant in town. Cheap and super tasteful! The service is awesome as well, such nice and friendly waiters!"
4,"Awesome wine bar with small dishes to eat. Stumbled into this place with a friend who said he'd often walked by but never went in. From the outside it seems fairly generic and average. Once inside, it's a great, old style wine locale. Service is super nice, the lights are kept low, the mixed appetizer plate is extremely tasty and they have hundreds of wines by the bottle and almost as many by the glass. I will definitely be back here often."
3,"I was visiting the Miniature Wonderland and looked up restaurants that accept credit cards because a lot of the dining options around there only accept cash. I didn't convert my money as I was stopping in there for only a day. Figured you can use your card to pay at most dining establishments. Well, apparently not in Hamburg. When I tried to pay for my delicious crepe with a warm pear, I was told it was cash only. I offered to leave my card with them while I hunted down an ATM, but the obviously bothered waiter ran downstairs to get a POS machine and accepted my MasterCard. I tried to add a tip but was told they cannot add it to the card sale even though the print out indicated that option. Food and coffee were both amazing and they even offered me an English menu. I recommend this locale but be ready with local currency."
4,"This is the most beautiful and largest coffee shop I found in Hamburg. Excellent views of the canal. Huge space with plenty of areas to relax. Modern design. And of course....the coffee! Excellent. Third wave. They have Chemex, Aeropress, Syphon etc.... And free wifi."
4,"To be honest, despite thinking I was sober when I arrived at this bar, looking back I was not! But what I remember is that it was really nice atmosphere, wicked decor, good drinks prices and even though we planned to move on to another bar we did not so must have been good! I also have a vague memory of spinning some sort of music wheel on the dance floor and dancing on my own. So yes, I recommend it and will definitely be going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
3,Hands down Hamburg's currywurst beats Berlin's. The juicy sausage is packed with flavor and has the perfect snap as you bite into it.  Curry powder was flawless and not too overpowering - it was unforgettably mouthwatering and conveniently located in the most charming little city!
4,"This is one of the largest and most well maintained museums I've ever been to. Absolutely an essential part of your trip to Hamburg if you're even remotely interested in anything maritime related. This includes vikings, trade routes, slave trade, explorers, war ships, cargo shipping, harbour building, pirates, marine animals, fishing, treasures, ship wrecks and much more! The exhibitions stretch over nine stories with additional smaller exhibitions on various sub-floors in between. We didn't have enough time to visit every single room, but everything I saw was super well presented, interesting and dynamic.There are tours at various times in various areas as well as presentations throughout the different floors. We happened to walk in on a presentation of a container ship simulator that let you slowly, painstakingly experience what it's like to drive a large container ship along a canal leading to the harbour. It's slow. It's arduous. I thought it was incredibly boring (the simulator, not the presentation) but apparently people spend hours at home playing with these simulators. And enjoy it. For some reason.I loved the miniature ship exhibition. Thousands of miniature ships spanning several centuries of ship building and design. The piracy exhibit was also quite interesting, while the rooms on the slave trade (including a piece of an actual slave ship showing shakles and chains) and plague ships were quite harrowing though still really well presented.All the history of human activity on the seven seas seems to be brought together in this amazing building. The cafe downstairs is also reasonably priced for a museum cafe and very beautifully designed. We really enjoyed our trip to this museum."
3,"One of my favorite restaurants in Hamburg, and especially for fish! Great selection of fish (grilled or with a light sauce) for reasonable prices. Sides are pretty plain, but I've enjoyed the fish whenever I've been there (I haven't tried much else). Nice Spanish/Portuguese flair with cozy deco and atmosphere!! Service is usually a bit slow, but it's a nice place to go out for the evening."
4,"Your home away from home! No need to bring anything they've got it all here... your Kitchen, Laundry, Lounge, Dining, Bedroom (Including a comfy bed with duvet to snuggle up with.) and last but not least the games room at the back with a football table. Why have house parties in your own flat when you can use this place??No cleaning-up, the beers cheap and after a few drinks it really does feel like the place belongs to you and your mates. Brillent!"
2,"Came for a Sunday night dinner with a coworker. It's a nice, casual, pretty traditional German restaurant. I had the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and fries, which was pretty delicious. The kupfer (copper) beer was also delicious. Service was excellent, and all of the waiters spoke English, which is nice for a gringo like me. The main menu is in German and English; being downtown and in a business district, it seems like they get a lot of tourists/travelers. Entrees are in the 10-15 Euro range.I was bummed because I really wanted the Schweinehaxe (pork shank) with dumplings, but they were out. I ordered a different pork cutlet, but they were out of that, too. This was at 7 PM on a Sunday night, so not super-late, but I suspect they don't get deliveries over the weekend, so they were pretty much out."
3,"I thought this was a great choice for typical northern German dishes.  The dishes we ordered were well prepared, with good quality ingredients (especially the fish).  We tried  labskaus - it may be described in your guidebook as a kind of steak tartare, but this version seemed to be cooked with a bunch of interesting spices, then minced and/or pulverized into almost a paste.  Then it was topped with fried egg and served with beets and pickles.  Definitely uniquely Northern German (you won't find that in a Munich beer hall).   The other starter we ordered was a pea soup -- which was fantastically full of bacon.  For mains we had a flat-fish (like a flounder but I didn't catch the name), served smothered in small local shrimps, and a creamy fish stew, very nicely seasoned and served with potatoes that were absolutely perfectly cooked.  Service was very gracious too."
3,"I was walking around without my German friend so I had no translator. This place seemed fairly ""Americanized"" so I decided to go in in the hopes that someone here spoke English. I sat at the bar and luckily I was able to speak English to the bartender. He was nice by German standards haha. What I ordered: I got the veggie burger (Tina turner burger) and a beer. The burger was huge! And so tasty! The sauce was mayo-based (I think it was a currywurst sauce, but I'm not sure), but I enjoyed the flavor on this burger. The side was a small salad. Overall, it is not a standout place, but the quality of the food and service was good!"
1,"We tried seven different dim sum dishes but not only half of it was tasty and authentic. Some fried dumplings smelt already of (pork) fat when being served and didn't taste good either. Since we are regular in Hong Kong and Singapore, we know how it should taste. In addition, we were not amazed about the service either (actually fairly unfriendly, that's why I deduced another star).Nevertheless, we are 10.000km away from Hong Kong and authentic Chinese food is difficult to get: try the chicken feed at the Dim Sum house  they are really good and tasty!"
4,"It's a burger bar, not a 5 star restaurant, but we had a 5 star experience. It was recommend to us by our local bike tour leader as the best burger in Hamburg. We don't have any other hamburger experiences in Hamburg to compare, but we believe he didn't lie when he said that he's tested them all!It's busy so expect to wait for a table. We sat outside with a pitcher of beer. (For some unknown reason they wouldn't serve food outside.)We were seated in about 15 minutes.The burger choices are extensive. We had one farmhouse burger, one blue cheese burger and one vegetarian burger made from halloumi cheese. There were several vegetarian/vegan options, but I've never seen halloumi cheese offered as a burger, so I had to try it. It was great!The farmhouse burger was a great surprise. It was a tower of meat that could easily feed a family of 6. Not what we were expecting. I think something got lost in the German translation. It was impressive even though my husband can only eat a small portion of it. Each burger was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and the quality of meat was very good. For sides we had fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. The truffle Mayo For dipping was delicious.It was not a healthy dinner by any means. The piece of lettuce on the burger does not count as a serving of vegetable! But if you only want 1 burger in hamburger, this is an excellent choice."
4,"I am so happy finding this place through windy day of Hamburg. Despite of its small space and no chair, their food is super satisfying. That day, they only sold two choices of dishes: spaghetti (€7) and lasagna (€12). I ordered spaghetti topped with sorta white fish and tomato sauce. It came with big portion for my late lunch. The fish topping was generous and its sauce is pretty good, not too sour. You can choose some of beverages served. I ordered ingwer-minze-tee because I need hot beverage to reduce the windy effect to my body. I think I chose the right drink because it really boosted my mood. Thanks!!"
2,"All is said in Arril review. The surrounding is also great to walk with friends, play frisbee and enjoy movement of people and ships. I will always walk around when I have some time."
4,"Love this place!!! Amazing Turkish coffee and fantastic selection of Turkish sweets , baked goods and puddings. Yum!!"
3,I really liked this place. It was right around the corner from my hostel and right next to the Hbf. Interior is nice and gives a sailor-y vibe. Decent seafood selection which is what I was looking for. I got the fish soup and it absolutely hit the spot for lunch when I had a hangover. I tried the house beer which was a good darker beer as well. Would recommend for weary travelers looking for port food.
2,"I was unimpressed by this place. Had wanted to come here for a while as I had heard good things. Well, we finally reserved a table and tried it out. Nice location, ok ambiance and fairly nice staff. Yet, the food is totally mediocre. There is nothing special about it and even though the menu changes on a regular basis, we found it tough to find something we ""really"" wanted to order. Almost left because of this but had a go at it anyway. Oh well, we should of maybe left yet then I wouldn't of known how the food was.We won't be back but maybe it's just not our thing. It was really full and this on a Tuesday night. People do seem to like the place and in general it is good. Yet, if you're here for the food, I'd go elsewhere.Finally, I ordered a souffle for dessert. After coming out once and telling us it collapsed and there were going to try again, they brought out a failed attempt. After two tries, they couldn't get it right. Hence they brought one out which was all over the plate. It still tasted fine but to be honest, I would of simply said, ""hey, we can't get the souffle right tonight....have something else and it's on us!"" This alone would of had me come back to give them another chance. Yet, nope, they basically said we can't get it right so eat it this way....regardless of the poor presentation of the dish.I know this is nitpicking but it's why I go to restaurants and don't cook for myself at home. The ""show"" is part of the reason I am willing to pay higher prices. Oh well, we'll find something else I am sure."
4,"This really is an exceptional bar.  It is neighborhoody, unpretentious, but every aspect is just a step above.  The beer selection is fine (in an old-school, non-craft-beer-aficianado sense).  The outdoor seats let you settle back and reflect, and the indoor spots are pleasantly nooky.  The servers are keen, able, and cool.   A great place to hang."
4,"Great tapas. A good blend of Spanish & Moroccan styles and a good opportunity to try many dishes. I had a small lamb tagine as one dish and it was superb - maybe the best tagine I've ever had: so many great flavours. Very friendly staff in a stylish, modern restaurant."
3,"Excellent kebab house with innovative queuing system. You queue, order, pay and take a ticket - then find a seat and your food arrives in about 3 mins! I recommend the mix teller - wholesome plate of lots of stuff. I always get this as the menu choices are baffling. The battered fish looks interested but I've never had it thus far. Friendly staff and bargin basement prices. Worth a go."
0,"I won't recommend this place to anyone, who likes to eat authentic Indian food the way it is. We have ordered mango lassi, sweet lassi, chicken tikka musallam and chicken reshmi kebab. All of them were equally bad."
4,"A small ""fast-food"" restaurant with a great flair and delicious Burritos (also very spicy if you want though)! I can only recommend to go there, but be careful : you have to pick a good moment because it is really often full and you will have to wait a little bit..."
4,"Fantastic cafe in St. Pauli for sunny days. There's a little ledge outside you can enjoy your coffee on, and it catches the morning sun perfectly. Delicious bread, eggs, meat, cheese and salad. And nice people. Recommend."
3,"Little surprised to see this place get only 3.5 stars, since I think pretty much everything about it is great. (""Yay! I'm a fan,"" even.)Ambience: trendy, modern - great lighting.Food: well-prepared, nicely presented. The fruit with muesli for breakfast is a choice way to start the day; the half-salad/half-soup lunch combo was fantastic the day I had it.Coffee: Does the job! They also have a pretty full range of espresso drinks."
4,"Chocolate Museum Tour is normally in German but the entire group spoke English so thank goodness the guide was able to do it in English. Made our own chocolate bars, learned about the fascinating history and process of how cocoa is produced and eventually made into the sweet sweet chocolate we know today. Worth the money! Loved learning about all of the history and procedures/stages of making chocolate."
1,Poor service and quite late served. The meet was average but they have a good wine selection. The plates were moving while I was trying the cut the meet because there is not tablecloth at all. I didnt like the atmosphere and the combination with low and high tables. Except for the wine I don't see any reason for coming back.
3,"We went to Brodersen after a hard but successful day of work in search of a decent reward. All I can say we found it in some delicious German classics that probably did not extend our life expectancy, but felt truly rewarding. I had the ""fischer frühstück""  (omelette with some type of north see shrimp named ""Krabben"") and my friend the pork filets in cream sauce. I always felt that speck is the perfect matrix for pan fried potatoes, and here this was confirmed. All was very delicious. We finished up with two large plates of ""rote grütze"" (jello made with real berries) which was also state of the art...slightly sour and not too sweet containing big fruit chunks. Very nice! I can only recommend this place!"
4,"After going there for few years, I have to admit that, this is a decent place to go for Chinese - Taiwanese ( southern homemade food style) place. It is not a place for spicy food ---  there are large group of Chinese who don't eat Spicy food !!! :) It is more southern style --- definitely! the Good thing is: when there is a big travel group eating at the back, you will have a chance to order those ""long time prepared "" dish !!! I will come for sure again ;)"
0,"What to expect from a copy of  world-famous tourist trap. Being from Bavaria myself and loving Bavarian food  this is one of the few places in Hamburg to get some. We went to get ""schweinshaxe"", a classic. (Grilled pork shank). First, instead of the typical bread dumplings, it comes with potato dumplings, ok, small issue. But the true dissappointment was the Haxe itself. It was dry and the crust (the best part) was hard as a stone. My feeling is they had put too many on the grill and just warmed up the leftover ones from yesterday, poured the fat over it and sold it as fresh. My mother in law had the pork roast, which had no crust whatsoever and was dry as well. These people are ruining the reputation of Bavarian food! its a Tourist trap. You want the real deal? Go to Munich, at least its the original trap. To be fair, I had a decent Haxe before, at the Speersort -branch of the Hofbräuhaus. But there the waitress was so unfriendly that I did not want to go again. Bad choice, obviously. I'd rather handle grumpy waitresses than bad food. I really hope for them it was just a bad day."
2,"this place deserves a lot of praise for the styles of the arts.the historical attributes of the arts are very impressive. in case you are it is your first time, it would nice to get in company with peoplehow know the place well. this will help you to explore a lot. the only thing that could make the place better is having staffs who really know what to look for with arts. in all this is a good place to spend time with visitors."
4,"Who would think that Hamburg would make the best burritos in Northern Europe? Don't leave Hamburg without a late drunk binge eating extravaganza at Jim! It is worth every euro cent left in your pocket. Great art work on the wall, fantastic staff and food beyond your wildest hangover dream come true."
1,"I definitely see the appeal here. I feel like it's more for the masses...think McDonald's, German style. And actually the burgers and fries do very much taste similar to that of McDonald's, in my opinion anyway. Even the advertising is in line with that of McDonald's as they advertise huge massive burgers, but in reality you get a thin, perfectly cylindrical and over-seasoned hamburger patty, flat mass-produced buns and misc. toppings...but at least it tastes pretty good. Again...think McDonald's but at twice or three times the price wherever you come from.If you are a visitor of Hamburg, please do not believe those that say it's the best in our city! There are many more better offerings in Hamburg.  Overall, 2.5 stars. Will you ever see me there again? Not if it's my choice. I won't deny that I thought it was pretty good, but I was disappointed overall. If anything really, it has seriously deterred me from wanting to try Block House."
4,Very good sushi and other dishes! Very nice waiters and good quality fish! Very recommendable!
4,"A very cute cafe with delicious drinks and pastries! Came here last week to meet some friends for coffee and I'm so glad they chose this spot! I had their filtered coffee and a piece of one of their in house baked cakes ( almond cake?). Both items were very tasty! The staff was super friendly and was quick to make my coffee! I was told that they make most of their pastries and cakes in house and looks like all their offerings are delicious. They had the cutest cookies and petit fours next to the register and I was tempted to buy them all! Actually later that night I got to try some more of their cakes and pastries! We tried a piece of their blueberry cheesecake which was really tasty. We also had an assortment of chocolate treats which were equally as good! There was one treat that was like a salted caramel chocolate tart...sooo good!Highly recommend this place to catch up with a friend over great coffee and delicious sweet treats. Also, this place takes only cash!"
4,"I finally made it to Zipang. The 35 minutes waiting outside in the cold were totally worth it. We started out with the gyoza, which unlike other places was not deep fried, hence the real deal. The ramen were absolutely delicious and the eismochi was to die for, specially the mango one!! Service was very friendly and quick. Will be back many times."
3,"good, solid Chinese food -- if you're hungry, you'll be happy you came to this great neighbourhood find.the restaurant itself is unassuming; it's big enough but not fancy.  service was friendly and quick when asked for, and the food came out fresh and fast. the vegetables were delicious, and all the meats we had were done tenderly and flavorfully.  prices are fair, and you do get a good portion.  as with most Chinese restaurants, the menu is designed for family-style eating  there is also a lunch menu that is served from 11am-5pm.my peeps come from Shanghai, so i never got my tastebuds trained for Sichuan-style spicy, so much of this menu was a bit off-limits to me.  however, there are plenty of non-spicy options and i can say they are all yummy!  the restaurant is off of the main street Eiffestrasse, behind a car rental place."
4,"Sometimes the popularity of this place annoys me, but that's only ever on Friday and Saturday evenings. At all other times it's really cool to have a bar that's always bustling. It's a pretty simple concept. Great lighting, comfortable seats, good drinks, handy location."
4,"For authentic and traditional northern German cuisine and ambiance, Brodersen takes the cake. This place attracts more of an older crowd, but that shouldn't stop you young folk. This is definitely a restaurant that you appreciate for upholding tradition and its' sophistication. The interior design has a nautical scheme, and it creates a very intimate and romantic setting because of the dim lighting. If you want to avoid the romance and are looking for a more casual and relaxed setting, sit outside!I ordered the Schölle - Büsumer Art, which is with the Nordsee Krabben. Being a potato-maniac, the highlight of my meal was the Bratkartoffeln (roast potatoes). However, everything else was absolutely perfectly delicious. I have no complaints. Only conflict I faced at Brodersen was that I didn't know how to properly use the seafood utensils and how to de-bone my Schölle. But now, I do!Brodersen would be at the top of my list if I was visiting Hamburg. I would highly recommend taking visiting travelers and families here for dinner. It's food, atmosphere and design create a warm and lovely atmosphere. You'd want to share this experience with others!Side note: I found this place extremely comparable to a restaurant in Montecito, CA - Stella Mare. So if you're ever in town, check it out ~"
3,"Ich habe gestern wie immer gutes Sushi bekommen, mussten auch nur kurz warten aber das ist ja kein Problem im jeden anderen Restaurant muss ich auch auf mein Essen warten.  Das nebeneinander sitzen finde ich bei gewissen Nachbarn sogar ganz geil, ich meine die Leute müssen ja auch nicht ihre intimen Pärechengespräche in einem Restaurant führen.  Nur 4 Sterne weil es gestern echt lange gedauert hat bis mal eine andere Sorte Sushi auf dem Band war."
3,"Fine cup of coffee - and such friendly service. Its a bit scruffy, but in a nice way. My son had a truly fresh mint tea = hot water + mintstick with leaves. Thats the best way to make a mint tea - love it. They also serve a fresh ginger tea. I would do that if I happened to come by again."
2,"We tried this place out due to all the positive reviews. We picked up our food and ate at home. First big miss: they forgot to include the Wasabi. Second big miss: big sushi pieces (lots of rice) but too little of the rest....you taste rice more than fish. Finally not really authentic Japanese. The folks there were super nice but I believe either Turkish or something else Middle Eastern. You could tell from the sushi pieces that this place was made for German palates where it's more about filling you up than delivering high end fish. Sure there is a crowd for this and they obviously like this place. If that's your thing, you'll be happy here. I believe the quality is OK and you could do worse. If you are into good sushi though, you may want to go up a class or two in sushi joint. It really is a totally different eating experience getting higher quality stuff. I don't eat sushi to get stuffed. I eat it for the quality and taste and you're just not going to get that at this place. Again super nice people and they do fulfill a very specific niche but this is not truly Japanese grade sushi."
3,"Very nice, however if you are British and used to hot curries make sure you opt for the hot chilli when they ask you, otherwise the Madras is pretty bland.Also for most people a small box is perfectly enough for lunch."
4,"YAY- After being to this bar countless times now already with friends or just on my own and constantly raving about how much i enjoy this place I finally decided today that along with my Latte Macchiato I'd ask the name of the bar as for the longest time now have been calling it Sofabar for obvious reasons. With a salon lounge filled with pre-loved sofas, some definitely from another era... this is undoubtedly Hamburgs most comfortable bar. This place is always at least half full even during the day and on some nights you may even have to wait to score a couch of your own, but with over twenty sofas to sink into and table service, this is an ideal place to come chillout, listen to some tunes, sit back and have drinks with friends. Not only is this a great bar with reasonably priced beers and drinks.... the coffee is worth coming for too! The great all rounder..."
1,"Cute little cafe unfortunately the service is slow and not quite attentive. The coffee is good but the food could be better, the eggs had not been properly boiled, cheese came with a bit of plastic still attached to it and the bread they serve for a large breakfast plate for two persons is only two tiny slices and two really small knäckebröd wedges. We basically had to ask for extra bread so we could finish the plate and we were asked exactly how many slices we'd require. I should also mention where we sat (at the back of the place) a few spiderwebs were hanging from the ceiling and that's simply not nice."
4,Fabulous.  I had the Endivine crepe anda glass of  Ventoux rouge.  The Roquefort sauce on the crepe was delectable.  The place is absolutely charming- including the staff.  The tables by the windows are so quaint.  This is just what I needed.
4,"Went to Das Dorf yesterday to have my BDay dinner. it was GREAT! I even got my Wunderkerze plus the obligatory service team cuddle (check out my pic). had Hamburg's traditional Labskaus (google it by yourself he..he..he..) and it turned out to be my BEST Labskaus so far. Highly recommended. as for the atmosphere: very cozy with dimmed lights, antique furniture and silver"
4,"(This review is best read in black and white while listening to smooth jazz.)It's like walking into a cliché!Just like there's a moment of eye-pain when you open the blinds a sunny day, there's gonna be a moment of awkwardness when you walk through the door into the super romantic ambience. Just power through. Make joke about it if necessary. Just power through.It's a place designed to get you into a warm fuzzy haze of happiness.Didn't like the chairs though. They're big and bulky, there's too many of them, and I don't like to perform self-origami just to sit down."
1,"This is a low-quality Indian shop in the food court of the Europa Passage. None of the entrees that I've tried taste more than just okay. It's priced accordingly to actual Indian places in Hamburg, and as the food isn't very tasty, you should avoid going here unless you're specifically in the Europa passage and don't want to walk anywhere else to get food. It's fine for Europa Passage terms. I usually eat here or the falafel place when I'm lazy and in the mall."
3,"Good place for a few drinks Nice Sofas (best for smaller groups of 3/4 on the one couch - bit difficult to talk across them) Or there's plenty of room to stand or take a stool at tables near the bar. Reasonable prices, enough room There's benches outside as well if you'd rather that in the summer"
1,"Meh. Food was ok at best. Find it weird they roll their burritos all in the morning, my friend tried to order one without chili sauce and because of said rolling, this wasn't possible. Overhyped. They try to give off this whole ""oh you didn't reserve vibe, well we are too good for you."" Kinda vibe. Blah I'll deal with said nuances of food is amazing, but again, is nothing to go nuts about."
1,"Unfortunately it's only in German. It feels a little uncoordinated when walking through the museum. There's just a lot of text/information everywhere. It was cool to see and I got a little information brochure in English, still I think such a museum, especially in such an international city like Hamburg, should offer it in both languages, German and English."
4,"I absolutely love this place. It's like the definition of hipster. It's. So. Trendy. Looks exactly like the stuff my designer ex-flatmate produced. (And he was really talented, so that's a compliment.)And they definitely know their coffee too! There's not only coffee from most parts of the world; once you start talking to the owners (I think?) about coffee, they just go full on passion lecture mode on you. In a good way.If you like coffee, I'd seriously recommend going here with a friend (special or regular kind) and  do a coffee tasting. Owner recommended trying out the same beans as espresso and regular coffee to spot the difference. And then there's of course different kinds of beans with different kinds of roasts.........Sounds like a pretty great pass-time to me.  Well, if you like coffee that is."
4,"This place is the shiznet! It's loungy and bar-like, yet good enough to bring your kids along. We did indeed bring our boys here. The waitress/bartender was awesome and spoke very English very well.  Th food - Turkish style middle eastern was great. Kids had a burger and falafel. Wife and I had Doner(Gyro basically). All that and drinks for the kids and 5 drinks for us(yeah kids drove ya crazy today - don't judge) - $55 Euros. I overtipped the waitress because the kids were being little twerps, over tired from a long day. She really did a fantastic job though."
3,Good food! And you can smoke in the restaurant inside only tell the owner you're wife or your sister is having a child in the hospital then it's ok
4,"It is delicious,,,not so expensive and absolutely clean...Best Asia Imbiss in Hamburg..."
4,"Enzo's is around the corner from the place where we live and I came here last night with my wife for a pre-birthday meal.We had walked past the place many times but either not in the mood for Italian or it hadn't been open.So we walked in without a reservation at about 8pm and luckily got a table; 10 minutes later they were turning people away. It was nice and buzzy and fairly full with a mix of locals, tourists and business people.The waiter we had spoke German with such a strong, thick Italian accent that I couldn't understand him so we ended up speaking Italian instead! Once he knew I could speak Italian the whole experience became great; I told him more or less to choose for us then the food that came was really really fantastic.After respective starters of carpaccio and truffles & grilled squid in an octopus and black lentil salad my wife had rack of lamb and I had a Sea Bass with a salted crust. All with large glasses of red wine that we weren't told the name of but that it was 'buono' from the waiter!So it ended up being probably the nicest dinner I have had in Hamburg (maybe enven Germany so far) It wasn't cheap, at over EUR85 for two, however it would be hard to find nice food better cooked anywhere, plus the welcome, service and ambience made the difference between a good evening and great one.My wife and I agreed to go at least once a month, and I look forward to the next time.Enzo, Ci Vediamo!"
4,"Can't believe I've never reviewed Olivio! A firm lunch favourite of mine (check today's pizza monza which is sat inside of me right now), this is perhaps the friendliest restaurant in Hamburg, nay, the world! A hilarious husband and wife team had us writing down our order on a piece of paper and delivering it to the kitchen today! If you go on a Friday lunchtime you often get free wine refills, not that I drink at lunch of course... Brilliant."
3,"Restaurant Engel is always a nice place to stay! With a beautiful view on the river Elbe, you can watch the container ships passing by while having a nice dinner."
4,Fresh produce and many environmentally friendly options. Slightly pricier but worth the cost for the high quality.
2,"Visited for the first time last night, and had high expectations given the hype over the opening. The location is great, the service was friendly (and multilingual), but in the end my food was just okay, and the prices are a bit high.We reserved a table online (nice), and the hostess seated us quickly out in the pedestrian area where there are several dozen tables set up. Our waiter was a friendly guy who offered the English speakers in our group English-language menus, and was available and helpful throughout the evening. I ordered the crispy fish burger with a side of fries, and the whole situation was kind of a mess. First, it's not really a burger; they should rename it a sandwich, because it's just a fried fish sandwich. Second, my sandwich was absolutely drenched in Remoulade (tartar sauce), which made it a mess to pick up and eat. So I went after it with knife and fork (German-style), but that crushed the tender fish inside the bun, which made it less like eating a filet of fish, and more like eating a flattened fish paste. The fries were fine, almost great. Sauces for fries (mayo, ketchup) are extra, something I just don't understand. Total cost for sandwich, fries, mayo: 14 Euro. Seems overpriced by at least 30%.I may give them another chance, but the first impression was not strong."
3,"Kebap shop with a  much wider menu than just kebaps. Great outdoor seating with lots of sun; on a sunny day. Additionally, they give you a free salad and bread with your order. I don't know how the kebaps are but I got a dish consisting of lamb, a yoghurt sauce and little chunks of bread, topped with a pretty hot chili. Absolutely delicious. The yoghurt was just adequate to balance the powerful flavour of the lamb. The food also gets prepped very quickly. Definitely a fan of this place for a quick bite"
3,"It's a vegan cafe in St Pauli. With plenty of seating outdoors for the warmer days, this is a nice cafe run by very friendly people. The menu is not huge but enough choices to satisfy most people's needs. They have a daily specials board and a few options for drinks. It was packed the whole time we were there and it's a relatively young crowd. I had the club sandwich special and my wife had the quiche of the day. Food tasted good but I wish there was a little less leaves and red cabbage in both meals. The cake I had for dessert was also very nice. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this is a nice option in town. Even if you are not it's worth a try :-) It's reasonable, simple and clean food. Everything is super fresh and staff are friendly."
3,"We stopped by here on a whim - the prospect of a margarita while sitting outside in the warm weather was too good to pass up.And the margaritas, and service, did not disappoint. I'll preface by saying we love margs, but only the good ones, not the sweet syrupy ones. These were incredible, handmade (took a little while) and delicious. We were also told they were bringing us Nachos which was a nice gesture but we anticipated a microwaved mess. Instead, we got a plate that was more like hot, homemade tomato / bean dip with a few tortilla chips layered in. Combined With the spicy homemade chili sauce, it was delicious. Service was great too, excited to go back for a full meal!"
3,"Whether or not 20up is your kind of scene it's worth it to come and check out the view at least once while you're in Hamburg. Floor to ceiling windows give a breathtaking view of the Hamburg harbor. When we came it was really crowded and we had to hover to get a table, but once we sat down it was really nice. The drinks here are strong and pricey, about 9-16 euros per drink.  The dress code is business casual and the crowd is a bit more on the mature side. I would put this on the beginning of your itinerary to grab a drink and tick off your list, then walk over to the bars to fill up the rest of your drinking tank. :)"
4,"We went during a weekday during lunch time & avail the lunch menu. It was not full, thus, we enjoyed a good service from them. They have a variety of dimsums to choose from. Choices for the main course is also very good. The menu have english translation/description in it and the waitress can speak mandarin. The prices are affordable. Each of the menu comes with a complimentary appetizer: soup -or- springroll. We enjoyed all the dishes (see submitted photos) and giving them all two thumbs up! The restaurant size is kinda small, but they do have two big round tables available for people coming in groups. Will definitely come back & will definitely recommend to others."
3,"There is some construction going on at the street end and so it is not very easy to locate the cafe. Cafe has a very nice seating arrangement - nothing too overwhelming and you get enough space for yourself.. both inside and outside. Prices are not superhigh - though the coffee I ordered wasn't the best I had in a while. But, nice friendly staff and you really feel that you have come to a small home driven cafe in a positive sense. Very close to the station - so you dont need to walka lot..."
4,"Excellent food, very special action. This is a unique experience! Never had a better experience in a fish restaurant!After a few days here is a little more detailed review:We arrived at Casa Franco and got an ""dude"" welcome. We were placed in the middle of the restaurant and it seemed uncomfortable at the beginning. My wife and me got seated at a 6 seater with just one couple with us. The tender told us, that he is the menu tonite, so we don't need to read. Decision was easy: he asked us if we want fish, meat or vegetarian. We decided to go with the fish menu. As start we got olives with tasty bread and kind of mayonnaise-garlic sauce. After a while the flambed scampi arrived and that was a big start!! The second course was a super tasty mix of tuna and pike-perch fish. This was the time we realized that everybody in the room took the fish menu - and they started to serve the courses simultaneously. After the second course they served a shot for everybody with general salut! After a while one of the tenders showed up with the next course - in raw format. It was a loach and a kind of a big fish! Meanwhile a guitar singer walked through the room and gave us a big Portuguese feeling with singing pretty good and impulsive!The third course arrived and that was a big one! The Loach of course and a super tasty sword-fish we're served with tasty vegetable. Each fish got his own sauce (as with every course) and it was great! The dessert was good and after that another shot arrived. Each course and shot was announced once to the entire audience.With all that, we experienced a great dinner with a feeling of being big friends to guest at friends! While leaving every women got a rose as gift and after talking to the manager and thanking big for the great dinner, he passed a bottle of Rioja to me.Thank you ""Casa Franco"" team for this unique experience! We will definitely come back!Addendum: when arriving you might think ""WTF"" but don't judge on this - this one is one of the best fish restaurants I've ever bin."
3,Enough has been written about this place. The food is great. I like the room because of the minimal styling. You can't beat the sushi in Hamburg. The location is easy to reach and parking is not a problem. My one major gripe about this place is the service. These are the most arrogant waiters and waitresses I've run acorss in Hamburg. They start to annoy you when you are making a reservation and they annoy through to the end until you leave. This really diappoints considering how good the rest is.
3,"Great sandwiches, and in general their bread and cheese plate was a perfect start to a Sunday. Their barista was good too. It was hustling and bustling with people. I enjoyed having food and people watching :)"
4,"Fantastic venue for beach-related sport in Hamburg, including football, volleyball and swimming. There are around 4 pitches, several bars, BBQs, with great music and DJs. We were there to compete in the annual Hamburg netsoccer clash, where Qype came out on top!"
4,"Gorgeous restaurant with a delightful staff. I had weinerschnitzel, which was two giant pieces fried perfectly along with the best german-fried potatoes I've eaten. I didn't care for the cucumber salad, but my wife's fish pot of three meats, sauce and veggies was delicious. We each got a soup, one crab one potato and they were fantastic.  Really enjoyed the meal here and would go back if we were staying longer!"
4,"Absolute professional and lovely, remembers most customers favourite orders, makes good jokes and even has some books for kids."
3,"Very nice service, nice setting, nice german fare and (what appears to be) local clientele. Liked it."
4,"Batman hat den besten Dürüm der Stadt. Ich war schon in vielen Dönerläden, aber nirgends ist das Dürümbrot so gut gemacht wie dort. Für jeden weiter zu empfehlen. Der Preis von 3EUR ist auch an der unteren Grenze der Durchschnittsdönerpreise. Außerdem macht der Dürüm dort so richtig satt, also für Hungrige und Genussleute gleichermaßen eine Top- Adresse!"
1,"In the 'Portuguese' area of Hamburg, a large restaurant serving Portuguese food.  We were asked if we had booked so thought the restaurant must get very busy (it wasn't at the time we got there).  We were shown to a table in a reasonably empty restaurant.Felt the menu was a bit 'samey' and struggled a little to find something 'exciting' to eat.  Leaving the starters and go straight into the mains.  The food was OK but nothing to shout about.Staff were very friendly thought and accommodated my typical English and 'not speaking any other language'.  The restaurant never became busy so not sure about the fuss of 'have you booked'.  Probably would not rush back here but OK to come back if I had to."
4,"After trying few different flammkuchen in Hamburg, I would say this is the best in town. It's a cosy place, located in a hidden corner near Schlump station. The staff is very friendly, they gave me explanations and some good recommendations . We tried flammkuchens with dates and with salmon. Both tastes awesome. The crust is thin and crispy. Topping combinations are good. A warm Jimmy herbal tea is healthy and tasty. For dessert, we tried Creme Brûlée which is only available in winter. It was not bad but there is still some rooms for improvement."
4,"I visit this restaurant for over 10 years and it is a heavan of indulgence for those who go for spectacular view, impeccable service and the best food you can get in this town. Diners can choose between different set menues, parts of it and a small extra menue of dishes all pleasing the palate. The vast wine-cellar is stocked with very rare blobs but its even more fun if you entrust the sommelier to take you on a trip around his vast knowledge of wines from around the world  all served by the glass and fitting to the plates you have chosen. Don't miss the adjacent cosy Hotel Bar for the nightcap. BEWARE: the water depth of the inner Alster Lake opposite the hotel is only 6 foot, there is no possibility for drowning after the bill is cleared!"
3,"i am visiting vesper since few months. it has an elegant decorative style, large windows give a lot and make the place comfortably spacious, home-made good quality cakes are always delicious... the service crew is precise and very friendly, they make no mistakes. I had few times dinner and i was not disappointed."
2,"they were a bit overwhelmed although it was empty, the coffee was OK and the strawberry cake didn't have too much flavour. There WiFi was out, so maybe I just picked the wrong day. The staff was friendly, but not very chatty when I was asking for directions or something to see before I was flying out again."
3,"The inside of this place makes you want to curl up with a good book, have a coffee and relax for a while. We came for breakfast and both really enjoyed our dishes. My husband got the dish that had smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and some salad type dish that looked like potato salad but he couldn't figure out what it was exactly (but really liked it). The smoked salmon had a horseradish type sauce on the side that he really enjoyed. They also served a basket of bread on the side (not sure if it was included with his) with a croissant, a roll and two other types of bread. I got the sweet pancakes with bananas and maple syrup and while it wasn't what I imagined as pancakes (think more of like a Dutch baby + a pancake), it was delicious and filling. My husband's dish definitely stole the show, though. We both said we would come back to try their dinner as several dishes sounded fantastic to both of us."
2,This is an OK bar which tends towards stylish. Fairly dark and modern atmosphere. Still fills up at times with a pretty local crowd. Prices are OK. Bartending is average. You can sit outside in the summer and people watch pretty well. Only problem I have with this place is that at times at draws exactly the crowd you would try to avoid in Ottensen. Not typical though and always a good default place for a couple of drinks. I used to really like the Hollywood Canteen which used to be at this location prior to Reh Bar opening up. Unfortunately that place went downhill after moving. I guess then Reh Bar is a better alternative.
3,"A great find! It's a small cozy place on a nice street. Really warm on a cold snowy night. They have 3 options for vegan spätzle which I was really craving. They recommended the ""cheese"" and onion one as the most traditional and I got it with smoked tofu as an option. It starts with a small side salad but then when the spätzle came out it was huge! It comes in a glass baking dish straight from the oven. The vegan ""cheese"" was really creamy. It was a bit of a struggle to finish it but it was so good! The staff were really friendly with perfect English. I'll definitely head back when I'm in Hamburg."
3,"I came here with some friends for a Monday evening dinner. The place was absolutely packed, so I'd definitely recommend a reservation if you're heading there outside of lunch. Luckily, we had one and were seated within a few minutes of arriving even though our party of 3 wasn't entirely here yet.The decor and ambience is certainly unique. In a good way, that is. The walls are decked out with what seems like a random collection of flea market finds, and the entirely unrelated music selection works to complete the experience. The waiters are also super high energy and witty, with an almost relentless desire to practice their heavily Italian-accented English. Our table was in a back corner, which made it easy to chat despite the somewhat loud setting. I'm not sure if that would also apply with the more central tables in the space.My friends recommended the pizzas over the pastas, and that seemed to match past reviews as well as what I saw around me. I got the Prosciutto e Funghi pizza. It's probably the best pizza I've had in Hamburg: really thin dough that's nicely charred from their wood-burning oven with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. These pizzas are huge, probably over 14"" in diameter, but the thin dough and toppings makes for a lighter meal than your typical, smaller pizza.At the end of the meal, they drop off the check along with bottles of grappa and sambuca and shot glasses for you to pour away. It's a nice way to end the meal even if the gesture felt a little robotic. The fruit chews accompanying that felt a little out of place, though.If you're in search for a good pizza in Hamburg or just a fun dinner out, definitely check out Luigis."
4,Best coffee I had in Hamburg. Great service and coffee knowledge. Good help finding a filter coffee to my taste. Very high quality coffee and nice people behind the counter.Also a good place to buy coffee beans and brewing equipment. Eg. filters brewers and syphons. Highly recommended!
3,Pizza Siciliana was great but the pizza Diavola was extremely spicy! I love spicy food but it was too much.
4,"Hallo an alle dort in Zwick, insbesondere Jaqualin lol! Sie wahrscheinlich nicht an mich erinnern, ich bin Kevin verwendet, um mit Ihnen in Cafe Wintergarten Arbeit an der Rothenbaumchaussee, war ich mit Ihnen zu arbeiten als Barkeeper lol!, ich kam gerade über Zwick und Ihr Foto online, nur eine kurze Anmerkung zu sagen Hallo und Sie immer noch aussehen wie Ihr Spaß haben:) Es war schon immer ein Ort zum Feiern: ') Kevin in Liverpool"

3,"Now, I was a bit apprehensive about how much I would enjoy this and how much time I could actually spend looking at miniature figures but, I surprised myself on how facilitating it all was.  All these tiny figures painted and positioned in such detail.  Every time you looked at something different you were stood for a while taking it all in.  Then you would spot something quirky going on like a naughty couple in the car or a random dinosaur lurking somewhere so then you start a little hide and seek to see what else you can find that no one else may have spotted.It isn't just figures standing around either.  Hit the buttons nearby to activate movement in certain areas.  Again, sometimes this took a while to spot what was actually moving/changing so absorbed more of your attention and time.The time, detail and effort put into everything is truly amazing and I think everyones favourite is the airport where you can want planes landing and taking off (I kid you not!).  There are things there that just make you stop and look and look and somethings which make you laugh.  You will be wandering around in here for some time and, depending on how busy it is, you will be surprised about how much time you actually spend in here.We came a little late in the evening so had to quickly move through the last part however, I know we could have spent another half hour there on just that bit having been there for probably 1 hour before hand.  We were able to move through fairly reasonable pace but if it is busy, I can imagine you would easily double this time.As they are adding countries and places to this all the time, I'd imagine you could come back in a few months to see more and spend equally as much time in here."
3,"Better than the average British indie night. Ended up here, en route to the Schanze, and stayed all night. EUR4 entry and EUR2.50 for a bottle of lager is pretty reasonable for a Saturday and the music was the same clichéd bands you'd hear in the UK: Oasis, Blur, Joy Division but with more variety- eg instead of playing Love will tear us apart they played Disorder. Not recommended if you want something quentissentially Hamburg, but a good safe bet."
4,"I found this roastery yesterday, led by my nose when I was in the vicinity. The roaster gave me a personal tour of the facilities and I had a very good (and amazingly inexpensive; all drinks are 1,- EUR) Capuccino in the café in the upper floor."
3,"The Turmbar looks quite harmless from the outside, but from the inside, a spiral staircase (minus the stairs!) will take you in circles what seems to be forever until you arrive at the bar at the top. The Turmbar is actually divided into two bars - a small one at the bottom and a larger at the top. I hadn't actually been to the top bar but spent an entire evening in the odd Inca-themed bar at the bottom, which reminded me of a bar I had visited in Disneyworld. Don't worry - even if you decide to party at the bar on the bottom floor, you'll end up having to go on up the spiral, since that's where the toilets are. Recommended for the adventurous and those who are looking for a light evening - you're probably NOT going to want to go up that spiral while plastered."
2,"Nice Place to Drink One or two coktails and have some soulfood. If you go there Be thirsty , hungry and enjoy :)"
4,"Sehr schönes, gemütliches Café/Bistro mit toller Getränke- und Speisekarte im Shenzhen Schanzenviertel. Die Pfannekuchen und Säfte kann ich besonders empfehlen. Preisklasse: mittel, aber definitiv jeden Cert wert!"
2,"Solid cheap buffet. Fairly fresh, nothing too spicy, nothing too inventive. Easy to fill up here on the cheap so you don't need to eat too heavily or expensively later (if you're trying to be a budget savvy tourist). The chicken tandoori and the chicken curry were prepared well; the meat was very tender. I thought their saag was interesting - when I took my first plate it had potatoes in it, and the second time it had broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and carrot. I will say those were unusual. I'm forgetting pretty much all the other dishes since there was nothing remarkable. There was a fried veggie thing, some slightly overcooked white rice, some other veggie dishes. The mango pudding turned out to be more like an orange colored liquid sugar as I couldn't taste any mango. Not my scene. But all in all it was worth the savings to go this route and I'm glad we did. The grated coconut and sliced almond topping bowls were a nice touch. It was a pity the fresh herb was parsley and not cilantro, but we can't all be perfect."
3,Good place to eat. Sometimes jut to crowded and so it's not easy to find a place to sit. To order goes pretty fast. The atmosphere is not the best. But good food weighers it out.
4,"This was the BEST felafel EVER! I had the Felafel with grilled eggplant - AMAZING! What makes their felafel's soooo good, is that each layer is different, no two bites are the same! With a mixture of texture and flavor you look forward to the next bite and don't want it end!"
3,Great place for a Sunday beer. In the summer at least!
3,"Almost one of ""must-visits"" in HH due to very central location, nice schnitzels and great beer."
4,"If you like interior design, you'd be pretty much satisfied in this little austrian café. Fine cakes (e.g. Sacher, Frankfurter Kranz), very delicous. And in case you are not looking for typical austrian flourfood (mehlspeisen), the hearty snacks have my recommendation as well. ""Weisswurst und Brezn"" with sweet mustard, as well as beef meatballs with salad for less than 7 euro in that kind of athmosphere, marvelous. Drinks are sort of pricy, but for the location still affordable."
3,"A very cool place in Hamburg Schanze. The burgers are excellent (150g patties). We came free to eat at 19:30 and had a small choice of tables, the place was fully booked. The potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent side order the the fantastic burger (No choice of a bun but that is okay for me).Only thing is when you go downstairs to visit the toilet you must know that is an old house. Nothing more to say."
4,"Exceptional coffee, cigars, brandy, port, long drinks, short drinks and cocktails. Great for sitting outside and watching tge world walk (and drive) past."
4,It's a UNESCO world heritage site with a fantastic maritime flair to it. Lots of traditional bars and restaurants within walking distance from here. For photography lovers I would definitely recommend you go here during blue/golden hours.
4,"A good little restaurant where you can either take away or consume inside. I am used to come the morning for their croissants or at lunch for their Schönes Grün salad which is based on quinoa, suave raspberry, beans, avocado and other green vegetables. The staff is very kind and fast, I recommend it very much!"
0,"Just had a dinner as a family of three at Khan. In short: I can not recommend.The meat quality is really low, hygiene is problematic,if you have a baby the only edible stuff is some chicken and sweet stuff.If you leave any food on your plate they will come and warn you and penalize you €5s per person that you did not eat all on your plate.Sorry, no one needs such a dinner."
3,"I can highly recommend this restaurant - we have eaten heir twice and were impressed each time. Interesting  menu, fresh ingredients and our food was delicious."
2,Not one of the most obvious or attractive restaurant fronts I have seen. And on this particular day I have to say that I dont agree with some of the other reviewers with regard to friendliness of the staff. But the food is good and genuinely Italian as is the atmosphere inside. I had a great Saltimbocca (always a good test!) and was waiting for The Godfather to turn up at any minute. Cuneo is easy to find from St Pauli U Bahn and I am sure I will return
4,My favorite place to eat in Hamburg. Lovely and quiet. Amazing food and you can feel the devotion from the two owners. Book in advance as it is only a small place.
4,"Alright... we knew this was the best always !!!Superb hospitality. Huge ballrooms and excellent catering. We had a fine experience visiting the interiors, not to forget the Phantom Room- where all the history of this hotel lies.. its my favorite...all time !!!"
4,"This place is amazing.It's not a ""fancy"" place, where you go, dress up and dance until morning light.It's a very simple bar, filled with a lot of Nerds. The Customers there either love Roleplay games (the ones with dices!), old TV-Series, Videogames or Sci-Fi or Fantasystuff.Most of the people there wear black band shirts and most of the time ""evil black music"" comes from the speakers, if not somebody gets out the guitar and playes a song.It's a rustical and cozy place, you easily feel home at, due to the atmosphere. The customers there are very open and the staff is super friendly and does its best to serve all special demands. Thier bartender is really nice and they have everything from coffee, over beers and shorts to fancy cocktails.It's a good place to have weirdly amazing conversations with people you just met."
1,"Food is pretty mediocre and the service is completely indifferent at best and downright rude and negligent at worst.  I go here very often as it is close to my workplace and there are relatively few choices in the area, especially after 9pm."
3,Great food and very attentive staff. Very good price level. Best to book in advance.
3,"Good after works, happy hours & some random students. Quite a nice location in city center, venue itself is trying to be cool and modern. Food is not my highest choice, but drinks are definitely 8out of 10! So for Thursday evening after work drink - big yes!"
3,"Once in a while, one simply wants a good steak. After being a vegetarian for a year (and previously spending my time with either fellow vegetarians or kosher-keepers), I had very little experience with Hamburg's selection of meat. After much deliberation, our party of three decided to forego the ide of an upscale steak joint for Hopi - a much recommended, affordable steakhouse in Hoheluft-Ost/Harvestehude. Service was a bit slow to start with, but our meals arrived quickly. I had a ""Hopi Steak"", which was 8.90 for a 200g argentinian beef steak, a baked potato and a piece of garlic bread. The meat was okay - a solid slab of beef, but nothing exceptional. I found it very ""gummy"", hard to cut and chew. I'm not a meat connoisseur, so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about. I finished the meal off with a very yummy tartufo. Overall, I had a good, solid experience at Hopi and I'll be glad to come back. The worth for money is quite good, I'd recommend this for anyone who'd like a laid-back steak dinner in the neighborhood at an affordable price. For me, my quest for a really great steak continues."
4,best 24 hour tuerkisch place in hamburg! love the service! have been schlepping everyone here since decades. good comfort food right when feeling a cold or flue wanting to creep out of the system!
3,"Great place, thanks yelp!Cute, authentic and very cosy inside spread over 2 floors with a mezzanine.Had a quick dinner here with my sister before heading to the airport.Had one with mushrooms and a fried egg on top. Super tasty & filling for about 9€!"
4,"update: Kentucky Fried Chicken eat your heart out! This is where the fast-food chicken is in Hamburg. So I finally tried the chicken and it was great. It was also a surprisingly manageable portion, which makes a nice change from a lot of the fast food around. The sign outside says ""Best Chicken in Hamburg since 1966"" and they might not be too far wrong.I really want to try the half-chicken and chips, as it's supposed to be one of the best in Hamburg, however when I went the other week they'd already sold out! Anyway I had schnitzel with hausgemacht pfeffer sauce and it was damn nice. I'll be back to try the chicken one of these days!"
2,"Popular for dogs and the HSV. Different paths to choose from. Dogs should be on the line, this is normally ignored, and once in a while the controllers are out and about.Near by is Lüther Park and its beautiful church. The area has cafes which I will notice for the next time"
4,"I know it says it's the biggest miniature train exhibit, but it's so much more than that! It's the worlds largest miniature model, yes there are trains, but there is also a fully functioning miniature airport with planes taking off and landing, taxying to their gates and later taking off again. There are waterways with miniature ships going around. And so much built around the trains that they actually become more of a background and the main selling point. This place is stunning in its love to detail and the plethora of jokes and social commentary you can find throughout the miniature structures. Knuffingen, the made-up name of a city that's a large part of the exhibit, and Knuffingen Airport are only the beginning, there are also Austrian, Scandinavian, Swiss and American themed exhibits as well as a large Hamburg model. They are also currently building an Italian and a France themed area. This place keeps continually growing.If you look closely, you'll find so many amazing little details that are just so much fun to find. Keep a lookout for all the little cows hidden in every single exhibit! The American landscapes also have quite a few aliens populating their own little town.Many places throughout the exhibits feature buttons you can press to trigger some action, there's a joust, an outdoor festival, a Christmas market and so much more. Definitely take your time when you go here.Between the various areas, there are smaller exhibition pieces as well as information on the technical aspect. Every spare space in the Miniature Wunderland is used to perfection.The models are also updated according to current events, whether it's all of Hamburg celebrating Germany winning the World Cup or the train station being occupied by striking train drivers, the models keep on changing and it's wonderful.Always worth a visit, whether you're a local or a tourist! Also, they have Mario and Princess Peach on their restroom doors, so yeah, they're just really really awesome!"
0,"High expectations, with zero outcome. Totally overpriced and tasteless.  The bar was loaded with unwashed glasses. Bartenders didn't wear masks and handled food without gloves, then wiped their hands on their pants. The raviolis with bacon were undercooked and the bacon could barely be cut. After waiting 2 hours for the main dish , The Spätzle was a disaster. Zero flavor and completely watered down. When I mentioned it to the kitchen, I was told they ran out of cheese. As if I wouldn't notice. Definitely would avoid this overpriced and over hyped , poorly managed ""celebrity restaurant."""
3,"The best thing about this place is that it's quiet later in the evening, which is when my boyfriend and I usually go there. It's also on the cheap side. The dishes we've tried so far taste very good. No idea if they are traditional Thai/whatever dishes, but we don't care about that as long as they taste good."
4,"Almost got a point off for the rather long wait for a table, but otherwise a delectable start to the day. Three eggs benedict with a side of Hash Brown each, (looked and tasted a whole lot like country style potatoes to me but hey, maybe thats how they do it in Canada), and three pancakes with maple syrup were as good as inhaled by myself and two starving Bavarian brothers. Top it all off as I did with a hibiscus tea and a coffee and you'll need to be rolled out of the restaurant, like I was. (Almost.) Worth the weight."
4,"It's exactly the kind of place that you expect when you're looking for a cosy, crammed and delicious Italian restaurant. This place has great lunch deals.Make sure you make a reservation when you want to go there on a Saturday evening."
1,The bar is situated in the heart of eimsbüttel. The interior is nice and cosy with lovely vintage sofas. Unfortunately we were disappointed by the cocktails. We had a Gin Fizz which quite frankly had no fizz and a Mojito which was nothing more than ok. I do hope that the coffees served are nicer as it's a lovely little place.
4,"There's nobody in Hamburg, who doesn't know this place. Why? As you walk down the street at Schanze this bar is the first that looks inviting and worth trying. And I must say, it's nice there, it's stylish, warm atmosphere, clean toilets (i have to say that, cause there are so many bars with utterly ugly WCs). Can get really packed late in the evening. Really good crowd: yound, trendy and cool people, sometimes too cool. It's not the cheapest bar, but also not the most expensive."
2,"Slightly cozier than sister locale mi-chii with all its concrete, the original O-ren Ishii is still geared toward fast eating prior to dinner hours, with five changing dishes every day, all around 10-13€. Benches and stools are simple, hard, with very few seats even boasting as much as a backrest.Food started more pleasantly, with a delicious spicy home-made lemonade. This was followed by absolutely brilliant spring rolls; airy, crispy, just perfection on a bed of fresh herbs. Do not miss out on those if you eat here!Unfortunately, my main course let me down again: I got a Vietnamese-style rice bowl with a generous helping of chicken, but they somehow managed to make a ginger-chili sauce dull and boring. A spicy, bland dish, and no other sauces or dressings available to at least dilettante things up...As much as I loved the starter course: the bland main, as well as the uncomfortable seating would not entice me back."
3,"The Kornhauskeller is a nice, small restaurant with very friendly staff. The lunch menu is rather small, and they offer some German and some Syrian dishes. I had Falafel for lunch, which was truly delicious and cost me only 6,40EUR."
4,"Really excellent food.  Very nice atmosphere and friendly attentive staff.  Has two menus - Italian and English, both on huge chalkboard.  These are their daily specials.I'd come back!"
2,"Food was good, but there are literally wasps in the food containers.  Not sure if this will affect people with allergies, but the wasps are literally crawling on the food, and it seems that the staff doesn't care.  That's what I interpreted it as at least."
4,"This restaurant is a true gem! It's been in business and family run since the 1970s, so expect some brilliant traditional Italian cooking. I try to go every time I'm in Hamburg."
4,This is our regular as well as special Sushi place in Hamburg. Always an-above-average quality and never tiring variety of sushi :)
2,"We were there on a pretty quiet evening, but I hear that is is pretty insane during Oktoberfest.  The food was traditional southern German and pretty tasty, I had the smoked pork chop and kale, both were excellent, the pork chop wasn't what I consider pork chop, it was more like a pork loin steak, but great flavor."
4,"Rodizio is one of my fave restaurant here in Hamburg. The price is abit steep, but for the amount of food you will get at their eat-all-you-can , it is worth it esp for meat lovers. The 'servers' go around with their meats/side dishes from table to table. They will serve it to you straight to your plate. If it's a meat, they will slice it infront of you. You need to book with them 3-4weeks in advance if you wish to dine with them on a Saturday night. If you are looking for a ""quiet"" place to dine, this is NOT for you. If you wanted to go for 'ala carte', again - this place is NOT for you."
4,"Ti Breizh is one of the first places I attempted going out to eat after being diagnosed with celiac. Since all their savory galettes are 100% buckwheat, I thought it would be a fairly reasonable choice, with many things I could still eat. Although the waiter seemed a bit unsure about the meaning of celiac, he listened to my explanation, and passed it on to the kitchen, who he said scrubbed down the cooking plates several times before making my galette (as they are also used for sweet crepes with wheat). The waiter was also very patient with me, even bringing a bottle of the buckwheat beer they had to the table so I could check if it was gluten free (it's not :(). They also let me have any of the sweet crêpe types with a buckwheat base! So, I felt they were very sensitive to my condition, and I felt relatively safe eating there.The galettes and sweet crêpes are also very tasty--maybe not *quite* on par with my favorite crêperie in Paris, but it will certainly do!"
2,Discent burger restaurant whom also serve a salads - the Cesar salad comes without any chicken so you have to order that on the side (well most of the salads is without protein :-))Would have loved to taste there dessert unfortunately there where no hot chocolate left when we finished our main course. They have home made drinks (non alcoholic) which is very good.
3,One of my favourite bars on the Reeps. great cocktails. try a St Pauli Killer.
4,"Very good food here, I usually take a haloumi and falafel teller with an extra 3 falafels as I'm a hungry hippo and they are delicious, you can tell pride is taken in the food they serve.The owner likes to practice his English with English speakers and is a friendly guy."
4,"This is a great burger joint in Hamburg.  My favorite so far in the burger joints I've checked out in the eponymous city!The closest comparison I can draw is to London's Patty & Bun - Dulf's is a messy plate-full of beefy delights, customizable in many different ways and overflowing with goodness.  The restaurant sits in the Karolinenviertel, which is a millennial area with Notting Hill-like vibes and tons of recent grad-aged people.Dulf's Burger serves 150g patties of Charolais beef - if you have never seen this French breed of cattle, then google it - spoiler alert: they're huge.  Served atop your choice of three different buns: sour dough, sesame, or brioche, the burgers are sumptuous and the toppings are plentiful.I went for the Farmer burger on a brioche bun, which comes topped with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, a fried egg, homemade burger sauce, and overflowing with coleslaw. Dulf's range of homemade burger sauces is quite impressive too: highlights include truffle, wasabi or cumin sauce....Of course, I went for the truffle sauce.I wrote a bit more about it on my blog; beeffanatic.com/2016/11/…"
2,"Cute small coffee shop in EimsbuettelThe Speisekammer is a cute place to enjoy breakfast in the morning or a slice of cake in the afternoon.During nice weather you can watch pedestrians from their small patio or if it is too cold or rainy relax behind their large window front or upstairs where they also have a small kids corner.The cake is fantastic, the service a little slow. However, if you are not in a rush it is a good coffee shop to spend some time.+ delicious cake+ good coffee - slow service (bring some time and patience)Credit cards accepted."
4,"One very impressive model, amazing animations. I can spend so much time to look all the details."
4,"The food and service were really good! We had a little problem with the extra BBQ sauce on spare ribs, they apologised and brought a new one (even we finished most of the plate)! Really nice attitude!"
4,"We stumbled upon this place after doing a free walking tour, and I'm so glad we did! Everyone was so nice, and were really willing to help us out by explaining things in English. and the food was so delicious! I had a sandwich and my wife had the risotto with a salad. We both absolutely loved it. Great place for a great lunch!"
3,"Kornhauskeller is an extremely misleading name for a Lebanese/Syrian restaurant. Then again, they have a Wiener Schnitzel special on Thursdays, which isn't something you'd expect from your typical Lebanese restaurant.Confused identity aside, food and service are on point here. I usually go for their falafel plate with salad. The ingredients are fresh, the salad isn't just a few leaves of lettuce, the combination of dressing and harissa pairs really well with everything, and there is a good balance between salad and falafel.Service is efficient and attentive, sometimes to the point of lacking warmth, especially with the head waiter (and maybe owner?). That said, they handle large groups really well for such a small space. We had a group lunch with 11 recently and were comfortably seated inside. I don't think they'd be able to accommodate a much larger group than that, though. They also have outdoor seating when the weather warms up.For clarification regarding the two signs out front, Palmyra is the catering business (and also a much better name for a Lebanese restaurant)."
3,I don't know much about Vietnamese food and how it is supposed to taste. But I can tell you that this restaurant offers tasty food in a relaxed atmosphere. The staff is friendly even though sometimes a bit odd (not in a rude way).
3,"great food for a reasonable price, also pretty handy as it is situated next to the university."
4,"Went here for breakfast and literally cannot fault the place. Sat outside on the cushioned windowsill in lovely nostalgic autumnal sunlight and drank coffees and heard fog horns from the river. We then sat inside for our food - sharing the one table in the place with a couple of other people. Beautiful platter of meat and cheese and perfectly cooked boiled eggs. Wonderful milchkaffee and the friendliest people run the place. Very relaxed, brilliant. Deserves some points for x-factor."
0,"This place is a no go.They might look like an Italian restaurant, they might act like an Italian restaurant, and they even actually be an Italian restaurant - just a really bad one. Maybe it's the lack of restaurants around or maybe it's just because they are just not good at what they do - they forgot the Italian hospitality and service.How come all the reviews are praising this place?!?!We came here in the afternoon, quite a big group and had a table reserved for us, the menu is a bit confusing as it's full of ads and weird articles.I really felt like having bolognese which is a must in Italian restaurants and they didn't have it, not in the menu and not in the specials. In addition - I had to ask twice for everything (took them 15 minutes to bring my very-not-tasty-from-cheap-syrup Apple juice.My pasta dish was very small, so small I left the place hungry, and not even offered me some Parmesan cheese.One positive thing - the garlic Aioli, which is great."
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this place considering how long I've regularly been coming here. This is my favorite breakfast place in Hamburg. My favorite seats are in back, upstairs. This place has been a staple for me almost 10 years now. Used always come here when visiting Hamburg and before moving here. Awesome breakfasts, super nice staff, easy location, and great atmosphere. I've only been here for breakfast and can't say much about the rest of the day, but I have yet to be disappointed here."
3,"Finally a cosy café in Hamburg-Wandsbek! Manyl small rooms with vintage couches. Perfect for breakfast/bruch with friends. Larger brunch buffet on Sunday. Crowded on sunday, so I recommend to reserve a table. Perfect if you bring young kids, because they have a room with some games. One disadvantage is there is no diaper changing table at the ladies."
2,"Five years I lived next door to Die kleine Konditorei. I could have had these great rolls every day. Every morning and every evening.I could have hadBut I didn't have them every day. Not even weekly. The rolls are okay, but in my opinion it's not the manifestation of rolls worldwide there. Standing in line can be fun, I don't have to tell you. But standing in line over the street for rolls ? Only if you need buying rolls as your first event on a sunny sunday morning. So, dear English-Qype-Community, toast is all right and breakfast without rolls is all right too, even in Germany. But if you are homesick and you want to stand in queue you are welcome!"
3,"Cooko is offering a Great vararity of Vietnamese and Asian dishes. Thus everyone should find something on the menu. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the dishes are freshly & fast prepared."
4,"Very new, and very modern steakhouse located very close to the central train station.The menu is excellent and the staff tried their best to keep up with my rusty German; and helped by attempting some English which is always appreciated. The menu was good, with an excellent range of steaks and meat; all served with garlic bread, salad, fries or a potato - they even have a kids menu if thats your thing.They also had a good range of desserts should you have space left after your main.Steak was well cooked, excellently seasoned and delicious. My ice cream was good, although it did melt fairly quickly due to the restaurant being a little too warm.Service was laid back, fairly slow making for a leisurely dinner where you could enjoy your food.Prices were reasonable and my main + drink + dessert came to roughly €25 with tip included so better value than other steakhouses nearby.I recommend checking this place out if you want a good steak for a good price and with excellent service."
3,"Visited here looking to cure some homesickness, since Hawaii is basically Japan-lite. I ordered gyoza and chashu shoyu ramen, my friend had the kimchee shoyu ramen. The gyoza were very tasty but the meat inside, like other asian ground meat I've had in Germany, had a finer, grainer consistency than I'm used to. That said, the flavor was excellent.Both shoyu ramens had a rich flavor which was lovely to eat inside while listening to the cold rain outside. However, I think the soups should've been kept at a hotter temperature. Also, each bowl only had one leaf of bak choy and very few condiments otherwise. There was plenty of meat in my chashu bowl which I guess is the ""best"" part, but I like some more greens, too! Where's the nori? Is that just a Hawaii-Japanese thing?The ambiance is very calm, quiet, Japanese. Like I said earlier, sitting inside with ramen and hot gyoza is perfection when the weather is crappy out. Price was reasonable, too, whole meal was about 31 euro."
3,"Scrumptious Iranian food, generous portions, cozy relaxed atmosphere and open late. My lamb chops were expertly seared, tender and nicely seasoned. The sampler was outstanding as well. Still dreaming about that meal!"
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining, albeit oftentimes too loud. Everyone wants to be ""most important"". Whatever, these are all trust-fund babies or advertising drones and they never change wherever you are.The food is mediocre at best but there are some highlights. The place is not consistent which is probably the biggest complaint about their food. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow.....I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that threw it off. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish and we both do regularly get the Caesar salad, which actually is more like a chicken-teriyaki salad. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this and you go here knowing what you're going to get. At least the crowd is consistent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table. Of course, if you want to show off your Porsche, Ferrari, or Lambo, you can park it right out front and there are a lot of windows so that everyone WILL see that it's you. If you feel ignored, rev the engine a couple times......it's usually loud inside."
4,Boys and girls if you like rock music and if you are looking for one of the best rocking pubs in hamburg this is the place to go!
4,I was expecting to drop by for an hour or two during my visit to Hamburg.  My wife and I ended up staying over 5 hours.  And although I felt the enterance fee of 13 euros was high before I went in after I toured the attraction I didn't feel that way at all.This is the best thing to do in Hamburg hands down.  2nd isn't even close.  I'm now a mega Minatur-Wunderland fan.
4,"Entirely unique, weird, fun, and a must-see for Hamburg visitors with a few days to fill. This is what happens when you give a group of manic model train enthusiasts a few million to play with, and the results go from hilarious to stunning. Expect to spend a few hours on your feet, and not notice them go by. Usually quite crowded, so booking in advance for a specific time slot is recommended. A little restaurant/café with cute booths that simulate train seating is on the premises, so if you need to refuel you'll be set. Right next door to the over-the-top-animatronic-fest that is the Hamburg Dungeon, so it makes sense to pair those, especially if the weather's bad."
3,"We went there to grab some breakfast. They are not only a cafe but they also do lunch and other small snacks. I chose the soy yogurt with nuts and honey, which I found in their refrigerated section. They offer two different flavors of soy yogurt. They also have quite a big and tasty looking selection of sandwiches and bagels on display. Interior is nice and welcoming, prices are moderate, some are okay others are overpriced (2€ for fruit infused water) but all in all it's a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch."
4,"Ok, I'm not usually a Starbucks fan, but this location and place is awesome. The building and location are super, super, super. So pretty. As an American, I sometimes miss flavors from home. Sometimes it is lovely to taste a soy Chai Tea latte. Or banana bread. Or something that is loaded with chocolate and an insane amount of calories and just tastes American. What better way to enjoy those flavors than in a beautiful Altbau building right on the Alster?The barristas were--gasp!--friendly, seemed to have been well-versed in American culture.The secret is out--this is a great place to go to for a get-away from the stress of German life."
3,"We totally love the ambiance of the place! The start of service was fast and we did not wait very long for the food to be served. The food itself is very good! All of us have nothing to complain about our respective orders. The price is slightly higher to what we normally spend on an ordinary weekend with friends, however, it is justifiable!! End of service is, sadly, very slow. Originally, we wanted to order desserts and drinks as we wanted to stay longer... But after waiting and waiting and waiting for how long, we decided to just get the bills versus ordering anew. They have no problem with ""seperate"" bills & just need to request for it. I wanted to give them 4.5 rate, but as there is no 0.5 they ended up at 4. We will definitely go back!!"
3,"Starbucks is usually good. I've been to this one several times already and I like it, but I have a few remarks.The last time the guy didn't prepare what I ordered. It was a quite night, so there is no excuse. I preferred not to tell him about his mistake and just took the drink.Often there are no tissues or soap in the toilet. W.t.f., Starbucks in the heart of Hamburg!And something positive: I recommend the 1st floor seats by the window. There is a nice view, better than the one on the 2nd floor."
4,"Dank stinking grungy hole of a bar. Which I like. We saw a pretty intense gig on Saturday night (experi-mental rock), hooked up with some randoms and crashed a house party afterwards. If you don't like overheated, overcrowed hellholes... stay away!"
4,"Wonderful cafe for breakfast, desserts or fancy coffee drinks. The warm crumble with ice cream was a special favorite. It has a very warm and cozy atmosphere."
4,"全汉堡最好吃的pho！ Best beef pho in Hamburg. Came at dinner time, the place is crowded with hipsters. The food was really really great, especially the soup in the pho. It has the rich flavor of beef, or in Chinese ""鲜"". I tried ice green tea this time, it is just ok, but my friends ordered lime ginger soda, she said it was good. Maybe try some other drinks next time."
3,"I met a friend for dinner the other night and we had a great time. We decided to share a pizza (because they are enormous) and salad and decided of half Hawaiian / half spicy sausage. When the pizza came, it was already cut in two with half of each kind on a plate for both of us. Man, Germans think of everything!The restaurant was quite busy on a Thursday evening but we managed to get a table in just a minute or two. You can grab a hefeweizen at the bar while you wait.Overall, I think the Yelpers are spot on about this place: a solid 3.5+ stars for pizza, salad, and beer. I'm rounding up to 4 because the waitress brought me an English menu without me having to bear the embarrassment of asking. Danke schoen!"
3,"The name of this restaurant is fitting for my wife and I as we have ""desired"" to dine here for quite some time. Still we wonder sometimes what took us so long. If you've walked along Gertigstrasse at any point on a beautiful and warm evening you will notice that Deseo is one of two very popular tapas restaurants that are always seemingly buzzing. The vibe here is definitely more upscale than Arcada, just a half block down, and it's also reflected in the prices. The food here is very good though and very much worth a go.A reservation almost seems mandatory when dining on the weekend, and I would highly recommend it. Having made our reservation just a couple days prior, my wife and I studied and salivated over the menu, pretty much knowing exactly what we'd order once we arrived. We started off with complimentary bread, aoili and olives, which all of were great. We then proceeded to order the pimientos de Padrón, goat cheese with potatoes, chorizo, bacon-wrapped dates, prawns in garlic oil, and calamari in garlic oil. Every dish we had was savory and delicious; ones that I would definitely order again.Service was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice here as my wife and I indulged on our ""desired"" dishes and observed life passing from our window-bar seating."
3,"When in China, I learned that the quality of restaurants there does typically not correlate with its interior. So I wasn't worried that the ""Chinese am Fleet"" is located about as unpoetically as you can go in Hamburg, and oozes that cheap corner Chinese charme of decades lost. At the off time I visited, the only other customer was a Chinese-looking guy slurping his rice, which I took as a good omen as far as buy-in by the Chinese community at large.""Chinese am Fleet"" seems to cater to two kinds of customers: the lunch break crowd seeking hearty grub for 7€, and people craving authentic yet inexpensive Chinese dishes for a few more bucks (expect 12-16€ for most dishes). Second group, the first two pages in the menu are for you!There is much variety to choose from, with a spiciness warning for most of the authentic dishes. Portion sizes are very generous - obviously you'll have more fun as a group to share Chinese-style, otherwise this will likely be a very meat-focused experience. The pork belly dish I sampled tasted really good, rich and fatty as it should be, nicely seasoned.Don't worry too much about the spiciness warning - even at the highest rating, the food remains nicely edible. Thai nationals will still need to apply some extra chili.So - it's not the most authentic or best Chinese dining experience I had in Germany, but can more than hold its candle among Hamburg's everyday Chinese options."
2,Fast service. Decent food. Nothing special but delivers what is expected. Caesar salad was more dressing than salad. My kids loved the place. Go figure.
3,"Indian Food in HH for the first time. The first impression wasn't very good. The spot looks a little bit dirty, empty to-go boxes lying everywhere trash bins overfilled, but the inside smells great though. We ordered two different chicken dishes and we were positively surprised. The food is really tasty and prepared very fast. I would give 5 stars if the place was cleaner and not so chaotic."
2,"Had a moderately-sized schnitzel here for lunch today. It really hit the spot without being amazing. I ordered a Jägerschnitzel (comes with Mushrooms), but those who ordered just a plain schnitzel got monstrously big ones! The service was unintrusive and reasonably prompt. The prices are great. Schnitzel and fries for 5eu :) --- Further to the above review, I've since been back twice. The first time was much the same, but the second time they were incredibly inattentive and slow. It took them literally 15 minutes to notice that our group of 15 had walked through the door. They then took forever to bring a few of the meals, and my schnitzel had a large fraction of inedible gristle in it. I'd still go again, but they're losing a star off the rating."
1,"Mutter, a bar I have never managed to get into. No, not because of their door policy, but because all of the smokers of Hamburg and the rest of the world now congregate here and chainsmoke like beagles in a Huntingdon life sciences lab. Not I'm not one to whinge about passive smoking, far from it. But when the only way to survive in a bar is to don scuba gear well, it's over for me. I can't swim anyway."
2,"We went to Brauhaus Joh. Albrecht with four other guests for their last night in Hamburg and we wanted them to taste German dishes. We booked a table for 9pm. They took a while to take our order but the dishes went pretty fast. The dishes were what we expected and quite good. Then, we waited 30 minutes to order some desserts but they never came to ask, so we had to get up and ask them. After taking our order, they came back to tell us that the kitchen was closing so they couldn't serve us desserts. Hopefully, after repplied them that we waited 30 minutes for them to come and take our order, they agreed on doing it. The dishes were quite expensive regarding the service and the only thing they asked, was if we wanted to let a tip..."
4,"Ich liebe den Elbstrand, schon im Sommer grillen oder picknicken ist schon was schönes. Aber nicht nur im Sommer kann man am Strand spazieren gehen, im Herbst ist es auch ganz schön mit Schatz, ner Decke und nem heißen Kakoa =)"
4,I saw this place on yelp. The staff spoke English too!!I was welcomed by the owner and was treated very well.Your journey starts with feta cheese accompanied with herbs. The feta cheese was very very fresh and good!!I ordered a lamb sultani and it was amazing. The steak was luscious and so was the koubideh. Also their yogurt drink was pretty authentic and worth a try!!Do try this place if you like Persian food.
4,"Really great Vietnamese street food obviously made fresh, very flavorful! A nice menu with some unique options to choose from including the popular Pho soup, grilled pork on noodles, or their specialty drinks (like the Gingerly with lime/mint/brown sugar, tangy yet sweet). Reasonable prices, but if you come at the prime times for lunch or dinner you will have to wait for seating since it is a small place (worth it though!)."
3,Tasty and fair prices. One of my favourite places for sushi in hamburg!
3,"Nice cosy little pub. Service was very friendly, beer was cold. An open air market was happening in the square right next to this place. Good selection of dishes, the wurst salad was quite good.Came back for breakfast on Sunday. Three eggs, potatoes and sausage was fabulous, just the thing after a long night in St. Pauli"
3,"Pretty good Indian food restaurant. We tried the chicken tikka masala, paneer curry and garlic naan. The food came out fast and looked really nice. They put nice little vegetable decorations on top of all their dishes. Not sure if this is needed to be honest, as the focus for me is the taste, not the decorations on top. It was my first time here and we agreed that the curries were simply not flavorful enough and tasted like tomato paste. The Indian curry spices were just not really there. The garlic naan was the highlight however. Hot and buttery and crispy. It could have been a bit more fluffy though. All in all, a pretty good place for Indian food if that's what you're in the mood for. However the search continues for me for the best Indian food in hamburg."
2,"This HB location in Hamburg is not as good as the Haufbrauhaus in Munich, Berlin or Las Vegas. The food is all the same great quality however the atmosphere is not as festive as the others. We came in on a Thursday evening at about 6:45pm. We were met at the front door by two muscle bound ape security guards that seemed to intimidate customers by their presence. We, however were seated right away even though we did not have reservations. The service was good and prompt, however there was no live Bavarian music after 7pm like the others, just the football game on tv. The food and beer was good as expected, but not much fun after that."
4,mr t burger changed my life! chipotle chilli sauce is digusting but every taste is different. the portion of sweet potatoe fries is too small for 4 EUR. overall its one of the best burger i had so far. thanks mates!
4,"You'll never be disappointed with what ever you choose at Herr Max! They serve lots and lots of great cake.. My fave is Cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. Their cheesecake is the best cheesecake ever! The tanginess from cheese and lime is well balanced with the moist sweet biscuit base. And the chocolate mousse cake is not too sweet, so you can enjoy the richness of the chocolate. 3 layers of pure joy!"
3,"If you want to try out some authentic mexican food and drink way too much Tequila then this is the place to come. I had an enchilada like never before. Cocoa sauce, which sounds odd but is actually pretty delicious. The staff were pretty attentive dashing back and forth with the lime, salt, tequila and san miguel. A good place to have a works party as it's going to be pretty quiet midweek, and so you can take over the bar. With my recently discovered love of burritos, it made me one step closer to believing that the best cuisine and venues are mexican. Will be going back to see what the burritos are like."
4,"Great pub and delicious food. Had grilled brandy chicken with yummy creamy mushroom sauce. My husband had the traditional fish and chips but without the chips and more salad. Got ourselves beer and shandy to finish our dinner. The food was just awesome, having to eat in a classic pub ambience."
3,"I've been there only once on a sunday.the place was packed, but we did manage to find a table.The waiters are friendly, but not too friendly. which is great in such places.The food is really good, and not expensive.However on sunday its VERY loud, a lot of families, children, babies, running around and shouting at the top of their lungs!"
4,"One of the best steakhouses I've been to  and certainly the best I've been to in Hamburg.I had a Carpaccio with pumpkin pesto, rucola and parmesan as a starter, a 200g (ladies cut) filet as the main course with a side of green beans and bacon. For dessert, a plate of chocolate mousse and brownies, garnished with red fruits.A two-person meal dealt damage of about 150 euros. Considering how much I enjoyed my food, not a large price to pay. Certainly not a cheap restaurant (the starters alone are close to 20 euros a plate, the 200g filet was 35 euros, the dessert 12) but well suited for a once-in-a-while indulgence.Recommended for those who like meat and aren't afraid to get creative with their eating."
2,Das Essen ist ganz gut und der Service ist auch sehr nett. Aber irgendwie fehlt mir hier der pfiff. Warum kann ich auch nicht genau sagen aber bisher war ich 2x da und ich war nicht ganz überzeugt aber ich komme bestimmt wieder!
4,"3 Zimmer Wohnung is a hybrid between house-party and laid back pub, with a dose of early 70's flair, a shot of late 90's tune mix and a bunch of people you don't know. Yet. The pub is divided into 4 sections; the kitchen (also the bartop), the living room, the bedroom and a small kicker area. All of these are dimly lit, and have shelves of random books and tidbits scattered around. In the living room, we found a half-dressed Barbie doll and a 1988 Guinness book of Word Records. While I wouldn't actually consider hitting the sack at ""3 Zimmer Wohnung"", it seems to be a great place for a laid-back evening excursion, especially as the music is low enough allow you to have conversations with your buds, but loud enough to sing and jiggle along. Very recommended, can't wait to go back!"
4,"The original Mo Griller and the Currywurst is the bizzomb!!  I went here four times during my one week in Hamburg.  It would have been five but I missed them by 2 minutes on my last day, so sad, haha."
4,Very nice coffee and cakes. It's a tight squeeze in there and a popular place. The Japanese filtered coffees are too pricy but the normal coffees are yummy and worth it :)
3,so far my favorite coffee place in hamburg! you can choose from two different types of (locally roasted) coffee beans and the barista seemed to know what he's doing. will be back!
3,The Goldfischglas is a nice bar at the Schanze. The menu offers the usual drinks and a few cocktails. It was very crowded and noisy. There is a tabletop football available. Enjoy
4,A lovely little wine bar with a tranquil ambience. Nice selection of wines even though the menu is only in German. Lovely appetizer available to accompany the wide selection of wines. The service is nothing great but nothing to really complain about. This place also doubles up as a Wine shop. Recommended for Dates or couples evenings.
3,"Really good dim sum. Some of the best I've had in Hamburg. In truth I regret not getting more of the main dishes here. I had a few with aubergines that were actually really good and would have liked to order more.But what can I say about the dim sum here? Chicken feet, rice rolls and dumplings oh my! Well worth a 20-min U-bahn to get here and enjoy this places specialties."
4,Slowly becoming my Stammcafe in Eimsbüttel- the thing I like most about Zeitraum is that its not too full or loud- on the weekends the cafe will fill up but you can still grab a table and concentrate on whatever book or newspaper you are reading. There are a lot of magazines and newspapers up near the front and on the way out you can grab a DVD two doors down from Filmraum (they must be run by the same folks). Drinks are good (very nice green tea and rooibos combinations) and prices are fair- I have not tried the food or the brunch yet but it looks like your standard Hamburg cafe menu and is mostly (if not all) organic so plus one there. This place would be really cool to rent out for a birthday party- I might just have to do that
4,"Great DJ, great bartenders, inexpensive drinks, friendly and fun patrons!  Did I mention the bartenders are good looking?  What more can you ask for?  Well, I guess the bathrooms could be a bit better.  If you are in Hamburg, this is definitely a cool place to come check out!"
3,"Great French pastries and good coffee as well! Nice tortellettes and eclairs. Friendly service. Has cute French photos decorating the walls. Is unfortunately a bit too small for my taste (also no toilet)  there were only 2 tables inside, making it more of a Stehcafé where you can stop for a quick yummy French treat. Wish they could expand so you could really enjoy sitting there for a while!Recommended for a short stop in Paris!"
3,"Shiso is favorite lunch spot near work. Fun Asian-ish deco inside with a fusion burger menu. The shrimp burger is my favorite and totally dog their fries. If I am not getting the shrimp burger, it can be a hit or miss with the rest. The most common problem being the burger being too smaller than the buns and sliding out with the sauces on the steamer basket. Oh yes, they serve the burgers and fries in steamer baskets, pretty neat!The pineapple mint shake is a must!"
4,A good quick overview of Indian food and taste in the center of Hamburg. Super cheap small 4.90 and large portion 6.90. Totally recommend this place if you are a tourist and would want a quick food. Very crowded
0,Great wings. But worst service ever!!! Takes ages to get your food if and just if they do't forget it!
4,"Mr. Kebab is a turkish restaurant with an really accelent service. You can't compare it to the common opinion of turkish food, like Dönerbuden. Like I said, the service is brilliant and the food too. Yummie, really a lot and you can pay it. My advice: The Grillteller for two (it's enought for 3 easily even for 3 men) And: Got to the toilette there. It's an experience ;)"
4,"delicious ramen! perfect ramen texture, tasty soup with fresh ingredients. fast service and affordable pricing."
1,"Just had the lunch buffett.  Not good.  All of the hot food in sauces have thick gelatinous skins, the tempura is soggy, the sushi stale.  Avoid this place, even the beer is bad.  How do you screw up beer in Germany?  We were the only two people in the place for an hour in the middle of lunchtime on a Saturday."
4,"Can't believe I haven't written a review of this yet. When I arrived in Hamburg I heard much about the history of Absinth bar, but wasn't able to go there as it had just shut down. However, daily I saw the guy trekking through the streets of Hamburg covered in brickdust, on the 1.5 year epic to refit the place. It was definitely worth it. Very very chic. Tasteful furniture and a minimalist wrought iron and glass bar. Cool. And they play jazz in here. Well, actually, of course they place jazz in here. It's cool. Like 60s cool. Old school cool. This is one of the best bars in Hamburg, so make sure you drop by. And don't drink anything other than absinth. One of the dev team disgraced themselves having a soft drink. Shocker."
3,Food was good not great! However the ambience was some what comfortable. Staff was kind and prompt.
4,"Couldn't agree more with a lot of the reviews, definitely the best place to get currywurst in Hamburg. It was served in the traditional way, chopped up and with a fresh roll for mopping up all the yummy sauce. Rain or shine you can huddle round a table and awkwardly try and eat this delightful from a paper tray which pigeons swoop in around you. Not a gourmet dining experience but a must do in my opinion."
4,"Easy atmosphere for an English speaker.  Good selection of local and regional beers.  I started with a sampler flight and moved on to local bottles.  Staff was willing to help with my selections since I didn't have knowledge of the region.  Bartender even went back to ask the owner about a selection she choose for me and then changed it on his suggestion.  Limited snack menu, but the pot roast style burger was good.  I'll be back."
3,"Very much Italian ran and very, very good. Although you sit inside, most of summertime business happens just off the sidewalk. I have even watched a dude ride up to the counter on his bike, order, pay and leave--all without bothering to dismount. Overall, if you happen to be in the area--and are jonesing with the 'you scream I screams'--by all means stop, walk or roll in for a cone. If are on a quest for the 'Best in Hamburg', Eiscafé Veneziana will at least make the short list."
3,"Very nice bar in the heart of Altona/Ottensen district - don't even try an attempt to come by car - either walk or if 5-10 minutes walk is too far, take a taxi/cab. They have 2 areas to sit outside - left and right of the entrance. No tables though, just some benches (beer garden style). Drinks are not better or worse than in other bars, but I like the atmosphere and you will directly spot why this place is called ""Reh"" (""Deere"") when coming inside."
2,"Disappointing for an Aussie who had hoped for a more healthy version like back home. Also the burrito couldn't be picked up due to size and how runny the insides were. Slow service (only one guy in the kitchen during lunchtime!) but I'm getting used to that in Germany. They mean well and seem nice & friendly but kinda missed the mark for me. Maybe I try the quesadilla next time, most people seemed to order that."
4,"Staff was friendly, explained all the items, and was a lot of fun to talk to. Everything we we tried was very good. Good music for the vibe too"
3,"Dean and David is a nice place to have lunch in the city, as it is located close to the main station. I tried the curry, which was very tasty. The staff was very nice and I liked the interior as well. It is simple but very nice.You need to go up some stairs to get to the restaurant."
2,"After eating here twice and the restaurant next door (Falafelstern) twice, I'm not impressed by the taste of the food at Kimo, so I'd definitely recommend going next door for falafel instead. I've ordered the large falalplatter here twice, which for 5.50 euro comes with a large variety and decent quantity of food. The falafel is decent tasting, and five balls are included. There's also a basket provided with a few pieces of flat pita.Kimo does have more choices and a less fast-food feeling, but I'd still go to Falafelstern hands-down because I find the falafel and other ingredients much tastier."
2,"Pretty nice pub in Grindel to hang around and listen to the chatter of expats. I like going to theme pubs/restaurants and this one is pretty well executed (though doesn't top the Turm Bar's tiki experience or the Bond's 007 atmosphere). I ordered the Spud Chips (which for some reason my colleague assumed to be thick fries, turns out they were really just potato chips) which were very nice, but I only received my order after waiting close to 20-25mins and having to remind the waitress that I hadn't actually gotten anything. I'd love to come back here for a bit of something to nash over a glass of beer - but won't come here if hungry. Reading the rest of the reviews, looks like slow service is the Down Under default."
4,"Mr Kebab has another follower! This place seems to function as a hybrid of a proper restaurant and a fast food joint, and they've succeeded in keeping the best of both worlds. Fast service, cheap, but top quality food in pleasant surroundings, and unlike most kebab places I've known they also serve beer and other alcoholic beverages. The menu is extensive and portions are generous. I ordered the Iskender Kebab, a bowl of meat - wonderfully tender and juicy - and bread covered (entirely) in garlic yoghurt. Delicious."
4,"Great spot for Polish food! My friend recommended this place as he said this is like his comfort food. I can see what he means as the food is very hearty and reminds you of home cooked meals immediately! A couple of friends and I met up for dinner and drinks on a Sunday night here. I hear that this place can be very crowded so it is best to call ahead and reserve if you can. We we got there though, there was plenty of room, but they did indicate which tables were reserved and at what times. For my drink, I ordered the Parliament mule which consisted of vodka, ginger, and I think bitter orange? It was very tasty and refreshing. Reminded me of a mimosa but with a vodka kick!For our appetizer, we shared a plate of pickled vegetables and we also nibbled on fresh bread and dip (on the house!). The pickled vegetables assortment was pretty interesting. There were not just cucumbers in the mix but also little squash veggies and tomatoes as well. It was a great start to the meal. My friend mentioned that you usually start with the pickled vegetables and shots of vodka. I think that sounds better so I might try that next time! :)For my entree, I ordered the mixed plate of pierogis. It comes with 8 pirerogis (mix of vegetable and meat ones) and some sour cream sauce for dipping. I was a little bit scared 8 pieces would not be enough but the pieces are packed with vegetable and meat fillings so yeah in the end... I was happy and full!It's a great spot for dinner and drinks as they have their own spin on cocktails and the classic choices for your beers. The food is all really great and reasonably priced! I need to come back to try the borsch! :)"
3,"This place has pretty tasty food since re-branding. It used to be called something else and had a similar selection but different design and less outdoor seating. I usually get Müsli or Muffins to go plus coffee. At lunch they have great soups and salads plus a bunch of changing options. I've always been happy with the food. Unfortunately the place has become quite trendy and especially when the weather is good, a ton of people swarm it. Then it takes quite some time to get your food as service behind the bar seems disorganized. Nevertheless it's definitely worth coming for breakfast or lunch as the food really is good. It's all smack in the middle of town so a good option if coming in to go shopping or whatever."
3,"Why has nobody ever reviewed Rosi's Bar in English? Could it be because whenever the English end up this far into a St. Pauli weekender they can no longer differentiate between any of the bars on Hamburgerberg?! I suspect so. Anyway, Rosi's trivia: the girl with the dreads from Zoe 2 DJ's here at the weekends sometimes. It's always packed Thursday till Sunday morning. It doesn't look anything like the photo, cause you have to imagine the mass of people sprawled on the pavement. All good fun, and probably better than the Reeperbahn"
4,"I went there for dinner and my expectations were not only met, but highly exceeded. Locally bought food, cooked by an extremely friendly staff. I had homemade pasta, with lentils and sausage, and some salad. Everything was fresh. I highly recommend this place!"
3,It was good. Price was good. Service very friendly.  Location is convenient right by the train station.
4,"Absolutely great food at the in house restaurant. The Chef made easy, healthy fare of the baked Perch fish with a creamy (basil?) potato side €13, green salad was super fresh €6 and tasty soda bread with a mustard honey butter spread. The hotel rooms are small but very nicely appointed, firm beds, goose down comforters and clean."
4,"I'm from Hamburg and I think it was a lot of fun! I saw a lot of people complaining that they didn't understand much when they went there, because it was all in German. Well, I understand that the flyer is in English too, and if you'd do a little bit of research you""d know that they have English tours on Fridays and Saturdays at 10 am.I took my american boyfriend there and he said he had no problem understanding anything and that he loved it. I just wanted to give the tip that they do have english tours, and you can book the tickets online, they are cheaper and you wont have to wait in the cold or outside. When you know the right tricks you wont ever have to wait and it will be great! Also you always have to pay for pictures wherever you go, like in amusement parks, its just a thing to be expected"
4,Ticks all the right boxes. Decent range of Asian dishes at affordable prices. Big portions and always excellent customer service. I'm a regular and a big fan.
2,"A pretty good and moderately priced Kebab restaurant in Sankt Georg. The location is quite nice if you're looking for something to eat before a screening at the Savoy theater. There are quite a few choices and the Dürüm that I ordered was quite tasty, but could've been a little fresher."
1,"Extremely dissapointing. We went there for a casual family dinner in the winter of 2016. The location is nice-harbour view. I am pretty sure that in summer, the restaurant will be a great attraction. The staff is very polite, atmosphere is neat, clean and stylish. However the food was not that great. Firstly, they gave some fresh warm bread with a tomato sauce, which was delicious. But then, the starter-Bouillabaisse was bland. No proper seasoning, taste, it was too watery. For entry, I ordered turbot wrapped in bacon and risotto. Risotto was well done, but the fish was raw, it was probably frozen. The vegetables next to it was just way too bitter and overcooked. I do not know why the vegetables turned out greyish brown, but there was way too much lemon and/or ginger that made it too bitter I think. I did not order any dessert, however I did tasted my mom's dish, which was creme brulee and white chocolate mousse. There was nothing special with the mousse. I wish they put some liquor to make it more interesting. The creme brulee was way too hard. The top must crack as soon as you hit it lightly with your spoon but we had to use some force. The taste of the dessert was alright, but in my opinion not being able to cook soup, fish, vegetables, creme brulee is simply dissapointing for this restaurant.In conclusion, I would only go to this place in summer, to drink wine or beer, to enjoy the view. I would not pay for the food."
4,"We fully enjoyed delicious, creamy pistachio ice cream in home made waffle. A ball of ice cream was surprisingly large, which makes this place very affordable. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. Last, but not least, a special feature for kids - there is a swing outside!"
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner here. My galette was stuffed with prosciutto, mushrooms and cheese - you really can't beat that! It was very tasty. My husband did not enjoy his galette because he mistakenly thought ""andouille"" was the New Orleans style spicy sausage. Let's just say this version had too many innards, not enough spice and a funky a metallic scent. He couldn't finish it, but I do not blame the restaurant since it was our ignorance.I recommend reservations or else you might not get a table. We did not have a reservation and they sat us, but advised our time would be limited until the reserved party arrived.Gluten free dining notes: 100% buckwheat crêpes are gluten free, and they will gladly substitute them for the wheat dessert options!"
4,"This place really impressed me, the location is right in the heart of the city's Reeperbahn area. You can have live food cook right in front of you, it's a very novel way of eating which gives you a very different experience in eating. You can be as involved in your meal as you like or you can just let the chefs cook your food, there at 4 different stages and each one is excitingly good offering a wide variety of meats, even a Bar BQ section. Defiantly best to book first, as this place is very popular."
4,"I came here for breakfast and it was very good. I got sunny side up eggs with toast. The egg yolks were way over done, but besides that it was very good (and the chives in the eggs were good - although they are .50 euros more). The fruit in yogurt was okay - nothing special, but the fruit itself was very good and a generous amount. The ginger tea was also interesting."
3,"Immense burgers here in Hamburg. Well worth the hunt to find the place (middle of a housing estate near St Pauli) for the reward of a super tasty patty.The muffin bun is a bit out of the ordinary, but it does work quite well. The chips are very good too, however the portion size is BARBARIC. have a look at the photo I posted. It's enormous.A great place and some really good craft beer options, again which is usually difficult to find in Hamburg."
4,Was very impressed with this stylish and cool restaurant which used to be an old warehouse. It is very different to any restaurant I've been to. The food was also very tasty and the staff were very pleasant.
3,"Very nice service. Ambiance is good as well. If you are coming in a large group, reserve a table first in advance as they can be easily filled up. We enjoyed the experience & will be coming back again soon."
3,"Bulgogi burger with extra cheddar, twisted fries and pineapple mint shake. Delicious, kind service although the home made fries my kids had were a bit flaccid. Lychee limo was to die for according to my 16 year old! Would definitely come back and try the other special burgers!"
3,"Preparation takes a while but it's worth to wait. It's  a jumbo tortilla, expect nothing less, make sure you are really, really hungry before you go in :)"
3,"Nice cozy restaurant featuring Franconian cuisine and drinks.Pros: Friendly, multi-lingual staff with English menusPet friendlyCons: Pet friendly"
3,"Greatest bun bo hue! Beefy broth with a little kick to it, but not too much. Comes with bean sprouts on the side. Yummy! If I lived here, this would be the place to get my fix. Skip the prawn spring rolls though, pretty boring and flavorless. Tra da tea good but a little pricy."
3,"Update: So after now having been here a bunch of times, I remembered to come back and update this review. i almost forgot to do so but steak places have a special place in my heart. Long-story short, the place has come into its own. It's still a bit generic, hence only four instead of five stars. There is a bunch of new waitstaff so I guess they dumped people who were not up to par and have finally found people who'll stick around for a bit. We had great service again so happy on that front. I've basically only been here with guy friends (my g/f is just not into it) and everyone is always pleasantly surprised. Best bet is to come here when you want good food, are with a group and know everyone is going to drink. The outdoor area is as expected fun so definitely an option for outdoor seating. Food has remained consistent and really good. I know a bunch of people who've complained about things here but they must just hit my sense of taste. I always like the burgers, find the fries really good and the steaks with spinach are the best. This place remains an indulgence for every couple months and I'm glad they came to Hamburg. It seems like they'll stick around for a bit. With a heavy heart I am only going to give The Bird three stars at this point. I've often been to their location in Berlin and really am a big fan. The combination of great steaks and burgers, with a bit of a rockabilly atmosphere mixed in with attitude and grunginess familiar to Berlin excel at that location. I awaited patiently the opening of the Hamburg location which I received the scoop on pretty early (someone knew someone and so forth!) Anyway, the 30th of April opening night was in my calendar real early. So we went and unfortunately had too high an expectation. Don't get me wrong. The food is just as it is in Berlin. You either like it or you don't. I like it and the burgers in my opinion are awesome and the steaks are always exemplary and consistent (although I only had a burger last night......steak next time!)So why only the three stars? Well it could be because it was opening night and we will be back, so take these three stars as only preliminary for me. Anyway, some things were just off. The restaurant itself isn't ""done"". There's no real deco on the walls and it's too ""clean"". Actually with the funny painting/light ceiling thing in the middle of the restaurant area it looks like a Turkish bath renovated into a cheap Italian restaurant. Did they not get some kind of interior designer involved in this process? The lighting is off too. Granted, some lights were obviously broken but the lighting is crap. Screw the modern stuff.....throw some candles on the tables and make it a bit more intimate/moody/whatever. With the fluorescent ceiling fixtures, it's just wrong. The tables are too new and modern. Why didn't they just go out and buy up a bunch of old, beaten up benches or tables from an insolvency sale. There is so much more character in something like that and more so than this Ikea style suburban dining set set-up they have. Somehow this all has to ""age"" and get a bit beaten up before I'll truly accept it. We'll see how time changes this place and I hope they ""finish"" decorating because right now it seems clearly unfinished.Staff were super nice. We had the Brazilian guy and two girls (everyone speaks better English than German.....as in the Berlin location) and the girls all have tats. Anyway, super nice but not yet up to speed. You have to get them informed of how things were in Berlin. Your regulars are going to come expecting what they know from Berlin. Brazilian guy was almost too nice if you know what I mean. But, to counteract that, the one tattooed girl was super nice but smelled of sweat. I guess that balances things out. :-) At least someone was a bit ""grungy.On a positive note, after we finished eating we were offered shots with our bill. The crowd was a bit edgy (wonder if it stays like this). The dog from Berlin was wandering around the place which adds charm. The outdoor benches will be awesome in the summer months, just like sitting out front in Berlin is. There is a ton of potential here. I may be over critical and it was their first night but I'm willing to wait it out. I'll definitely be back and also with a group of guys instead of the missus. This is more of a place to go with a group of friends, throw back some meat and empty a couple pitchers. Not a date-night place so do keep that in mind.Long story short, I hope this isn't the American owners getting older and settled and reflecting that in their new Hamburg place. Stay true to who you were, grunge up the place a bit and make it the relaxed, rocker-edge hang-out with great food and drink that it wants to be."
3,Really good restaurant. Highly recommend it! Please try the fried potatoes that comes with spring onions and bacon... spectacular!
4,"I felt like I'm sitting in somewhere seattle where slow hip hop music surrounding with a smoke salmon omelette. Feel home, in the middle of our journey."
3,"Nice coffee shop if you are walking in this area in the mornings.  I must admit, a stopped in here a couple times from being out all night before and would grab a coffee to freshen my mind on the way to University, haha!  Yes, sometimes we would drink during the week and I would pull an all nighter around Grindelallee and would jump onto the U3 to go home and shower then head to University for classes.  Anyways, this coffee shop is next to the U3 exit/entrance depending which direction you are headed and I quite like their coffee to go, friendly service and assortment of pasties ranging from light flakey croissants to more sweet treats like something similar of a cheese Danish.  Croissants are delicious on a universal scale of consistency, you know what to expect, light, buttery, flakey, soft, fluffy and basically delicious calories.  However, sometimes I find cheesecakes or any cream cheese pastry in Europe not quite as sweet as in the US, probably because we really go HEAVY on the sugar, but their pastries here were the perfect mixture of sweetness :)The prices are fair and its additionally a nice Cafe to sit in the mornings with a paper.  It is also nice for a cake, they have lots of cakes here and all tasting very fresh, Mmmmm. Once I had something like a pumpkin/carrot cake with the creamiest frosting that I put in a to go bag but ended up eating it before I even made it to the UBahn entrance which is literally 1min walk outside the door, haha.... I really love Scandinavian themed coffee shops or bistros, when I first moved to Hamburg, I frequented many of these shops around the city."
4,"This place is suburb!  We were trudging back to our hotel after 5 hours on our feet. We would have eaten anywhere!  I thought it was just going to be a run-of-the-mill cafe. It is so much more!  My husband had, what he now considers, one of the best dishes in his life!  He ordered a linguine with cherry tomatoes, onions, steak in a Parmesan cream sauce. I loved my dish also, pappardelle (obviously homemade) with crab and large shrimp in a saffron based sauce. Terrific!  Also they delivered a wonderful amuse bouche of a small bowl of a cauliflower soup that was fantastic.  This place is out if the way, but out of this world. ( it was around 44 euro for two entrees and two drinks)"
2,"Touristy, of course at this location. The menus were just kind of thrown on the table and the waiter walked away. He was very busy. Music playing so softly I couldn't even make out what kind of music was playing. Quite without atmosphere, this restaurant.Food was served quickly and tasted good. The waiter didn't come to check on us at any time though.Toilets not very clean, not dirty.. Something in the kitchen he middle. Free WiFi. I think that it's a good place to have a quick bite for a fair price close to the docks. Defiantly not a romantic place for a date!"
2,"Noah's is a nice enough little restaurant on Grosse Neumarkt, but it didn't seem special when I visited last night. When we went inside it was noticeable that we were the only guests there - Admittedly it was a Monday night, but still. The menu is small, which is fine, but the prices are quite a bit higher than the only other greek restaurant that I've been to in Hamburg, and sadly the food is worse On the up-side they're not too far from where I work and they have a competitively priced lunch menu, so I'll probably come back and try that sometime."
4,"Fresh, high quality seafood.  Intimate sitting for 30 fills the restaurant. Proprietor hands on, serves as host and translator. Backyard party atmosphere, expect to relax and enjoy for hours as late arrivers are served to catch up on the set 4 course meal. Vegetarian service also offered. Guitarist adds to atmosphere. Generous host served special shots as we joined in watching Germany win the FIFA WC! Arriba!"
3,"I have had many a doner in many a German city, but I am putting it out there - this is the best. I was guided here by a Turkish employee at my hotel, so I had high hopes. They were fulfilled. The meat is sliced fresh, and you have multiple meat choices. The flatbread is pressed and cooked fresh, meaning it's hot and delicious. There are many other choices too, from chicken wings to lamb. The restaurant itself has some tables and is a bit beat up, but fine. I subtract a star because you come out smelling like doner for a day thanks to all of the smoke and poor ventilation in the cooking area. But, it's worth it."
3,"Morden restaurant setting supported by self-service menu checking and ordering system. You can also design ur own burger (e.g. no tomato, with sesame bread, with extra beef and etc.).I ordered a chili burger with homemade basil lemonade. Pretty nice beef meat and very well made chili sauce! The food and drinks were also serviced fast. I would definitely like to come back again!"
4,"Really good street food very good Chana bhatura - pretty fast service it's always busy so give yourself some time to find a seat, but I totally recommend i."
1,"Haven't been able to taste the burger yet because we have been made waiting for 1h 20 minutes as for now. Basically the service ignored us, taking orders from anybody else around us which came AFTER us. Eventually we had to ask for menus. After 1h10m, when we decided to talk to the manager, he only put up a bunch of excuses. I can now count 6 tables that sat after us, ordered, ate, paid and left before we could even see our burgers...Oh and the drinks are room temperature warm.EDIT:Food eventually came and I have to admit it was really good, make sure you try the different homemade sauces and the fries."
2,"As a New Yorker, I had to try a hamburger in Hamburg.  Fast food taken to a higher level.  The decor was modern and stylish, with great music and no paper/styrofoam here, real plates and flatware.The burger was good, not great or memorable, as were the sides.  Overall, a good experience and much better than any fast food alternative.  If you are looking for a quick, yet stylish, burger meal, this is a must try."
4,"I'm a massive fan of the Stadtpark, and now summer is just around the corner, I'm inspired to tell you why. For a decent program, I'd highly recommend renting a canoe and paddling your way through the canal network into the Stadtparksee, where you can promptly jump in (without paying!) and swim to shore. Then unload your picnic, beers and size 6 cricket set, and a happy afternoon will be had by all. It's advisable to use a windball instead of the real thing, lest you kill a baby and put a dampener on everything."
4,"I was on a free walking tour of Hamburg, and was brought to this area. And that's what it is. An area of old warehouses, many of which played a key role in the economic development of this city and country.The place is really photogenic. I was surprised at how many photos I wanted to take. The network of canals flowing between the warehouses create some wonderful photo ops, and it was also interesting to learn about the history of the buildings. I would recommend taking one of the free walking tours for this reason.The Miniatur Wunderland is in the area, so that's another reason to check it out. See my review of that for more info!"
3,"Just went to Kardelen with a bunch of people from the office. I was told that no-one had reviewed it because no-one could ever remember it's name. Well it wasn't even listed in Qype! As it happens I also forgot the name, but clever me took a photo ;) Anyway I had a chicken doner plate (it came with rice and salad and sauce). It cost EUR5.50 and also came with free bread and tea! It was pretty huge (see photos) but I was pretty hungry and so polished it off... I'd definitely go back again."
4,Exquisite service! Super interior. Love their salted popcorn as nice welcome. Had sushi at this place and loved it! Also tried their sweet potato fries with guac but the guac was a bit too watery for my taste. All in all a really nice place to stop by after shopping. Thumbs up for the great staff!
4,"A newcomer on Hamburg Irish bar scene: there have been a few already and this one looks promissing too!Wonderful interior, lots of green of course (you can't skeep that) friendly service, beer and other drinks. And yes, they speak English!The highlight for me is karaoke, which they want to do regularly. Also wiskey tasting is another event they host.Let's see what comes next. Irish dance evenings perhaps?"
4,"If you're looking for traditional northern German food, Brodersen is definitely a good spot! The interior is also traditional and cozy with a nautical theme. The Pannfisch with the Dijon mustard sauce was quite good, and my partner also really enjoyed the Rumpsteak. I think the highlight was however the Bratkartoffeln... crispy yet soft and fried to perfection! Not the cheapest restaurant but for special occasions definitely a good option! Good for tourists visiting hamburg as well."
4,"I wasn't entirely impressed by Mr. Kebab the first time I went, but for some reason, my second visit was the one which had me sold. The three of us ordered an ""enlarged grill Teller"" (see photos) which ended up including an insane amount of meat on a plate (it was about 30eu). How we managed to finish all of it is still somewhat of a mystery (how we managed to fit beer in afterwards is even more of a mystery), but we came out of Mr. Kebab in a blissful, beefy haze. The meat at Mr, Kebab, as I mentioned, is excellent. Well prepared and a rich menu assortment (a menu which includes many ridiculous and nonsensical bits of Engrish). The service is very friendly and the prices are extremely fair. The bathrooms are a little trippy. If this would be my only advice to you, make sure you visit the toilets before you down 3 liters of beer, and not after. You'll thank me later."
3,"Even without trying any other dim sum restaurants in Hamburg, I'm pretty sure Mei Moon will be our go-to place for dim sum. The hubby and I stopped in after an afternoon of shopping, so we were famished. It was barely 6pm, so I'd like to think we avoided the dinner crowd. The restaurant, though down a small, alley-like street, was not hard to find. You can't miss the red signage. Mei Moon wouldn't be a true Chinese restaurant if they didn't have a giant menu, and this they did have indeed. We stuck with just the dim sum menu and already that was about 40+ items. We ordered 7 items, all of which were super tasty.My favorites included:- Rice roll with BBQ pork- Shark fin dumplings- Prawn dumpling with leeksProbably one of the best parts about the meal was the chili oil. Seriously. It was spicy as heck and very fragrant. Very different, in a good way, than the chili oil I've had at home in SF.Service was friendly, food came out pretty fast and pricing is pretty on par with dim sum places in SF. We look forward to coming back to try the other non-dim-sum offerings."
3,"Was very pleasantly surprised by this place. A friend invited me here for lunch having eaten here before. I was expecting bland kiosk style food. It turned out to be really good and the portions are solid. They have a ""Mittagskarte"" which makes everything affordable if you come during the day. I've not yet eaten dinner here but I presume it fills up fast. Service is always polite...have now been here a couple times and food tends to come out fairly quickly. It's also nice to sit outside if the weather allows for it but there aren't that many tables...as is the case with most places on the Lange Reihe."
4,"If you like great handmade pizza in 10 minutes, this is a place to check out. They have a creative weekly offering of different pizzas (even vegan and sweet options) are available. The staff is nice and the prices are fair for the central location."
4,"The best cup of coffee I had in Germany, and possibly ever, came from this lovely little cramped coffee house we spotted on our way back to the train after a full day of exploring Hamburg. We were desperate to acclimate to the time change and coffee sounded like just the ticket, so we stopped in and ordered a highly caffeinated round of deliciousness. I ordered a flat white and a chocolate torte (I actually received a pomegranate cheesecake type treat, which is likely 20% due to the staggeringly loud atmosphere and 80% due to me not speaking a single word of German!), but I still enjoyed it. The coffee was the crowning glory of our stop - rich, strong, perfectly poured and capped with a layer of foam decorated with a pretty little heart. I wanted to try to get back here before heading back to the states, but it was just far enough away from where we were staying that I couldn't swing it. I will dream about that delightful flat white, however, and if I ever return, this will be at the top of my list."
3,"Who here shortly after the opening appears, actually always finds a place. That changes completely fast, at the latest if the conception is terminated in the nearby theatre, becomes it here very much full, then one has sometimes the impression the kitchen is something overtaxed (can last already times longer). But for a really good meal first you have tu find the place. No sign points the way to us. One must belong to the insider. The village is accommodated a wine tube, in a cellar, with a remarkably variedly bill of fare."
3,"Finally, Turkish food that's not döner!We had to go to Ikea and instead of having Swedish meatballs like we always do when we go to Ikea, we decided to venture out a bit. With a little help from Yelp, we found Köz Urfa. I'm thinking I will find more occasions to go to Ikea now because of this delightful Turkish restaurant. This restaurant is HUGE! And there's a cave area for more intimate dining. We arrived a little after 5pm, so the place wasn't very full up. The various kebaps are neatly displayed in large refrigerated glass cases. The dining room was bright and clean, and the staff is super inviting and friendly.I ordered the Urfa kebap while the hubby ordered the Adana kebap. I believe the difference was his was spicy and mine was not. For 11€ per plate, you get a lot of food. The meat is laid on top of a half and half bulgar and rice. You also get like 5 different sides and some grilled veggies, as well as a side of flatbread. I was not able to finish my plate, but I guess next time I'll come hungrier.I'm very much looking forward to coming back. There are so many dishes to try, plus all the dessert!"
2,"A slightly underwhelming experience for my birthday dinner. This restaurant is very close to my apartment and I was very much looking forward to being able to go there often.The amuse-bouche was amazing: A garlic soup (velouté) which tasted absolutely divine. The taste of garlic, while definitely present, was mild and enjoyable. I'm glad it came only in small espresso cups because it felt very rich.The appetizer (veal pâté with a gorgonzola mousse) was also very good. The gorgonzola mousse on top of arugula was really tasty. The pâté had also good taste but I wished that it was a little bit richer. It felt a little bit dry, but this is probably normal when you consider that it's not pork-based pâté. Also strange was that my course was served without bread.The main course is where the disappointment happened. Both my wife and I had the cod served with spinach and seafood cannelloni. The skin of the fish wasn't crispy and the spinach was underwhelming. But worst of all were the two seafood cannelloni. Whoever made these should not be allowed to cook pasta again, it was really tough and I ended up leaving on the plate. Same with my wife and my neighbor at a different table. Overall this dish had potential but the execution was poor.Service was incredibly slow. The three first courses arrived at a good pace, not fast but it left time for us to enjoy the food, wine and conversation. But once we received our main courses, the waiters just seemed to disappear. We waited so long that in the end we decided to bypass the dessert and head home, because we didn't want to wait any longer. In the end, 3 courses took more than 2 hours."
3,"I like that cafe. They have good food, the service is nice, you can sit outside and the prices are decent. They also have a good breakfast with huge rolls. The last time we came here we had the panino turkey arugula and the chicken with mashed potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and loads of hollandaise sauce. So good!:) Both. Also the neighborhood is great, alternative, cool stores... Love the 'Schanze'."
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining as Ernst wrote. The food is mediocre at best. There is nothing sensational on the menu. Nor is there anything in any way memorable. All fairly standard fare. Sometimes things are good. Sometimes they are off. The place is not consistent. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow. I couldn't even tell what it was. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table."
3,"The location is not suitable for finding this restaurant ""just by walking"". The interior is not something you want if you do fine dining. But the steaks and burgers are just awesome. They take the meat business very seriously. I mean VERY. Guaranteed you do not leave hungry from this place.For casual dinner with friends who like burgers and steaks, this is a must place to test. Keep in mind, that they accept cash only, no credit cards, so prepare yourself with cash when you arrive. The prices are not too high, but due to meat coming form USA, it is more expensive than normal restaurants serving meat."
4,"Do not let the cheap prices misguide you. You'll be getting premium stakes here !!!I ordere rib-eye 300 he and my god what a beauty. The searing and crust was great, the seasoning was really good and the meat had a nice marbleIng too. The side dishes were also nice but honestly I was here for a good steak and I got one."
3,Good food and good shots. Be prepared because you can end up drunk just before starting with the free shots the friendly waiters pour for you!
0,"Expensive for what it is: our dishes were not well cooked, the quantity served was too little and the recipies were not really ""elaborate"". My advice: do not stop by this restaurant, you'll find many more interesting ones in the same neighbourhood."
3,"Got here close to when they opened and one of the wait staff members informed me that the kitchen was still preparing and that I couldn't order just yet but I was welcome to wait in the restaurant.I didn't mind the wait and everyone was very nice. After about 20 or 30 min, the waitress came by and took my order and my noodle soup came out at a reasonable time. An hour past after they opened and I could tell this is a popular lunch spot as the place was filling up very quickly so be here to get here early to avoid the lunch rush.The menu changes frequently and while they do have a menu with some staples, seems like everyone is looking at their specials board that changes everyday I believe. I ordered off the specials board - noodle soup.The noodle soup was really great! Had a lot of great flavors and on a cold day, this helped to warm me up! I love the vibe of this place! The staff is super friendly and they have a great lunch selection that will please your taste buds.I will be sure to come back to try more!"
2,"Here is a steakhouse that looks great, has outstanding servers and a friendly happy vibe. But the food tastes pushed... The premium T bone was a delicious steak that was really tender. And, it was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request. The issue? 4! Count them--four 6 inch sprigs of fresh Rosemary on the hot plate under the steak overwhelming it with herby fumes! 1 would have sufficed! Four is enough to offend and halt an angry Water Buffalo at full waddle.Then the green beans were cooked squishy and had heavy butter. What happened to steaming so there is still a firm bite? And the steak sauce was an odd concoction of tomato cocktail sauce with onions??? For my premium steak? A horseradish Mayo with steak drippings would have been more interesting for a house steak sauce...The fries? Perfect.The 500g T bone (porterhouse actually with giant filet lobe) was a generous portion.The server crew oozed warm hospitality--bravo. The kitchen crew looked depressed. Maybe they knew that I would not enjoy my steak"
3,Recommended for high ambiance and good food.
4,"This venue is really cool. I've been there three times and I always listened to some good music. The place is unbelievably small, the smallest venue I've ever been to, and the first time I was there I wondered how they could do gigs in there. But the atmosphere there is great and people is there to listen to music. If you want to discover and listen to some underground, mostly German, artists that you've probably never heard of that is definitely the best spot in Hamburg I know so far."
3,"Chouette endroit en effet, la rue est jolie, une clientèle brassée et ma foi sympathique, service gentil, bons cocktails quand le barman est là et bonne surprise chaque fois : les prix sont très modérés. Mon chouchou : les pizzas sont excellentes, vous savez, celles avec des ingrédients frais et à pate fine. C'est simple, je ne mange jamais de pizza en dehors de chez moi, exception faite pour Gloria. Ce soir sur la carte, une pizza chèvre miel et poire, un délice! Sinon la Rucola Parma Schinken, très bonne aussi. Tables en terrasse toujours bondées à partir de 15 degrés ;-) c'est typique de Hambourg! De toutes façons, on est mieux assis à l'intérieur."
4,"I came here for lunch around midday and there was plenty of space to sit as a group. Ordering through the tablets built into the table was novel but not perfect; I wanted the chili burger without cheese but the software didn't give me the option to take the cheese off. No big deal, I went with the Burgerlich burger instead. It was pretty good, although the brioche bun was a little sweet for me. I got a side of fries as well, which came with an excellent BBQ sauce (word of warning: the menu calls it 'Bullseye Sauce'. No idea why; maybe because it hits the spot?). The whole meal cost just under €8 and they gave out free apples on the way out, which was a nice touch.Good lunch spot and burger joint. I'll be back.Side note: if you're from the UK, this place is very similar to Byron."
3,"Danmark Snack is basically just hotdogs and burgers, but mostly hotdogs. It's a very unassuming little place, and so for the past year I'd always just walked on by to one of the other fast-food places. I had noticed that it's well reviewed here by German Qypers, and so when leaving the Reeperbahn S-Bahn hungry last night I popped in. The place is basically a hotdog factory, but they also have a few burgers if you want one of those. I went for a cheeseburger and it hit the spot. Not too big, not too small. it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was better than most of what is on offer at other nearby establishments."
0,"The building and the menu led us to Wasserschloss.  Made a reservation.  They didn't have the reservation but they made room for us.  That's when it all went badly.  Our server forgot to bring us bread, forgot to bring us wine, forgot to check on us once, and was surprised that we wanted the check so soon.  Terrible service ruined what could have been a great night to remember.  Stay away unless you want ok food with bland memories."
3,"Kardelen is an affordable Turkish place with dozens of solid meat and vegetarian options. The food tastes fresh, and there are daily vegetarian and meat options posted on a blackboard outside and showcased before the cash register behind a glass counter.I recommend the gemüseteller mit döner, which is aubergines, cauliflower, couscous, two falafel balls, yogurt sauce, and chicken or beef with a small side salad for 6.50€.The food here overall isn't amazing, but it's tasty and certainly worth the low costs. I've had a lot better döner kebab and falafel in Hamburg, but this is still a place I recommend for lunch if you're in the area."
3,"Came here with my wife on a Wednesday night, and we were surprised by the 20 minute queue.  From the smells going around, we can understand why.It's a small space that is stylishly designed reminding of Ramen houses we've been to in Vancouver, BC.  We ordered the katsu don which was a little greasy and on the large side, but it was still crispy.  My wife had the special shio ramen, and I had the special miso ramen.  The shio ramen stock was much lighter than we were used to, but it was good after cracking the tamago and mixing around the yolk.  The miso ramen was fantastic.  Great creamy broth and a little spicy. Is it the best ramen restaurant I've been to?  I would say no, since we've been to ones in London, Seattle, and Vancouver.  For having this place in Hamburg, it's the most authentic thing I've had in a long time.  Big plus that the servers speak Japanese.  We're adding this to our monthly rotation of restaurants for sure."
4,"Neapolitan Pizza, how it is supposed to taste. :)The interior is more spacious than it seems from the outside; comfortable, but no setting for a cozy night out or so (Ottensen's 'Farina meets Mehl' is more pricey, but better in that respect).But the value for lunch is excellent here at €7 for a Margherita and a water, a little more for buffalo mozzarella. Not aware that any of the other Neapolitan places even comes close (well, Schanze's Pizza Jill is good at lunch, too).Will be back and will bring the kids."
4,The best pizza in St. Pauli is clearly made by Pauli Pizza.At this tiny little spot near Reeperbahn you can create your own pizza by choosing your fave ingredients off the menu. Distinguish between sizes small and normal.Thankfully everyone even on a budget will get fed there for little money. The prices are low and the pizzas are great all the same. Whatta treat!The chatty staff are funny guys very willing to help you out if you don't know what else to top up the base with. I recommend this down-to-earth place at any hour of the day :)
3,The food quality is good. kebab is authentic.servers could do a better job.
4,"Short version: I love eating at Dean & DavidLong version: I am the biggest lover of meat and cheese so when My doctor said I needed to change my diet I was Glum, I thought you couldn't get nice food that was not full crap.  My girlfriend and I started looking for nice places that were a bit healthier and Dean & David hits the mark perfectly.I am a major fan of the Warm Thai Beef Salad and my girlfriend particularly likes the Parisian Salad, both of us are working through the juices and I am a particular fan of the Ginger Shot although it is not quite as tangy as the ginger juices we make at home.It is very helpful that this store is just round the corner from my work for grabbing something quick but seating space is a little short here and for that reason I prefer here when passing or grabbing a quick something but the one on Georgsplatz 10 when we will sit a while and take our time to eat."
4,"This place is so cute and so cozy! Not to mention the food is fantastic, for vegans and non-vegans alike!The staff is also very friendly and accommodating."
3,"The ambience is very nice, but the food is a bit bland, compared to other vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. But everything is very fresh and nicely served. On Saturday at lunch the place was crowded, people were even waiting outside to get a seat."
4,Super toller Strand!
3,High end steak house with good steaks from various countries and nice wines...though I personally feel they overpriced the California wines (I am from the US and know the California wine prices in the US).  Atmosphere is high end.  Interior is clean and nice.  Prices are high but worth the overall experience. Just don't buy the Cali wines.
3,"Met a good friend here for a coffee. It was Sunday and packed and rightly so! The coffee was very good and the atmosphere was very nice, not quite what I expected from the area. I did not try any of their food offerings, but the nice man next to me seemed to truly enjoy his chocolate cake. I also noticed that they had a Brunch Bar out, and that families were helping themselves to the emptying selection (it was after 13:00). Looking forward to my next time back! Check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"Hier gibt es das perfekte Mittagessen: tolle Salate mit Ziegenkäse und exzellentem Dressing. Außerdem abwechslungsreiche Nudelgerichte. Beides auf Wunsch als 50:50 Gericht.Qualität sehr gut, Preis leicht gehoben im Vergleich zum üblichen Mittagstisch. Einziges Manko: Restaurant Schecks wie Sodexo werden nicht angenommen!"
3,"Moraba is a nice bar in the schanze. Not particularly special, but certainly gets most things right. I guess the reason that I'm so blasé is because after you've been to one, you've sort of been to most of the bars in the area - they are all good, but not many stand out."
4,"Food was great, didn't have to wait for long till the food came, waitress was super friendly! Loved it and highly recommended this Vietnamese restaurant :)"
2,"If you need to satisfy your greasy Chinese food cravings this is def the place to come to. Over priced Chinese food with an ambiance that makes you feel like you in the movie rush hour. The food is just ok, fairly fresh. Unfortunately I ordered from the English menu which didn't really explain the dishes very well so ask your server to clarify!"
2,"Die Lage ist super, der Service ziemlich flott, fast zu schnell. Das Früstück ist lecker aber auch etwas teurer. Ich delber hatte einen Grupon Gutschein (11EUR) über ein Frühstück (wert 22EUR), dies war zwar ok, jedoch auch nur die 11EUR wert, keinesfalls 22EUR. Zudem blieb es so nah auf dem Wasser nicht aus das div. keine Insekten herumschwirrten und sich auf dem Obst, der Wurst oder im Kaffee/ O-Saft niedergelassen haben."
0,"Very disappointing! I am German and I am used to quite a bit of bad service but this was a new level of rudeness. I could go into details about our stay there, yesterday, but I will just leave it to some examples: We were 8 persons, after taking the orders of 5 of us, the waitress lost interest and started fo collect the menus so I had to insist to get my order and those of my kids to her, too. Later they brought the wrong cakes for two of us (taking notes sometimes makes sense!) and kind of blamed us for it. We eventually took that cake to avoid a scene but it didn't taste very good. We were never asked if we want more coffee or drinks, the Apfelschorle I had wasn't really cold (it had almost 40C outside) and ice cubes seem to be unknown to them. When a motorcycle parade passed the restaurant, they refused to close the door, so we couldn't have a conversation for 15+ minutes due to the noise. I could go on but just want to add at this point that the place wasn't packed. In fact it was quite empty. I do not recommend this Schönes Leben."
3,"Ach, das gute alte Meyer Lansky's- immer eine sichere Sache. Ich muss sagen, dass ich den Service hier immer durch die Bank weg erstaunlich gut finde. Die bieten dir schon einen neuen Drink an, wenn der alte noch nicht ganz aufgetrunken ist...naja, ist vielleicht manchmal gar nicht schlecht, wenn es mal ne kurze Pause zwischendurch gibt ;) Hilfsbereit, wenn man an einen anderen Tisch umziehen will und den Cocktail bekommt man noch zu Happy Hour Preisen, wenn man ihn vor dem Ende der Zeit schon mal reserviert hat. 1 A. Toiletten sind auch zu später Stunde noch völlig ok. Was ich allerdings richtig schrecklich finde, ist, dass man in dem Laden rauchen darf. Schade!"
0,"Really bad cappuccino. We got a quiche each which was served with salad. In my opinion it was overpriced and not tasty.We went there because of the excellent reviews this place got, but i really dont see why this is ranked as one of the best brunch places in Hamburg. Not recommended"
3,"Good service, good goulash and great location. Would recommend! We definitely will be coming back."
2,I was a bit disappointed by the breakfast on offer but the cakes were good. Coffee not so good. Very nice mood though and lovely interiors.
4,It's exactly what I needed. Pancakes with a lot of syrup. It was everything I could have wished for this morning.
3,A pretty good Indian restaurant considering it's in Hamburg. Handy location right by Mundsberg station on the U3 line.
4,"I came all the way from Houston Texas, which has a very large Vietnamese population, to taste some of the best Pho I have ever had. I recommend the Pho with chicken and meatballs. If noodle soup is not your thing then try the Vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken. I actually started an account on Qype because of this place! Lecker Lecker!"
4,"You know, I really didn't know that Hamburg is a Hamburger place so when we randomly googled and found this out, I knew I had to find a solid burger to enjoy while I was here! A quick yelp search brings up this place which was close to my hostel in Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and boy did the yelpers NOT disappoint! Unfortunately the infamous Lumper Jack wasn't on the menu but there's a ton of other options available. We came around 17:00 and it was empty--we almost hesitated going in but in the end, we were tired, hungry, and put all our trust in good reviews.My friend initially really wanted NOT a burger so if you're going for something besides a burger, they have like chicken fingers, a salad (yes, just one) and fish and chips. Also, if you're a vegetarian, there's a bunch of solid options on that end too. I couldn't decide from the loads of options, everything sounded amazing but in the end, I splurged for the Truffle Burger (7,90€)  and added an extra side of bacon (+1€). I also made it a meal by adding fries and a drink (3,90€ - choice of bottled beverages from waters to sodas to juices/lemonades to beer). My friend ended up getting the jalapeno burger (6,90€ i think?) with the meal as well.Our food came out pretty quickly and it was HUGE and honestly looked so delicious I barely got the plate and already started stuffing my face. I didn't even realize that they forgot the bacon at first until my friend realized they forgot to add it to hers too so we mentioned it and the chefs added it to the burgers. Holy moly, this burger is banging. The brioche bun has almost a pretzel-y flavor, almost smokey or whatever it is that makes pretzels get that rich brown colour. The burger was cooked a perfect medium (though I usually go for rare) and it was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The fillings were fresh, though the truffle flavor wasn't super present--the bacon really added another dimension of smokiness and honestly it was so good I had a hard time putting it down. The fries were really good too! Crispy but tons of solid potato flavor. When we paid, they asked if we wanted ketchup or mayonnaise but I wasn't sure if it was extra and decided against it. The fries honestly didn't need any sauce but if you want something additional, they do have choluha (reg, green, chipotle) and oil/vinegar. The beer was also very refreshing, and produced in hamburg which was pretty nice!The place is a order @ the counter, buzzer, seat yourself kind of place and is super clean with really nice bathrooms. The staff was really friendly and honestly, this place really was a winner! I don't know what people are talking about in terms of sports bar (?) but it just felt like a nice casual burger place. Definitely recommend!! So good and so glad I stopped in :)"
4,a great taste of home with american style breakfast complete with excellent veggie sausage. good pancakes too!
0,"We have been here for breakfast, but it was the first and last time! We had to wait a long time for our coffee and over 1h for a breakfast!! I had the vegan breakfast, because I was looking forward to the peanut butter. But it came without it. After asking they mentioned they don't have it anymore! Would have been nice to communicate it before because I was choosing the this breakfast because of the peanut butter! The quality of the food was okay, but nothing special and I had to peel the avocado and banana by myself. In the end the bill was 28€ which is not cheap for a breakfast and because of our issues I don't wanted to give a tip. And he just kept my 30€!!! I will never go there again!"
4,"A 5-star Flat White was what I was after...And a 5-star Flat White is what I got. An esteemed colleague of mine suggest Public Coffee Roasters as a (much needed) departure from chains Starbucks, Balzac, etc. She was undeniably correct, Public Coffee Roasters was a nice walk for us (fresh air!) and ended up being lovely (fresh coffee!). The guy behind the counter was very courteous and made that flat white with an expert touch. Upon delivering it to our table he even apologized for the (nonexistent!) delay. It's a chill spot with a few tables, comfortable vibe, nice music, friendly staff and great coffee. Hits all the notes for me."
4,"People had been telling me that this place does the best Turkish food in Hamburg for years  basically ever since I lived in Hamburg. Last Friday I finally remembered to check it out, and boy was I glad that I did! Two of us arrived at about 8pm on a Friday. There were already about 10 people waiting for tables, but we were seated within 10 minutes. The service was pleasant and quick, but it's worth noting that they do not serve any alcohol here. What they do serve is meat! Basically everything on the menu and everything that I saw being delivered to tables looked amazing. The kebab plate that I ordered (I forget the name, sadly) was huge and very tasty, but my companion's lamb kebab was even better. I will be back to try more of the menu, and I'll be bringing more friends!"
4,"A really nice little restaurant with high end cuisine. Friendly and relaxed with superb food. I chose the surprise menu, since i couldnt decide which of the delicies to pick. Super friendly waitress, and a dedicated chef who several times came to the table himself. Not overprised at all, and well worth the visit."
3,"Really nice bar in the middle of Schanze, with really nice bartenders and good cocktails. It usually becomes very crowded at around 10 or 11. Plus they've got an almost hidden table football that ends up being one of the distinctive reasons to go there and have fun challenging friends."
3,"In a one week business trip to Hamburg, I ate green lovers four times: once with a coworker, once as catering for a team meeting, and twice on my own. So I guess you could say I'm a fan of this place! And I'm clearly not the only fan, as there was a lunch line every time I visited (various times between noon and 1:30). But not to worry, the line moves quite fast and you'll be eating lunch before you know it.There are various salad and soup options available, or you can create a custom salad by pointing at ingredients at the counter. I quickly learned how to say the various parts of my order in German (mixed salad, egg, beans, corn, mushrooms, tomato, parmesan cheese, balsamic dressing), though most of the staff is pretty fluent in English. Visiting from SF where a custom lunch salad can easily cost $14, the prices here (around 5-8 euros for a custom salad, depending on what you put in it) seem very reasonable.There's some indoor seating but it's pretty packed at lunch, so you may want to plan to take your meal elsewhere. Though if you do manage to get a seat and are dining alone, not to worry, they have free wi-fi!Healthy, fresh, fast, and reasonably priced, this is a great antidote to the heaviness and grease typically associated with German food."
1,"After having ordered my burger, I almost had to wait for one (!) hour. After about 40 minutes, I enquired into the reasons for the delay and I was told, that there was a huge backlog of orders...Mhmm. Also: EC-Card payments available only for amounts above 15€. No credit cards accepted! Wouldn't consider it a pleasant costumer experience."
2,"I was positively surprised by the many different dishes you can order, even though sometimes further detailed descriptions may help you figuring out what to eat. Waiters were friendly, what actually persuaded me into rating three stars is the fact that portions are a bit disappointing in terms of quantity and that people were loud, also payment with cash card is not supported, anyway i'm definitely going again! Dishes tasted really good."
4,Great Vietnamese street food style restaurant with a cool vibe! Definitely try the Vietnamese ice coffee. Ask for the spicy vinegar if you need a bit more tang. Recommended!
4,Great location! I was there for the first time and the coffee is very delicious! Nice staff!
1,"It is sushi and Asian fusion in Germany.  Do I need to say much more?  One of my Hamburg colleagues planned an outing for us here for dinner.  It's clubby atmosphere with the loud music, red and mod decor will get you in the mood for a raging good time.  However, I was jetlagged with well over 24 hours of no sleep.  The menu blended sushi, other Japanese dishes and Thai food.  I didn't want to seem like the pooper, so I let the group go with what they wanted.  Also, I am very skeptical of Asian restaurants abroad.  So we shared one of the sushi boat assortments and an assortment of skewers.  Rolls and skewers were average, lots covered in sauce.  I'm alway skeptical when rolls and everything are drenched in sauce.  The fried tuna one was a little on the fishy side.  Our waiter was trying to offer some recommendations but I felt that he wasn't too helpful to help indecisive first timers.  We ended up paying about 27 Euro each to share the two appetizers platter and our respective drinks.I'd say hunt around for better Asian food elsewhere."
4,"Yum!One of the better values since I've been in Hamburg. I got the Schweinebraten (roast pork. DAT SKIN DOE.), mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut. You can either get a small or large portion, though there wasn't too big of a difference between the two. The small seems to be good enough. They spoke English here. :)DAS GOOT."
2,"There are more authentic Lebanese/Syrian restaurants in Hamburg. The guys made quite an effort so it's a little bit of a heartbreaker to give them three stars, but it is what it is.The main problem is, that the food really lacks authenticity and yet it comes at a quite high price for what it is. Please trust me on this one I have travelled the entire Middle East and I know what their cuisine is like. As a real Hamburg Docker I'll give you a heads up and recommend looking for another Syrian/Lebanese place to eat."
3,"A respectable wine bar. It's not exactly my style, I prefer my wine bars with a bit more flourish and character. If you like the warehouse aesthetic, then this place is for you. The selection was great, the prices weren't too crazy, and the food was delicious. 4/5."
4,"Great steak place, in my mind comparable to Outback Steakhouse, if not better.  A chain, but great quality none the less.  If you're looking for a good American style steak in Germany, this is the place!  Their homemade sour cream tastes incredible, also.  Dog and kid friendly."
4,Nice spot on the Alster! Was here to enjoy the sun and this location is fantastic... It is without service but associates are friendly and they as well offer food (BBQ) when the weather is good. The prices are fair and you can rent boats etc if you are up for it.
3,"Yum! Quick, easy, and filling. I got the first lamb dish on the menu and it was great. They don't have enough seating for their demand, so people come and wait around looking for seats all the time. It's a little bit fast-food like, actually. But the food is simple and tasty. Comes with naan and rice and yogurt (+ salad and a soup kinda thing) for a great price."
2,"We went to Le Xich Lo for a late Friday lunch.. I had high hopes for this place because I enjoy food from the region and always prefer authentic restaurants.The waitress was not at all friendly. It was quite obvious that she'd rather have a short of break at this time than serve us. I even had to reason with her why I would like to have some more chili sauce.The food wasn't really a highlight either. The soup was luke warm at best and tested boring. For a national dish I'd expected a bit more. As a starter I tried frog legs which weren't impressive either. They were totally over-seasoned and chewy. The 3 stars are for the Mango Curry my wife had, that was actually very tasty. The only plus for this place."
2,"On a 5 minute walk from the central station I found this Thai/Japanese restaurant. Small, but cosy. Restaurant entourage was sparse, not that many oriental stuff on the walls like you see in so many other Asian restaurants. Light is semi bright, you can actually see what your eating... (and who your talking to)The Japanese Asai beer on the menu was not available, had to revert to Kirin (also ok!).Tried Sashimi moriawase (mixed raw fish) for starters and a hot Thai beef curry as main course.It took a considerable amount of time to serve the starting course. The Sashimi was almost worth the wait, very tasty fish indeed. The surimi sticks could have been replaced by some other fresh fish (not so very original..).Only the wasabi was not as spicy and hot as I hoped for.The main course, curry beef, was exactly what I hoped for. Very hot and tasty! Albeit that the beef was a little overcooked and hence not that tender as it could have been. All in all a okay experience, but not so excellent as other reviewers indicated."
4,"A friend recommended that bistro so I had to try it out. They not only a wide variety of Galettes, they also have a nice selection of wines. My friend had a Galette with Gorgonzola and I had a Galette Begerre. The only bad thing was that some of the walnuts had to much of caramelized sugar but beside that it was very delicious and the perfect mix between savory and sweet.Highly recommended for good Galettes!"
3,"Spacious cafe & roastery in the same development as the Ratsherrn brewery, which seems to be well placed for getting the sun throughout the day.Service was good & the coffees and cake were equally good and well sized. Someone more discerning with their coffee drinking than me could no doubt delineate between good or bad but I'm more concerned with size & temperature of the drink when it reaches me and both were up to scratch."
1,"The food was amazing. And it's such a cosy venue.The service, however, was pretty bad. Our waitress tried very hard, and was very friendly. But:- Apparently the person showing guests the tables was new, and she sent everyone to tables serviced by the same waitress.- As a result, every time we wanted to order drinks or food, it took ages to order, and even longer to arrive.- After waiting an hour for our food, it turned out the kitchen lost our order (and of the table next to us), and we had to wait ages again for our food. Not sure the good food outweighted the huge wait."
4,"This place was great. I kinda had a mini overload. Fun for all ages young and old. The pieces they have are of historical, modern and imaginative. I'm  from Los Angeles California, and went to Hamburg for business. On a day I had off I came across this great gem of a tourist destination. I would like to come back and see new displays they come up with."
4,"Einfach TOLL !The food is great, the prices are really correct, the place is lovely and the service is perfect !Nothing to add but GO and enjoy :) !"
3,"I heard its owned by the owner of gold fisch glass! I wasn't surprised, almost same crowd. It was semi-full on tuesday evening.You can either sit inside or outsideBeer isn't expensive 2EUR20 for a becks (if i am not mistaken)Good place for a drink on week night."
3,"The place is small and luckily we had a reservation, because it was very full (friday evening). In the end they even sent people away because there was no more food. However, the burgers were big and delicious. I had a vegan Burger with sweetpotatoe fries, both very good. We didn't have to wait long for the food and even though there was a lot going on, the waitress was really kind and not stressed. We felt very comfortable. Last but not least, prices are absolute appropriate!"
3,Nice restaurant in a distinguished area of Hamburg center. Persian cuisine is well-known for its savoury dishes. Its worth the visit to enjoy the main course and their appetisers.
4,"This restaurant was a great and random find. The food was tasty and the service friendly; OK, so my borther and I were the only customers in there, but as we were looking for something good open a little late, this was amazing !!! Highly recommended !!!"
4,"I came here on a recommendation by a friend that this was the best coffee in townI now wholeheartedly agree! The latte was so excellent, it made a Starbucks creation seem like a gas station cup of joe in comparison. Moreover, the chocolate chip cookie was the closest I've had to American style in Germany (although heating it up a tad wouldn't have hurt.) It's a small and cozy place, and rather quiet, which had a drawback: I had the unfortunate experience of encountering elderly clientele there who were reading newspapers and thus thought it was perfectly appropriate to ask fellow coffee drinkers to remain silent due to this. I can only hope they had gotten lost on their way to the library. Nevertheless, I can't blame the shop! A+ coffee here, even if just for a delicious to-go cup."
3,"No, not like Duff Beer, it's Dulf's Burger! This joint serves up some amazing meat between buns utilizing a high tech ordering system that you will have to experience yourself. It'll be one of those times where you just wish every restaurant had this system that just makes things easier.I went big with my burger and ordered a special that had everything. I'm talking fried egg, avocado, etc. While it was damn delicious (see the cross section photo I posted), I sort of wish I just went with a straight up cheeseburger to bask in the glory of simple hamburger in Hamburg. The onion rings were good, but I think I would rather have went with the fries.I do think Burgerlich is better than Dulf's, but both are real good in their own ways. Check out both of them while you're in town!"
4,This restaurant has lots of vegan choices which are delightful and the service is always friendly! It's a restaurant I always love coming back to!
4,"Excellent location, cheap and delicious fast food. Atmosphere is great, and the guys who work there are really personable. I've become a regular. :)"
4,"It is, in fact, as good as they say it is. After hearing for years about how great the bread in Germany is, I've been disappointed now that I actually live here. All of the bakeries seem to churn out the same crappy, lifeless, factory-made bread (and/or pastry). Not so at this bakery.I happened upon Die Kleine Konditorei by happenstance; my mechanic is nearby, and I needed something to do for 30 minutes while they worked on my car. They pointed me here, and I will be forever grateful.I was surprised at first to see a line out the door when I arrived on a random Tuesday morning. In my experience, Germans don't queue for anything, so this must be a good spot. I tried the most German croissant I could find... a sunflower seed pretzel croissant, and it was amazing. I also had a tiny little cheese/bacon puff that looked good (and was).Anyway, delicious baked goods, good prices, long lines. Seems worth it to me. I'll be back."
4,this place is great! good fresh pizza made fast with whatever toppings you want. and it's totally cheap too. i found my pizza joint
4,"We had a family lunch. The place is nice and food is good and tasty. A lot of German dishes, a bit heavy on condiments but this is my personal taste as I am not originally from Germany. We had a salmon burger, two regular burgers and a fish on a potatoes bed. Nice and fast service"
4,"What an awesome spot to sit and have a meal or just a drink or coffee/water on a nice day! An especially great spot to stop if you're cycling around the lake. Good prices, decent food, friendly service, but most of all the vibe can't be beat. Totally cool to be out there on the water. Like hanging out on a boat without the rocking. Clean bathrooms, too!"
3,"Ate here when the vegan restaurant Froindlich was too full and they recommended Xich Lô. There were plenty of vegan options and I loved the red curry. Another table nearby ordered something interesting with dry ice coming from the meal-- looked amazing. -1 star because the still water was not my favorite. I think it has a lot of minerals so it might be healthier, but it just tasted really bad to me. Also the dessert portion was a bit small.  Overall a wonderful spot, fast service and would recommend for vegans."
4,I ordered flat white and I must say that I've never before had such a good coffee. Might consider moving my home office here :-)
0,"Watch out, they close at random times. After a long slog through the cold and rain, we walked through their front door and were told they're closing at 9:30, even though they normally close at 11. No explanation was given. It was only 9:20 when we got there, but they refused to seat us anyways. I was really looking forward to eating here, so their complete lack of consideration really pissed me off. In spite of their good reviews, they're not worth it."
3,"The Block House in the Gänsemarkt isn't much to look at, especially from the outside, but the steaks are first class. A 250g rump or rib-eye will set you back around EUR17-EUR25, but that comes with a good-sized starter salad and a choice of chips (fries) or baked potato. One point to note is that a medium-rare is actually quite rare.. So, my friends had the steak, which apparently was wonderful, but I had the cheeseburger. EUR8.50 for a 200g burger with fries and coleslaw. The only complaint I have about the burger was that they didn't give me a choice of cheese, but otherwise it was great. Probably the best burger I've had outside the USA - however, it was my first burger in Germany.."
4,"Good food and great service. I would have given this place 4 stars but added one star for the owner/chef who was personally serving us; this guy is great and funny too. It is a small place and so not good for big groups. They have a set menu (which supposedly changes every week or so) but if you like seafood, you should try it. The price is OK for Hamburg."
4,"I ended up here by accident one Sunday afternoon when a heavy thunderstorm turned the Hafencity into an extension of the Elbe river. The place was tightly packed with people looking for refuge from the storm. I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and the low prices for coffee drinks (about a Euro less than Starbucks and Balzac for a large latte). They also offers salads and noodle dishes in addition to great sandwiches. Summary: Lovely chain coffee shop that offers more food choices and cheaper and better coffee than Starbucks and Balzac. Interior is stylish and staff is very friendly. My favorite coffee place now, other locations are nice as well."
0,"Just my personal opinion: Outstandingly rude security in front, truly incredible. And then once inside, nothing really worth writing home about. If it were up to me, I would go literally anywhere else!"
4,"Wow, super entertaining..... For 30minutes, water fountains dance along to music accompanied by a range of lights to change the colour of the water..... Whether you are a tourist or a local, would definitely recommend popping by one evening for this completely free event in planten u blomen park"
4,this place is awesome for kids and adults.  Its amazing how much detail went into creating all the miniature trains and figures.  The new airport model is in a class in its own and I watched it for half an hour before my girl friend pulled me away.  This is a must see attraction in Hamburg*this place often gets full quick but you can make a time reservation so you don't have to stand in line.  The later evening times have less people and are more enjoyable.
3,"Love this place especially during spring, drinks are yummy n strong, wide variety.music sometimes is too loud to talk n the toilets a bit smelly."
1,"Nice place, simple food but tasty, yummy Hefe but when it came to paying the bill was furious to be charged for it twice- I still need to go back and get my money back!!"
0,"Stopped in late for a beer and a burger.  Sat at the bar.  Placed our order with hip punk-rock waiter guy and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.  Enjoyed watching the staff eat their food further down the bar while we waited... and waited... and waited.  Finally, after a while we told our waiter that we couldn't wait any longer.  He told us to hold on and that he'd check our food's status in the kitchen.  He came back out and wouldn't make eye contact with  us. Douche.So, the food could have been good, but we never found out.  The service was ass."
3,"This is a very cozy and nice place to hang out and grab some food with friends. They have great vegetarian/vegan choices and are a good pick for people who like the middle-eastern cuisine. Unfortunately they were out of a few things that I wanted to try when we were there but my overall experience was still good. The prices are very good, too!"
2,"Unique place. Almost without competition in the area.Cool industrial design.Coffee was excellent. It was my taste. Less acid. Cake was OK. We had ""Stachelbeerenkuchen"" and ""Damengedäck"". Very very sweet.Service was quick and friendly. However it took way to long to get our ordered stuff. Ok, it was Saturday afternoon. However a place like this should have a much shorter reaction time."
4,Very nice pub - good food - cosy atmosphere and lovely service!
4,"After tons of walking, we were in need of a break and decided to stop in for a late afternoon beer. The ambiance is quite lovely - hipster, but in the way where you enjoy it. Interesting architectural features, clean, and tiny little boat models in the windows. They have 4 beers on tap (I think 3 were pils and one was a wheat, all nice choices). Prices were reasonable and the bartenders were super friendly and were able to communicate with us in English (well one could, anyway). They don't take cards. They do have comfy sofas though to make up for it. Great music too. Make sure to come in and stay a while."
4,"If you're hungry, don't worry, this place serve you heaps of good food to a great price. Awesome afterwork place for everyone how wanna have something to eat or just a beer."
0,"Probably the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Rude, condescending and exceptionally slow."
0,"I would not suggest this restaurant and will never ever go there again. The foods are not fresh at all and the waiters are very unfriendly. AND i, and my mother got a stomachache right after!! It might be the worst restaurant i have ever been in this world!"
0,"The burgers do not taste very good. The double patty burgers have the same amount of meat as a standard single patty burger. I ordered a rare hamburger and it came as well done. My girlfriend ordered a cheeseburger and it came with burnt cheese. When we sent it back, they said it was supposed to be crusty cheese. Cheese melted to a crust can be delicious, however the cheese was just burnt. I recommend going to the Brooklyn burger bar, its very close. Make reservations."
4,"I just had dinner with my mom who is visiting me from California and I chose this restaurant for several reasons.  They have a very nice seafood selection of fresh whole grilled fishes, grilled scallops, tuna tartare, and a beautiful night view of the Elbe. When weather is warm like it was tonight, sit outside so you can feel the breeze and watch boats drift by. The wait staff is extremely friendly and service is good here without any posh attitude.  We ordered a sampler dessert at the end which I enjoyed because you do not feel guilty after eating three different desserts, haha!  My mom really loved it, and if you only have one night to enjoy a lovely dinner near the water, this local well known spot should be on your list of options.  If you enjoy sushi as much as I do, the sashimi on the menu is also nice but the options are limited. For a full bevy of sushi choices and an extravaganza of delicious rolls, Henssler & Henssler is just around the corner from here.Ask for Valentin, he is the best waiter ever, just charming and catered to our every culinary need spoken and unspoken :)"
4,"Oh my gosh, I love this place so much.My husband and I are huge ramen fans, and this place never disappoints. We've been to several ramen restaurants in Düsseldorf, and Zipang may even be an inch above those. We usually get gyoza to start, which is perfectly cooked with a flavorful filling. The miso ramen is my go-to choice, and it's always perfect the way it is. I love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the broth is so tasty. Mochi is a must for dessert. They sometimes switch up the flavors which is nice. I've had chocolate, vanilla, green tea, and black sesame. It can definitely get crowded in here, but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a seat. The outdoor seating is nice in the summer, and I like the Japanese style of the indoor seating. Definitely looking forward to exploring the menu more and coming again and again!"
4,"Top place! Absolutely a must try! Cool ipad ordering system, nice food ;) recommended"
4,"This is the new branch of the well known Hamburg based burger chain, featuring the famous Blockhouse Burger.The place I often have been to on Jungfernstieg is just too hammered and busy to be fun anymore, so coming here was a real treat. So it's the usual Jim Block quality and service, but with added comfort, plus free gifts for the kids.Very nice."
2,"Quick and cheap pizza to go. The dough is great, the toppings are lame."
4,"If you don't mind that it's quite packed, you'll love the place. The food is excellent and there's a wide choice, the atmosphere is very cozy, and the prices are not too high."
4,"I come here for the take-out falafel wraps. I normally buy one, then walk just down the road, buy a beer from sofabar and sit in the sun with my weizen & falafel. Perfect. I am yet to sit in the restaurant, but it looks perfectly pleasant."
4,"CASA FRANCO FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I came here twice with the company I was working for. Since my boss always paid for everything.BUT I'M SURE IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE :D I think if I'd know the prices, I would pretty much give it ZERO stars hahahah. kidding :)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, what we always got was:HUGE SCAMPIES ROASTET IN OIL + ALCOHOL served in huge flamesA PLATE WITH DIFFERENT FISH FILETS + a unique secret sauce made by FrancoSTEAK, small peaces of steak with different sauces.and more.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Honestly I don't remember it all but I know you get a lot, and all the seafood you get are really really delicious.I remember I dropped the whole steak I picked it up and still ate it, that's how good it was. But I was drunk anyways haha.LOCATION: Very very small, I guess about 20 people max. It's great, because it gives you a nice familiar cozy atmosphere.If you have the money and wanna do yourself somethiing good. Come here."
3,"Have been here for the first time. I certainly took a while until we got served. And it even took longer until the food was ready... But both, Pizza and Pasta were really great though, do it's worth the time!"
4,"We (Dave) has been looking for his ""holy grail"" of Restaurants in every country! This was it for Hamburg! The service, food and ambience was all 5 stars! They don't have an English menu, so the very patient server walked us through the whole thing then recommended an amazing French wine that complimented the meal perfectly! If in Hamburg, this is a must try! The menu has something for everyone! Vegetarian and carnivore! It's considered modern European and it does not disappoint!"
3,"That's a weird beer. I like it but in Germany it's surprising to taste one that is so much different than most others. The weizenbier here is a little sour but it is pleasant, refreshing. Still, I don't know if I want it again or not. The haxe is tasty and fresh, although not that big portion as it first seems. A bit expensive but I guess for that part of Hamburg it's ok."
4,Best sushi ever! Really fresh. The tuna sashimi! Nomnonnomnomnonnomnnmmm! Really nice Staff! It was saterday and nog even half full.. they really not deserve that ! Good price for good  what Else do you want?
4,Very good restaurant if you want American food while in Germany. Terrific selection and superb taste. Lovely atmosphere and the bartender is a sweetheart.
4,"What a great little bar. Easy going, great music, live music, poetry, nice staff. Now hidden behind the new road."
2,"It's a reasonable place to grab a quick lunch. They have a bunch of pre-made salads and snacks available for grab and go, but the main counter has warm food. The general idea is choose a meat/protein and then mix with a carb. I usually get chicken tandoori with white rice, but they have salmon also. Also pasta and pizza are available. There is a small pastry/bread selection too at the counter."
4,"We were five in a group, everybody liked it, including picky German colleagues and as well picky Chinese. i am not in the position to compare it with other vegetarian restaurants, since i do not have many experiences. But as a restaurant, it is rather good. The sauce for rice, salad was made with care and delicacyyou can taste it! The price is in a budget-middle range, i just shortly glimpsed through the menu, many dishes cost around 11-14 Euro.Will definitely go there more often."
3,"Food: 5 stars    Value For Money: 5 starsIt only loses a star because the place has a grungy feel (the total look, the feng shui, as well as the feel of the table tops) but otherwise what you get for your Euros is completely superb.   The sheer variety of salad thingies that go on your falafel plate or into your wrap are just so tasty, so nurturing - - eating here keeps you alive in spades, on high octane.   And the smear of hummus,  and the droozle of tahini - - a bit of olive here and multiple veggie assemblages there,  this is flavor and substance and nutrition in heaping, power-pack format.   And those aromatic, hot falafels on a cool, multi-aspected salad plate - - the concept is knock-out, and the guys behind the counter are fast and adept.   Really, really good tucker."
4,"Not sure eye-opening experience is the right expression, but it's revealing things to none of us who can see would never experience before. Such as, how is it possible to put up with the fact that darkness is all I'll ever see till the end of my life. The guides are blind people, they are very open, will answer your questions, they make you feel comfortable to be in the dark, hard to believe but true. Definitely on of the best things to experience in Hamburg!"
3,"Went to Carls while staying at the Westin hotel on a business trip. Was confused first about where to enter. The front is more a small bar but the back is the Brasserie for dinner. After we cleared this confusion we sat down for a good dinner. Service was good and uncomplicated. Had the Codfish (skreifisch) dinner which was delicious and well prepared. Waiter was attentive and just when we felt that it was time to go he showed up with the bill. He was reading his customers well. Menus are in German (not an issue for me) but a place like this could benefit from an English version of the menu. I heard servers English spoke. Conversation going on, so we were not unique in that regard."
4,"Just go to this restaurant. If you want to eat the food that's cooked in India, this is the place. We took chicken palak and okra thali and samosa as starters. Oh god! I never ate samosa taste like how it should be before I came here. The food was tasty, filling and quick. This is how you would probably eat at food corners in India. Go badshah!"
4,"OMG.... great coffee - fair prices- great authentic atmosphere- super friendly staff! I arrived after a long trip and was super tired - was greeted with ""moin"" and felt like home straight away. I ordered a large cappuccino and the ""katzenfrühstück"" ... basic scrambled egg with Toast! Simple but delicious"
2,"Everytime i get non-german visitors we go to schweinske.it's an institution!! they have a wide choice of food, for very reasonable prices. Their salads are good, their hambrugers are good, their steaks and wurst are good! worth a try! Guten appetit ;)"
1,"The beer is good. The service was poor / spotty. I think they prefer their local crowd who will be there. Not child friendly at night, though they have a kids menu."
2,"Went here for lunch after hearing about it continuously from colleagues, who frequent this place for the schnitzel. Restaurant was basically empty at 12:30, we were served promptly and the food arrived in a timely manner. Unfortunately, my schnitzel was not significantly bigger than Chicken McNuggets. Honestly - for 6.50 you can get a decent sized schnitzel at several other places within a 500m radius from this restaurant. Besides the schnitzel, they have a dish of the day - my colleague's beef goulash looked really nice, so I'll surely come back here to try something other than the schnitzel. If you're in it for the meat n' crumbly, look elsewhere."
3,"One of my favourite bars in Hamburg. Very friendly and sociable staff, comfortable sofas, relaxed atmosphere and great cocktails at reasonable prices."
1,"A big no go for this place. The service was good, but the food a disaster. Me and my wife ordered chicken teriyaki and kunsperige ente. The chicken dish hardly contained chicken, guess chicken is rare these days. The duck dish was very dry. You could hardly eat the duck."
3,"Very friendly waiters and pleasant atmosphere. Some Dim Sum were tasty, some you need to get used to. But if you didn't try out Dim Sum before, this place should be a good start."
1,I've tried this place twice before writing this review and the jury is out now. It's a great looking cafe inside very inviting with comfy seating big arm chairs and dimmed lighting. The problem is Both times I've been here it's taken them more then 5 mins to come up to me where I'm standing at the bar and take my order.The staff don't seem to care that your a customer or potential customer and yesterday after standing there for over 5 minutes without so much as eye contact from the bar staff I just left as it was getting ridiculous. Disapointing.
3,Nice amusement if you want to kill some time on a rainy day. Very fair ticket prices.
4,"This place is amazing! Such great food! Decent price and great service, what more could you ask for?I came in on a slow night and the waiter gave me a free shot on the house. Not to mention the food was out of this world!"
4,"Very good I had the big currywurst awsome a must visit while in Hamburg ,always packed"
2,"Toiled password protected! You will find out that only when you come to it, no tip or any other message. And I'm not that kind of person that keeps receipt:/ got in just because a guy was leaving But coffee is good though expensive. I'd suggest to hang at least a notice at the way to the rest room :/"
3,"Crispy duck was good, bulgogi as well which comes with kimchi. The soups are ok, good do with an extra prawn and less grease. The price was excellent and service was good"
4,"Really cool vibe (I kind of want to live in here), friendly/attentive service, and excellent drinks and food. The waffles and poached egg with avocado on toast are standouts. To top it all off, the breakfast hours are very generous! My favorite coffee shop in Hamburg"
2,"Went here last night with a few friends after developing a craving for Mexican food. Overall a solid experience.PROS+ Burritos: grilled in a panini press and finished in the oven. Huge size, and very cheesy. Definitely satisfied at the end of the meal. The grilled chicken had a good seasoning to it, and the dish was improved by the two varieties of habanero sauce. + Service: our waiter was very attentive and pleasant, and answered the questions we had. Service was prompt. CONS- ""Nachos"": are essentially a plate of grocery store chili-lime flavored chips that tasted like they were dumped out of a bag. These were then topped with a sprinkling of pico and a few pickled jalapeños. Served with a small side of guacamole, which wasn't that flavorful. - They have tequila bottles (a decent variety as well) at the bar, but no margaritas. Was very disappointed in this. RATING3.5 / 5. The burritos were great, but wouldn't bother with the nachos again. Would likely check out other places before returning."
3,Fast takeout. A little pricey. Bf got a Bulgogi burger and he absolutely loved it. I got some edamame. Very delicious but could have been larger portions for the price. There seemed to be plenty of space outside for eating but the place was very popular and busy so all the tables were full. Vegan menu was fairly limited. Overall would recommend for adventurous eaters who aren't starving
4,"No doubt, the best burgers in town.After a walk around the Alster lake I decided to have a quick meal.It was about the third time I've been here. For a change I preferred the outside seating. It was a nice day...I asked for the JB Hamburger menu. It was very good, except for the potato chips that where too salty for my taste.I think this restaurant has fair prices.The WC facilities where very clean and the staff where friendly."
3,'raw like sushi' offers a great choice of sushi and bentos besides having lovely deserts. Important: the sushi not just standard maki & co but somewhat creative! These facts and the good atmosphere make this place a good alternative to the growing number of sushi place in Hamburg and is definitely worth a try.
4,Great coffee and food. The staff was very friendly. The vegan waffles were so good. The best vegan waffles I've had! Actually the place was so good I had to come back again the next day.
2,"I have eaten here 3 times now, twice for lunch and once for dinner and to be honest my experiences have been fairly mixed hence my score of 3 stars.I agree with the previous review in as much as there seems to be too few staff for the customers. In the evening when you can eat at a leisurely pace you don't really mind waiting a bit but at lunchtime when you need to eat fairly quickly what should be a relaxing break from work can become a highly stressful situation followed by indigestion! (and a big bill) However, I did find that if you stress to the waiters that you are in a rush they do try and accommodate you.I cannot fault the food though, everything I have eaten has been fabulous with the arrabbiata being my favourite. If you have plenty of time to spare and a few extra pennies in your purse its worth trying it out for yourself."
0,"I was suggested this place and brought to it by my boyfriend. As the ambiance is great, the clientele is anything but high class (the service and food was not much better). Not only did this over-involved couple who stared at us from the moment we walked in, made us feel uncomfortable and then to top it off, on their way out they wrote a very unwelcome note to my boyfriend (who did not speak great English at the time) implying nasty things about me and telling him to get up and leave the table. Mind you, we had been there barely ten minutes, not spoken much and I had never met this couple before in my life. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but considering my man and I were not fighting, nor were we having an argument or any other sort of spat, it was somewhat uncalled for and very rude. I know many people think they are so great at reading people, but trust you YOU ARE NOT. So before you think you can go get involved in others lives, maybe think twice. As for my experience at this place IT WAS DOWNRIGHT FUCKING HORRIBLE following that. Potatoes under-cooked, table water was WARM. Do not bother, not worth the service, nor the food, nor having to deal with the over-entitled, under-educated, arrogant clientele that this place attracts."
3,"Really good burger in Europe. Like the establishment and the touchscreen menu at the table. Quick efficient service, excellent tasting burger. You order it medium and u get it medium."
3,"Cool bar in between St. Pauli and the Schanze. They sell Pilsner Urquell pretty cheap and have a cool open mic night, which is what I was there for. The only drawback with this place is that it's a little bit isolated."
3,"Nice bar for an early evening's night out. It gets pretty packed quickly, so arriving early guarantees you a place to sit and cheaper drinks during Happy Hour (until 22:00). I had a Caipirinha, which was large and delicious, for 4.50 euros. I like this bar because of the unique ""fish"" tank in the center of the bar. Digital fish swim around the tank and digital leaves float on top of it. It's touch sensitive, so the fish and the leaves react to your fingers. This is really my favorite bit about this place, which has everything to do with the fact that a large chunk of my brain never grew up with the rest of it and I still have immense child-like fascination with these type of things. Recommended for an early evening, but try to get out early, as well, or you're going to have to arrange for a battering ram to force your way outside."
4,"Easily one of the best authentic Korean restaurants outside of Seoul. A pure, honest delivery of everything I adore about Korean cuisine.I ate here every lunch for a week, and sampled a broad range of items and found it all good.The Kimchi Jjigae is punchy, spicy and enriched with belly pork and pork broth. Loaded with flavorful kimchi and presented with a bowl of rice and 3 banchan, this was a must have staple for me at every meal.The pork bulgolgi was tasty, spicy, and fatty--perfect for stirring into rice and more banchan.The djajiangmein was a surprisingly pleasing bowl of spring udon like noodles, earthy slightly sweet black bean paste, and little morsels of pork to give depth and rounded mouth feel.Bibimbap was accompanied by fiery Gochujang sauce and loads of banchan vegetables.Service is friendly and quick--walk all the way in to the end of the bar to place your orders for lunch. Reservations necessary at night--especially on the weekends! They are fully booked for good reason."
2,"A nice restaurant, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The quality of the food was good and the meels were all typically german or austrian... But it was really not as elaborate as to justify the high prices."
4,"What a blast! Really enjoyed this place.  Got there early (0930) and was pleasantly surprised how few people were there already. Spent about an hour just looking through all the models and by the time I was leaving there was of pretty good crowd of people coming in. So I was really glad that I got there early. One thing I was not expecting was all the interaction that you could have with the models they were buttons that you could push to make certain models move. Of course, as a pilot, the airport was my favorite display and I could've spent a lot more time there"
2,"Went for the all you can eat wings fro 13.99 euros. It was alright, they have about 14 different flavors. The beers were nice, a large 500ml would be about 4.20 euros which is better than other restaurants. The waitress spoke English so I guess foreigner friendly."
3,Price worthy food in a nice atmosphere.I had the most wonderful schnitzel with actually wonderful potatoes (they're not so often wonderful but these were) and chanterelle in sauce. A lovely dinner indeed.
4,"Nostalgia is my favourite Greek restaurant in Hamburg as all the appetizers, hot & cold starters and fish meals are served fresh and tasty, the staff is very friendly like most of Greeks and the price is fair for this pleasure.You can simply go for mixed starter plates, baby sardines, a greek salad and gilt head bream ""dorado"" and of course with a company of ouzo plomari."
1,"Definitely overrated here on Qype. We had reserved at Taparia and they screwed up our reservation. Will next be docking their review on here but Casa del Sabor comes first. Right off the bat, I want to say we received very polite service. Place was packed and the young waitress did her best to get us a table. All is well at this point. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. First off, the food is mediocre. We had tapas primarily and had ordered six different plates. Each and every one of these was bland if not downright bad. The turkey with ""devil sauce"" (whatever that is) was horrible. The chorizo with white beans was also disappointing. The meatballs in tomato sauce we also just bland. The other plates.....completely forgettable. Worse than the food was the house wine. I am convinced it was watered down. Either it was a horrible 2 Euro bottle from Aldi or some other discounter or they added water to ""stretch"" it. One way or another, bad. Anyway, too bad that the food just doesn't work here. It seems genuinely Portuguese and could be a great little place to come for good food. Unfortunately, they've long ago stopped focussing on quality food and just rip off tourists at this point. In this part of town you'll fill your restaurant without even trying. Shame, since our waitresses were so polite. (Maybe they actually listened to the few poor reviews on here from others about service. I'll cross my fingers that they do the same with the food.)"
4,Zum Spatzle  is amazing. Do not pass up this charming restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful.  I had the lentils and spatzle and it was fantastic.  I plan to go back and try the soups and more spatzle. Thank you for my first great dining experience in Hamburg.
4,"superb food, superb choice, reasonable prices. nice that they serve with tea and chips while you wait to pick up a take away order."
3,"If you are looking for good German fair at a reasonable price, then you can't go far wrong here. Nagel is a traditional German pub, where you can drink and be merry.The food comes quickly and tasty, remember it is traditional so cash is the only way to pay for anything here."
0,"Went here as it was the closest to the hotel. Very disappointed. Got a steak that had the texture of being boiled, and wuite chewy. No effort from staff to correct or even take it of the bill although I hardöy had a bite from it. Will not be coming back. Ever."
4,"Theres something very dark and mysterious about this place that captures the imagingation. The selection of absinthe is remarkable, and the ordering process adds to the feel of mystery. The bar tender is fantastic, offering advice to the novice drinker (me) on what to have, which will aptly suit my pallette. Just brilliant...a unique experience and one which will definately be enjoyed again"
3,"Central Park is open!cozy nice placeA beach club in the middle of schanze! It's close to home, so i guess i'd be spending a lot of saturday and sunday afternoons there!"
3,"Are there any beach clubs in the UK? By way of explanation, a beach club is an outdoor bar with a layer of sand across the floor to make it like a beach. Most of these bars are next to rivers or lakes, but not always. Anyway Strand Pauli is the most permanent and generally the closest beach club to the Reeperbahn. The pluses are that the atmosphere is always cool, the seating is good and the view is interesting (so long as you like shipping). The main minus is that the sand is dirty and full of cigarette butts. The beer is kinda expensive, but cheaper than the other beach clubs."
4,"Great little cafe in the middle of a passage shopping area. They have awesome coffee, as well as ice cream cones. The area is great to sit and watch people going by, and at times in the afternoon there is even live music playing in the shopping area. It is nicely done, and reasonably priced."
1,"I used to love this place! Unfortunately the guy at the front desk has changed and I find him very unfriendly. I have had multiple disappointing exchanges with him in the few times I have been back this year already. The food has also taken a turn for the worse. Once when an item on the menu said cashews or raisins, it actually came with them. Now you are lucky if you get more than two of each. The vegetable portion of the meals now consists mainly of just onions (loads of them) and peppers. What happened to the healthy portion of broccoli, bamboo, coriander? Come on guys! Where is the love?! The restaurant needs real glasses, not plastic cups for our drinks. Lastly, the use of salt in all meals is excessive. I was a long time fan of bok but recently have only had disappointments there. I won't be returning any time soon unfortunately."
3,"Carrywurst, beer result in philosophical reflections), matchless Ceazar salat!"
0,"Im really dissapointed about this bar..First impression was ok, nice atmosphere, funky interior and good sounds.After 5 minutes I felt like leaving as soon as possible.Its way too packed, dancing is almost impossible, and the 50degrees temperature doesnt feel like any festivity either..The music is good though, charts mixed up with good tunes, house/rnb style. Among the crowd students and older, lost tourists tried to get drunk and create themselves a good night out.Mine was everything except that.. When this old lady with yellow glasses and 60s jeans started to dance like a fool..she must have been on drugs, although that must be a weird combination as she looked like a lost schoolteacher from kindergarten, I had to move myself at least 1m to the left, just to ensure myself not to get involved in her wild expressional, private dance. After my friend Kat almost got smashed to the ground and hurt her knee by some drunk fat yuppies, we decided to leave... I wont be back. But I probably visited Hörsaals worst night..."
3,"went with a Groupon Gutschein, great food and live pan on the table!!"
3,"I love theme bars, so Zum tanzenden Einhorn is right up my alley. Took me a visit or two to warm up to it (and to the very painful looking medieval weaponry on the walls) but now I come here for the tasty honey beer and the nice folks. This place is full of gaming nerds - my kind of company! I was a wee bit weirded out by the viking sing-alongs, but hey - it's all part of the atmosphere. It can get a bit packed here on the weekend, weekdays seem to be a good choice for a quick pint (if you don't mind that the entire rest of the pub will be sitting around playing Magic the Gathering). Skål!"
4,"Delicious, affordable, healthy options, very friendly and nice staff, and the place is super cute and cozy! Highly recommended!"
4,"It's Saturday night, the place is packed to the limit and the bar staff is doing an amazing job! Sitting at the bar watching them proves they are fast, in a good mood (occasional staff shots) and are making good drinks! Compliments, best team in the area I have seen so far (and I live across the road)! Music, atmosphere etc flawless. Great place to kick off after pre drinks or dinner!PS: and if the bar had known, a shared round of staff shots was offered to me and my friends shortly after posting my review! Glad I had nothing bad to say!"
4,I went there last month for the first time to take my after-lunch-coffee. nice little cafe near to the campus with delightful turkish food. My all time favourite for lunch is the self made PIDE  tastes great. yummy!
1,"After experiencing the Amsterdam Dungeon, which assumed everyone attending the attraction at least spoke English, I was excited to visit the Hamburg Dungeon.  What a disappointment.Out of our party, only my Dutch husband understood German, and only at a basic level.  Since I speak Dutch myself, I got the gist of what was going on but my American parents and best friend were left in the dark save for 3 videos that had English subtitles.  We made it known our party was english speakers, but this didn't make much difference.To give the actors credit, some of them did attempt to make the scenes understood.  I was chosen to answer to crimes as a sinner in one scene and the actor easily switched to english.  However, the overall experience as a non-german speaking tourist was disappointing."
3,"I became a fan of Thai food last year on a stay in the US...since then I really love Thai food and - of course - this was the reason to look out for Thai restaurants while on a short trip to Hamburg.I found Sala Thai Hafencity while walking around this beautiful part of the city - and went in for lunch. First: The place looks super. Very clean, nicely decorated and a fantastic view! The food I had was very good - a soup and hot chili beef. The slightly sour soup was very different from many other soups I had in Thai places...And the beef was very delicious though VERY hot. I am really accustomed to eating hotter than most other people...but that was almost too hot. So watch out when the menu says ""hot""! Service was great. Never disturbing, always nice...just like it's supposed to be. And the price was absolutely fine for what I got (might be different in the evening, though). To sum up: When I'm in Hamburg again I will visit Sala Thai again. This is a place I can recommend without hesitating."
3,"On our first night in Hamburg, our buddies took us to this bar. It was a pretty cool bar. Everyone was friendly, including the staff. We were there for someones birthday party. We chopped it up with Hamburg locals and some folks that were from out of town. Lots of cute ladies. It was a typical bar with the dim lights and music playing in the background to set the mood. I liked the bar except that they allowed smoking, but hey, it is what it is."
4,"Amazing. Menu is short  - like in very good restaurants. I tried Lamb and Sea bass, both were delicious. Note: they accept only chip cards."
4,"Everytime when we have non-Hamburg guests, we would invite them for some German dishes at Schweinske! It was my first time today at the Reeperbahn branch & it was better than I expected. Spacious, clean & the waiters are friendly. In general, love their schnitzels!"
1,"Médiocre hotel restaurant. Open later then some others. Not a ""must do""...Chewie veal, a bit burned gratin. Hideous and pretentious furnishing... Nice, but tired waitres..."
4,"I wish Panter was closer to where I live. It's one of the coolest cafes in Hamburg, but I never go here because it's a bit out of the way for me. The menu is a little bit limited, but what they offer they do well. For breakfast there is a selection of omelets and later the menu reverts to being just soup, salad, pasta or paninis. They also have a yummy-looking range of cakes."
4,A very nice restaurant selling southern german food. The dishes are very tasteful! The athmosphere is nice and the staff is great! You have to order the food at the counter and then it will be brought to your table.
2,"Interesting concept than the one where you have to take off your shoes if you want to eat! Fear not though, you don't have to do this in the entire place. As part of a group we were offered a sitting area with low tables and stools laid out on oriental carpets, only area where shoes off are indeed required! Be geared up with funky socks, as it may make the entire experience more exciting! :)I'm not a vegetarian but always enjoy the variety of food and mixed vegetables on offer. 9EUR for a falafel with chips, side salad and a glass of wine, I say pretty cheap experience for lovely & much filling food!Why the 3 stars? Although all the staff was really lovely, the service was pretty slooooow. None of us really managed to eat at the same time. One tip: don't order red wine! But again, I'm French, my expectations may be pretty high :)"
3,It's all decorated with Mexican wrestling accouterments and the burritos may not be California (or Texas?) worthy but they're better than anything you'll find in New York City.
1,"This was an absolute disappointment. Dishes were small and mainly consisted of the cheaper ingredients.I had the grilled duck in sweet & sour. I got a dish with literally 5 small pieces of duck and a lot of tomato, pineapple, onion, bell pepper and carrot in sweet & sour sauce. My wife had green salad with peanut sauce. That was hardly enough as a starter.Value for money is definitely out of balance here.Shame"
3,"I chose this place based on the comments on qype!It's a small restaurant/café in the Hamburger Hof 'mall'.We got there on a tuesday at around 6pm. It was empty, so we got to choose the table we found most appealing.The menu has a wide variety of food including salads, soups, pasta and pizza. They also have the Menu of the day which is written on a blackboard. It includes dishes that arent listed on the 'normal' menu.They also have an extra coffee menu. I had a salad, the rucola/schafkäse salat, which was really really good. The portion is rather generous. It's not very expensive.Two persons, 2 drinks was at around 20EUR. Very fair for what they're offering. I'll definitely be back"
2,Was quite disappointed with the service. The food was OK but I've had better.
4,"Great place to enjoy the view. They have good burger and their diabolo pizza is also not bad. If you came late, make sure you can find a good place. Because the beach outside is windy and cold at night, while if you stay too close to the stage inside will make the music too loud to enjoy."
4,"This cute little restaurant serves an amazing breakfast! You can choose between elk salami, boiled eggs with caviar cream, semolina pudding with fruit and various other delicious things! The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. Reservation recommended!"
2,"Depending upon when you go, Mutter varies a lot. On the weekend it'll be so rammed that you can hardly get through the door and it'll be smokey as hell - the smoking ban does not apply here. However, when it's not so busy it's alright in here. It's never going to be my favourite bar, but I had a nice enough time here."
4,"Our favorite Chinese restaurant! Good service, delicious food, and quiet atmosphere."
4,"Best place to eat turkish food around Altona. Very good quality, reasonable prices, friendly and fast waiters. Daily lunch is 5 EUR. I just know this place during the day. If you park you car outside, pay the necessary fees, there are always policemen around!"
2,"I was in town on business. I usually take the time to find the local Hard Rock to pick up a magnet from the shop if it is my first time in the city. This time I decided to stop into the restaurant for a late lunch as well.Location: An odd location in that it is not in the ""central"" Hamburg area. Unique, though, as it is within an old port building featuring great views of the port waterways.Food: Solid burger and ok beer selection. Portion was quite large, though, so come hungry.Service: Rather poor. I was there after the lunch rush and the restaurant was pretty empty. I figured I'd be in and out of there pretty quickly, but alas, not to be. My server was quick to the table when I first sat down, however, it was rather tough to get her attention once my food arrived. Spent more time chatting and laughing with the bar staff."
0,"Ok, before I start this review I have to say that the food is actually good and authentic. However, that is the only positive thing about this place. Let's talk about the food first.We ordered the pork udon and that was pretty tasty, even better than some of the udon places in California. The pork was flavorful and so was the broth. The agedashi tofu I got tasted good as well, but the portions were so tiny we literally got a cube of tofu per person. Next, my beef bowl was good too! The meat was tender and flavorful.Sigh. The restaurant itself looked so worn down. The chairs were uncomfortable, the walls were bare, and everything just looked like no one cared about it. Our server was the absolute worst part of the entire night. She was slow and when we asked what was in the twenty-five euro bento box she said ""I have no idea! What do you mean?""Then we asked her politely if she could find out what was in it, and she said, ""what?"" By this point I was already so annoyed. When she came back she really put the cherry on top of the sundae was telling us ""the bento box comes with salad, a miso soup, and rice of course!"" The she gave us a bad attitude when we decided not to order it. Even worse, she hardly came to check up on us, and when I asked her for the check she looked confused again. It was just a miserable dining experience. The prices were very expensive as well. The menu didn't explain exactly what you got, and it was again so old and dirty. For the food alone, this place would have gotten four stars (even with the expensive prices,) but the service was so terrible that I could almost safely say that this was one of the worst nights of my life."
2,"I only used to hang out with folks who would only go to Zoe II, then I tried Zoe III and I'm sorrybut they are exactly the same thing. Design, couches, bar, etc. Maybe I'm not a regular enough to appreciate the Sofabar rivalry going on in Hamburgbut really folks, it's the SAME bar just on opposite sides of the street. I'm usually pretty happy when I can just find a bench outside and some shade. Chill out spot, nice patio set a bit back from the street, good spot for a drink or two."
3,Mi Xao Gion was wig! Amazing. Def reco. She Pho Chay was shook. Also loved the spring rolls and the spicy glass noodle salad. Authentic decor too and friendly staff. Check it out. Also seems like most staff speaks English.
4,New look! Great party location. Music for every taste. Friendly staff and an interesting mix of people. Challenge the bartender and order a cockail!Toilettes: Clean & surprisingly cool. (at least b4 12 o'clock)
3,"Sit-down service only. I was early for an appointment and stopped in to get a latte macchiato to go. No paper cups = no coffee to go. :-( Too bad. I could imagine picking up a coffee and then strolling around in the park across the street afterwards. Regardless, the place looks extremely cute and was seemingly full for the time of day and time of week. I will come back and try out the food. UPDATE: Had some time this week to relax at a cozy table and enjoy a cup of coffee with the fluffiest milk foam I've seen in a while. It's the end of winter and from where I'm sitting, there's a perfect view of the Antebellum Gossler House up on the hill. This is such a cute place. Antiques carefully selected give this place real charm and character and warmth. While enjoying the dusk and eavesdropping to whispered conversations in the next room, I made my next happy discovery: the best cheesecake this side of the Atlantic - moist, like those in the US, without being too heavy."
4,"Lovely café with some places downstairs and more upstairs. One room upstairs is furnished like a livingroom of your grandma could be, with some cozy armchairs, sofas, coffee tables and wallpapered walls!I can't tell if the breakfast there is good, because I couldn't snatch a free table. But I assume it really is, because the seats to brunch on a sunday are fully booked two weeks in advance! SO MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION EARLY ENOUGH! Tip: if this place is crowded, go to the café called Caffeé Latte. It's just a few metres down the street and not as big as that place. They have some nice breakfasts as well!"
2,"I was curious because I saw these places all over Hamburg and I love Asian fusion! I have to wait 30 minutes to get my food. Also, I probably have a different working definition of what Asian fusion is...I ordered a vegetarian curry.... It said it came with tofu, but I couldnt really find any on the plate. Plus for an ""imbiss"" this place took forever. But I have to admit, the vegetables were fresh and I liked how they had sauces out on the table. I ordered spicy and although it wasn't spicy enough, I could pile on as much Siracha and chilis as I wanted. (People started to stare.) Everything here is gluten free so I guess that is great if you have food allergies. But really, the majority of asian food just tends to be gluten free in general. No surprise there. This place seemed pretty popular. It was hard to find a seat and I don't really know why. They have locations all over the city and are open late, so it is pretty convenient. Foodwise, it is just like any other semi-palatable Asian place."
4,"Wow. Really cool bar. I was well impressed to find the first Tornado table since I've been in Hamburg - good to know I can keep up the skills on this table type. Also, the tables are free, which makes it the first bar ever I've been in with free tables - simply unbelievable! The guys in here appeared to be of an incredibly high standard - will be good to get down here on weekends and check out the craic. One more thing. What is a washing machine doing in a bar? I need a drink, and some table football :-)"
4,Strongly recommend this place! Genuine turkish experience and turkish breakfast at its best.
4,"I like this place! Friendly people, associates and their coffee is great, salads tasteful and their bagels are 100% OK. Worth a visit and enjoy it!"
4,"pannfisch is essentially the hamburg's take on fish and chips and yes it's way better. i think they use three kinds of fried fishes. i have to admit that they taste a little funny like every time i have a fish dish in germany. it all tastes funny. lake fish. sea fish. so i guess it is its own taste, but i can grow into that. it comes with senfsauce which is a mustard sauce. good idea. packed with flavor as opposed to your usual tartar suace. and bratkartoffel always wins my heart. and don't forget to get your beer.this place is a one-man operation place. you go to the counter to order and to pay. they are not used to foreign tourists around here. i ordered in german, so i am not sure if they speak english. the bathroom is in the icecream shop next door, which also provides a seamless transition to dessert. 1 euro icecream = yes please. when your CEO works at yelp and he said he liked it, i have to believe it right?"
0,"The lunch buffet sounded like a good deal so we wanted to give it a try. The buffet table was diverse: sushi, Asian salads and main courses. Unfortunately the quality was mediocre, if even that. I usually never try sushi in other than Japanese restaurants and I shouldn't have made an exception. Can you imagine makis filled with leftover spicy salads?I was there with my husband and our baby. During the lunch the baby woke up and cried for a few seconds until we calmed her down. Since there were no other people around (we were pretty much the only customers) I breastfed her, very discreetly, covered by a big scarf. My husband overheard the owner telling to the waitress that they should charge us more since this is unacceptable.In sum: bad food, horrible service and all but family-friendly athmosphere. Avoid the place."
3,"Little Vietnamese restaurant that looks like it's family owned. Service was good and decor was nice. Menu is in German so bring your Google translate. Food is good by German standard. Since german food is usually not strong on spices it seemed like the taste had been brought down from the Vietnamese food offered in Canada.We had the shrimp and chicken cold rolls as an appetizer. The chicken was dry but the rest was ok. The sauce was the highpoint of this dish.As a main course I had the chicken curry. The curry had a good taste. It was indicated as a 2nd level of spicy out of 3 but it really was a 1 in my taste. My girlfriend had the pho and it tasted what it was supposed to.Overall a good experience that cost 23.70 euros for 1 appetizer, 2 main meal and 1 soft drink."
1,"Relatively inexpensive Steakhouse like restaurant. Visited for dinner on Wednesday night at about six to 6:30 PM. Place was absolutely dead. This is a large well decorated newer type restaurant. I'd be very surprised if they were able to stay open more than another four months or so. When we left around 8 PM there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant. Seating at the restaurant would be hundred plus. There were two of us for dinner, my wife had a tenderloin steak, which she said was quite tender and fairly tasty. I had a ribeye steak that was extremely tough. The manager came over and inquired about our meals and when I indicated that the steak was tough he did offer to make another steak for me. That was probably the best thing about the meal. The side salad was run-of-the-mill. The baked potato was nothing special. In a city known for its potatoes one would think that the potato would be something extraordinary. Think again. Overall a rather disappointing meal. The server was a very nice Turkish lady, who tried hard to speak English and help us out. Although modestly priced, there are better places to spend your loot."
4,"I am always a little nervous about engaging with vegetarian food, but this has definitely altered my perspective. Delicious falafel dishes and good beer options make this the perfect place to settle into for an early evening meal. The food came really quickly, was well priced and the atmosphere in here is very relaxed. Although I haven't yet sampled the pleasures of the takeaway, I was glad to see they do this. Living locally, I will definitely be taking advantage of the takeaway dishes on offer."
3,I had Mezze for lunch and I was more than pleased with my choice. The taste and presentation were tops and the portions were pretty decent. Very cozy restaurant and very friendly staff. Tip: it could potentially have mote tables
4,"One of my 'locals' anytime of the year. As a non-meat eater, I can't comment on the 'Haxe' or even the fish, but the appetizers are great, and never cease to satisfy. With a bottle of retsina and an ouzo or two, a meal at Nostalgia is always worthwhile."
4,Simply stated- the best service in Hamburg. Always a friendly and accommodating staff and the food is consistently very good.
4,Where does one hear the ships already better? Where does one see one more dog? Where does one see more Punks (there are it still) and infants on a heap? Where do the people wait so patiently and in a long line for their fried sausage? In the beach pearl! Directly at the beach of the Elbe stop of everything is possible. And n the winter: country under. Also beautifully!
4,"I love visiting the Central Park in the summer. Classified a beach club, the Central Park has just about anything you'd expect from a beach club, but without the waves. Sand, beach chairs, table tennis, grill catering, popsicles, tall glasses of Weizen and evening shows. The prices at the grill are moderately alright, they serve a good cup of coffee and an excellent Flammkuchen! The Central Park is open until 23:00 in the summer (as a matter of fact, it's open only in the summer) and is pretty full up until the last minute, especially on the hot summer weekends. My favorite time to to is on a workday evening or a Sunday afternoon. Recommended as a nice alternative to, well, everything else in the Schanze, a nice place to kick back with some friends, have a light lunch/dinner and drink some beer.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=qqjR…"
4,"Came across this restaurant while strolling along the Elbe, best service I had since I had moved to Hamburg. The lobster with truffle mashed potatoes is to die for! The seafood platter is also fresh and plenty for two people. Mojitos were delicious and they didn't hold back on the alcohol.I highly recommend this place for fresh seafood, great view since it is on the Elbe, and amazing customer service. Will come back for sure. Well deserved 5 stars. Also, the staff speaks multiple languages so everyone can feel at home."
4,"Great atmosphere, raw and minimalist deco, cheap original and fresh delicious cocktails (yep, all of it), awesome music, chill people...what would you want more for a Friday night?"
3,"Not accurately Mexican food, but very tasty and very inspired by it nonetheless. Tasty sauces with great tortilla chips, spicy burritos.We love to order from here.If your aren't lookin for authentic tacos, you are good here. They do not have any tacos unfortunately."
2,"Had a quick lunch in this Portuguese quarter near the clock tour on Sunday. Pleasantly surprised I must say. There are so many restaurants at this corner it's a bit confusing as to where to go. The lunch plates were about 15 euros each, and we had two entrees among the three of us. One was grilled squid plate, which was excellent, and the other was what seemed to be white fish fillets cooked in tomato cream sauce. The latter is also decent and gets three stars. The service was not outstanding but was acceptable. Clean bathrooms. Can't complain and did not regret going."
4,Nr. 88 +++++
1,"Beer review only.The beer here is very, very good. I could drink it all day long. And for the location and taste, the prices are fair. The restaurant is clean, and overlooking the water can be nice on a warm day with boats and people floating by.But, I'm never coming back here. The people are horrible. At first, I walked up to the bar because it wasn't clear. When I tried to order, the guy basically told me ""no, you'll sit down, it's full service here"" in a very rude German tone. When I looked shocked, he assumed I didn't speak German (I do) and repeated it in English. Then he asked if I spoke English, because I was still a bit shocked at his tone. ""You sure don't seem like you speak English either"" was his response. I should have left then...but I didn't. So, I grabbed a seat and apparently ""full service"" is German slang for ""slow as hell service"". It was 15 minutes until I got a beer. The refill took just as long. And it wasn't because my server (who wasn't as rude, but was far from friendly) wasn't working hard. Indeed, she was working TOO hard and had TOO many tables, so everyone's service suffered.As I mentioned, good beer, but I'll never be back. The people are rude, the service is slow. Horrible place from that standpoint."
2,Charming restaurant on the Shanze. I had the Trucker schnitzel (featuring two fried eggs) and just about managed to finish it - very tasty. The decor of the old Apothecary adds a nice atmosphere and its particular warm and cosy in cold weather with the hot water pipes lining the edge of the room.
3,We were going to the nighttime lights show at Planten un Blomen and walked down the street to look for a nice place to eat. Found several restaurants grouped together on Messeplatz St/Grindelhof. And after looking at Menus we choose this one. Good service and food. Nice atmosphere and not too crowded. I had the sweet curry chicken dish which was amazing and my wife had lamb. They have pizzas also which was an interesting combo but they were excellent. Highly recommend for a nice meal at a reasonable price.
0,"Sehr enges Restaurant und nur mittelmäßiges Essen. Noch nie so hektischen und genervten Service erlebt. Man fühlt sich wie am Laufband. Hauptsache man ist schnell wieder weg und der Tisch ist wieder frei. Nicht mal 45 min waren wir dort und das unter der Woche. Man wurde von den Kellnern regelrecht belästigt und nach dem Essen wurde einem einfach die Rechnung auf den Tisch geknallt. Unergründlich wie dieses Restaurant so beliebt sein kann, da werde ich meinen Abend nicht mehr verbringen."
2,"On the + side:- The restaurant is centrally located: Gansemarkt- Pizzas are affordable and gigantic (be ready to ask for your doggy bag)- There are daily extra dishes, which widen your options- Staff is friendly and attentive- There is a terrace, which is great on a sunny/warm day- There is a bar counter, so you could go for a drink or eat alone without feeling awkward- Good place for a bunch of friends to have a laugh or a family who wants to feed hungry kidsOn the - side:-It's one of those restaurants where the sound control is so wrong that it feels like you are in a canteen; it's ridiculously loud making a proper conversation challenging.-Ok pizzas are huge but when you really look at them, it's basically a huge crust of white flour with a bit of oil; if you put together the toppings, you realize that it's acually less than what a regular pizza would encompass...welcome to excess of starchy carbs and high glycemy...- I tried dark black pasta with seafood; pasta were overcooked (another canteen feeling) and seafood taste was covered by a way too heafty oil dressing...All in all, quite ok, I dont think I would recommand it though I wouldnt want to go back there eitherThere are better italians in town with better atmospheres"
3,"A restaurant full of surprises . The food was good (altho the pork chops felt a little bit overcooked, were pretty chewable still), the environment was romantic and relaxing. We also had small house salads for free and a typical Croatian shot for each person on the house.The price was very reasonable too (35 € for 2 people).But the menus they had were only in German and Croatian , and the waiters were not too good at English, being unable to explain what each course contains . Overall it's a very good restaurant and I'd definitely go again."
2,"Finally managed to come here a couple of times. It's the after-work place for drinks if you are in town. We showed up once and it was empty. By the time we left, an hour later, it was packed, both inside and outside. The bartendars are pretty cool and seem to remember you if you've come in more than once. The guy I was having drinks with knew them pretty well and service was promt with good mixing. I simply don't like the location as it's pretty poorly placed and hence also small. Also a bit of a weird crowd tends to show up hence it's a bit hit or miss on whom you meet here. The two times I was there it definitely tended also towards a sausage fest hence ladies, perfect for you. Not necessarily a singles bar as it was originally described to me. I thought this would be an interesting aspect but it never really panned out this way. Drink prices are good though during happy hour so I'd recommend trying it out."
1,Very expensive for average food. Feels a bit snobby. Waiters are busy but friendly. They politely resolved a mistake on our bill (5x Moscow Mules instead of 3x) without questions asked. However I'd rather spend that much money somewhere else.
4,"Have been coming here for many years - simple, excellent food.   My only complaint is that the price for the Normandy-Cider has become sort of crazy.     A small noise about a restaurant which remains high on my list.   Recommended for sure, especially for foreigners who think Flammkuchen is some variation of Pizza! (pfffffft!)"
3,"Very cheap and delicious fresh tasting food. The falafel isn't anything special but tastes among the best I've had in Hamburg. I ordered the ""falafel box"" which was pretty much a small sampler of all their vegetarian items on a small plate for 4€ (includes three falafel balls). Everything tasted fresh and very good - I was very happy with the meal for the cheap price.There's actually like 5+ falafel places right next to each other in this area. I've only tried Falafelstern and Kimo (the restaurant literally next door also serving falafel). I would definitely recommend Falafelstern over Kimo for better tasting falafel and sides."
3,"Very cute Scandinavian coffee shop, restaurant and novelty store :) When you first enter, it is decorated with of course the sweet wooden red horses that I own at home which I bought in Stockholm.  The colors are also very Scandinavian to me, with pastels, lights and brights. To the right is a boutique that sells Scandy candies, treats and miscellaneous gifts or decorations.  Once can stop in for a Fika which means coffee in Swedish or even have a nice meal.  They usually have Köttbullar, but since most dishes are made fresh in the back in a limited quantity, you have to check with the waitress to see what is on the menu that day. When I came in here, I ended up ordering some Tagliatelle with mushrooms and a truffle sauce which was very filling! I had wanted to of course try a more Swedish dish or even the classic Köttbullar (Swedish Meatballs) but to my dismay, they were fresh out of meatballs that day.Hamburg is actually heavily influenced by Scandinavian culture being so far north and in their history, the Danes and Swedes settled in areas around here such as Altona for example, particularly because the Hanseatic League had some battles over shipping merchant ships and even a history with Pirates.....and Vikings! I had to learn about this history when I did an Elbe/Altona tour :)Come here for breakfast, lunch or dinner they have cute names for their breakfast menu with Scandinavian themes like: the Oslo, the Stockholm, the Kopenhagen, and even you can order the Aarus. They also have wifi here!"
4,"RIB Happy Hour is awesome. 990 Euro for high-quality food. Forward: I walked by Jolie a few weeks ago and noticed two large guys rubbing their bellies after finishing off what looked like an entire pig. Both had plates stacked with bones in front of them. I asked a woman sitting outside(who turned out to be the owner) about the deal and she confirmed Happy Hour for Ribs on Wednesday, 990euro. Service: I returned for dinner last night. The owner was seated outside and seemed bothered that I was only there to eat food, not drink alcohol.  I was the only person in the restaurant so I would think my business would be appreciated. After a somewhat heated discussion about why I should order drinks whenever I go to any German restaurant, Claudia apologized and her smile came out, which was lovely. The waiter was young and jovial. Food: Dinner was great. Close to an entire rack of spicy-honey ribs, a small salad with sprouts, crispy potato wedges with sour cream and chives, and two pieces of perfectly grilled garlic bread. I don't even like garlic bread and I devoured the entire meal. A lot of food, a lot of great food for 990Euro. The ribs were overcooked in the slightest but not enough to warrant losing a star. The food was so delicious that it knocked the bad taste out of my mouth from earlier. I'll definitely be back with my girlfriend next week, and we will drink, and hopefully the experience will be even better."
4,"Excellent tasting Anatolian Cuisine. Actually no more words are necessary to explain. Every single item we ordered was masterfully prepared. Dinner time was very busy, so we decided to come later around 11pm. It was still busy, but very well managed. Desserts were both exotic and delicious."
1,Boring drinks and very young crowd. We are getting old and our visit here did not help. The lamp were nice though. A thought: is is just the Germans that put all the booze bottles on the shelves behind the bar? Not helping the decor...
0,"Horrible food. Will never dare to order it again. I ordered the food online. So, can not comment on the ambience"
4,"We had three nights in Hamburg and we ate here for two of them.  Might've been all three if we had known about it on our first night.  Pizza was great.  Lasagna was fantastic.  Fettuccine Luigi's was incredible.  Tiramisu was super duper. If you arrive after six you can expect a wait.  While you wait they will give you a glass of white wine, but you may feel claustrophobic standing in the narrow hallway especially with patrons going in and out of the bathrooms and the waiters carrying plates of pasta and pizza.  Go here and be happy.  Reasonable prices and portions with a friendly and charming staff."
3,"They were super busy when we arrived but managed to give us a table. We ordered quickly and the food came out surprisingly fast as well! I had the salmon, it's was so tasty! Definitely going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
4,"Really great food - excellent selection, friendly service, if a little slow. Really big portions. The grill for two people was especially nice."
0,"The food was delicious but the service was absolutely terrible. We came in at 5pm and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant, so understaffing was definitely not an issue as we saw many other customers (including the table next to us who came in after us) catered to in a timely matter. First off, they took an incredibly long time to get back to us (~15 mins) so we had to ask the waiter for the menu, to take our order and for the desert menu. The only thing we didn't have to wait 15 minutes then ask for was the water that they initially served us. The final straw for us was dessert. Not only did we have to ask for the desert menu after waiting around 15 minutes for someone to take our plates away, we also had waited around 20 minutes for someone to come take our order for dessert, at which point we both gave up on this horrendous service and decided to just pay and leave. We waited around 5 more minutes to see if anyone would acknowledge us, and to no surprise, no one had came over. We had to walk to the cashier to pay. The whole meal took almost one and a half hours and we only ordered one main course each since we gave up on dessert. I honestly think the Currywurst Kiosk on the Reeperbahn has better service.‍"
2,I had expected a little more after reading about this place. The cookie was tiny and the cappuccino a little weak and not really hot (I am a little bit picky though when it comes to coffee) still a better place to have a coffee in hamburg ;)
1,"The only reason I give it 2 stars its because of the lovely waitress that was taking care of us.I thought that this place was going to be a good experience for me, but it was actually very disappointing.Maybe they can't handle stress very well.. The place was super full...But still at least a dissent burger...I don't know if they have a problem with people who ask the burger well-done, I know a lot of chefs don't like it, but I don't remember I've ever got such a bad burned burger ever in my life before. That was the last straw for me... One and a half hours... First and last time!"
3,"Passing by one Sunday night, I saw the sign outside for Irish music night.  I'm a sucker for any chance of hearing a fiddle, so I popped in, wandered through the upstairs, and found my way down to the basement bar.What I found there was better than I'd possibly imagined --- 15 people with fiddles, pipes, Irish Bodhran drums, guitars --- I even saw a bass leaned against a wall, but not in use.  Good rollicking jigs, and several hours of them.  All instrumentals, which suited me fine.At one point I figured the only way to tell which country I was in was to listen to the two older guys having a loud conversation instead of listening --- and notice they were speaking German.Upstairs is fairly standard ""Irish pub"" look, but the basement decor's a bit odd --- the plaster is painted like huge wood beams and stone walls with ""windows"" opening out on blacklight-illuminated fantasy scenes.  One section of the wall has a sea god who belongs airbrushed on the side of a van.  Very odd.Food, eh?  The Guinness was excellent (though a half-liter instead of a pint), and the fish and chips was much better than I'd expected --- I'd rate it as a good but not excellent chippy.  I'll have to go try something meat-pie-ish, as that's a better way to judge the kitchen.The food was good, the beer was good, and the music was amazing --- I know for sure what I'm doing next time I'm in Hamburg on a Sunday."
0,"As a Pakistani, I was very disappointed with the dining experience here. Maybe I'm used to more traditional Pakistani food (from Karachi), but I was open and curious to trying Balochi style dishes. We ordered samosas, chicken tikka masala and karaih lamb. There was a stone or something very hard, possible a bone piece, in one of the samosas (vegetarian). We told the server and he said sorry, but nothing beyond that. It was hard enough to shatter a tooth if bitten on aggressively. Next, the main dishes were very mediocre - not very tasty, but most of all the portion size was ridiculously small. I was astonished at how little was provided in each dish. There wasn't enough for even one person, and each dish was 14 Euro. Not to mention that one order of samosas only had one actual samosa in it. I've never seen that at any desi restaurant ever. After ordering those 3 dishes and paying 45 euro we were still hungry. As if we didn't even eat. So we cut our losses and left to eat somewhere else. I would not recommend this restaurant. I just moved to the Hamburg area and still am in search of THE Pakistani restaurant I will go to when I'm craving my mom's food. This one failed horribly."
4,Best breakfast in the center of Hamburg.Try the self baked buns - best buns in town!The scrambled egg is very yummy and you should definitely try it out!
3,"This museum was so close to our hotel that we decided to check it out first thing in the morning.  We were not necessarily looking for anything specific but also wanted to see what they had to offer.  One of the special exhibits was all about video/computer games and it was so cool!  You get to play arcade/console/computer games that you haven't even thought about for years (or maybe you have).  I am so glad I stopped in for that alone.  The rest of the museum is ok, and will be especially interesting to you if you are more into furniture and design.  If you are looking for more art, check out some other spots around the city first."
4,"YAAASSSS!!!! It can be hard to find this place that's hidden away in a shady-looking building, but do yourself a favor and go! Have some almond coffee, a slice of cheese cake and feel the atmosphere of cool northern Germany. This is hipster in the best way possible and a pleasure to visit. Discreet place, but bursting with atmosphere."
1,"As I am just a Polish turist, my opinion on those wurst is... not so amazing.If you wish to eat one hot sausage without any fork or knife, this is a place for you. Just an usual sausage in the middle of city centre. There are some tables available in nearby, but it is still in a middle of a busy pavement. I wasn't amazed, still what can you expect from such a dish for 3 EURO."
4,Great selection of top quality meat but most impressive is the wine list. This place is serious about wine with the biggest selection of American wine I have seen in Europe. The Sommelier was also really great she recommended a Ridge Zinfandel with a little age. It went great with our Danish dry aged (90days)! They even show all the meat dry aging. This is great for a date night or celebration. Price quality was on point.
4,"Super. Super. Super awesome.Showed up shortly after opening to avoid the crowds. The only downside is that the coat check wasn't open yet so I was wandering around with my outer layers balled up.I loved all the detail, the scenes within scenes, the Elbephilharmonic that opens up, the airport with departing model planes, and the full on cruise ship at the end. Like some cheesy metaphor, there is tons to see and enjoy if you only take the time to notice. I went alone and spent nearly three hours here and made full use of the cafe because apparently walking around and looking at little things makes me hungry. Give yourself plenty of time to come, see, and enjoy."
4,"My boyfriend and I are in Hamburg for just a day and we decided to stop here based on the excellent reviews(though only few). You must keep the restaurants appearances out of your impression because the food and the hospitality of the staff make this five star worthy! I had the Wiener schnitzel, which was very flavorful and a huge serving! My boyfriend ate the curry wurst which was also excellent. If we were staying in Hamburg longer we would definitely make another trip here!"
4,"Best Restaurant in Hamburg. Food is amazing and the staff is great. The Mezze offers different starters every time, and the rack of lamb is delicious time and time again."
3,Pretty good place for a burrito. not the cheapest place to eat but great food.
1,the lunch pasta here has large portion.
3,"After a long afternoon of shopping/windown shopping in what is probably our favorite street in Hamburg we decided to rest our shoppign weary feet and grab a coffee. This place although large with four different seating areas it's still hard to find a place to sit. the place looked good though so we thought it was worth the 5-10 minute wait for a good seat. The lattes were decent, the cake moist, menu is well priced and atmosphere is chilled out and relaxed. A perfect place for brunch with friends or just afternoon coffee and cake. Good service too although you have to order and pay at the bar."
3,Found this charming place (by smell) on the way to the Warehouse district. I was SO bummed that I wasn't able to snag an English tour.  Why isn't this place on the trip advisor list - it's a total must do!  Who doesn't want a chocolate tour?!!! The shop is FULL of delicious chocolates made in-house and from around the world.  Definitely pick up some decadent chocolates! The ladies at the register are darling.
4,"This is a great spot to catch a quick lunch. They serve fine cut meats from pork to turkey along with potato and kraut. There's two sizes; small and large at 6,90 and 8,90 euros. Very fair priced. You may sit inside or outside and enjoy your meal. Obviously they are other items on the menu but these are the main attraction in my opinion. Also great, the staff speak both German and English so that made my life easy"
3,"This is a newly opened Indian restaurant in the Hallerstrasse. It's nicely decorated and the staff is very attentive. They also have a large selection of vegetarian dishes at good prices. My Tarka Dal was delicious and at a reasonable price. Only the service was not particularly fast, so make sure you have some time when you visit."
2,It was good to try German traditional type of foods. I liked the restaurant itself and so on. But the fish was very salty for me maybe it's because I'm not German
4,"We enjoyed our first lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe Hamburg so much, we came back the next day. It's always fun to see the different memorabilia displayed and the fun music selections. The host, Edwin was so friendly and personable. Our server, Nico was great! He was friendly and gracious. The food was very good too.  It helped make our harbor tour and trip to Germany even more memorable."
3,"Nice location with a nice view to the Marco Polo Terassen. Food was good and service was friendly. If you are looking for a Thai restaurant, can only recommend this!"
3,"My girlfriend is a chocolate lover, so when she visited Hamburg we knew we had to visit this museum.As with anything, it is all about expectations. We come from Costa Rica, a cocoa-producing country, so we knew that maybe our minds were not going to be exploted with new exciting information, but we wanted to have a different view of how chocolate is percieved in other countries, and of course.. eat some chocolate! And that we did!Regarding the language, we got there on a Sunday afternoon, and there were no more English tours available, so we had to go with the German one (I'm learining some, so took it as a challenge). We were offered a written guide in English for EUR 2.5 deposit which covers most of what the guide says. The tour consists of a combination of talks from the guide, hands on chocolate making, and lots of tastings of the cocoa seeds, and chocolate in all of its various stages of production. They guide was very friendly and knowledgeable, and even stayed with us for a while at the end explaning anything in English what we didn't understand. The gift shop is amazing (if you are a chocolate lover) with everything chocolate: choco pasta, choco pesto, choco beers.. you name it. Overall, a great activity for a rainy Sunday afternoon in Hamburg. We definitely recommend it to any chocolate fan."
4,"OMG! I never thought I will have multiple orgasms in a museum (almost). For everybody whose heartbeat goes up from fast racing cars, it's a must see. Absolutely professional presentation, and even interesting for kids (but you have to watch them constantly so that they don't touch the cars). Toilets, nappy changing room are also top class. Otherwise quiet and relaxed atmosphere, you can take your time to explore the past and present of the fastest racing cars of the world."
4,"The food is very good and the price cannot be beaten! The plates are huge, so don't order a big starter. If you do, I wouldn't choose the nachos, they literally just put them on a plate and fill three different package-sauces in bowls... meh.I ordered a tiramisu after my big ""Schnitzel-Burger"" with fries and even that was huuuge! And delicious as well! ;)Crowded literally everyday at everytime! No matter if you wanna have breakfast, lunch or diner! So the sound level is really high and you have to speak loudly to your counterpart.But it's definitely worth to wait a short time to get a free seat. Reservations aren't possible, it's a typical ""Kneipe"", but a really good one!"
4,I love self-service Bok - I prefer the no messing around feeling. I prefer the way the food is presented. I prefer looking at a few boards rather than that ridiculous 500 page book of a menu - it's so much easier to find something you want to eat. I also prefer the Wagamama-esque benches and communal tables - it lends itself to a much friendlier atmosphere. There's also no getting annoyed that you can't get the over-worked waiter's attention. The only real negative with this place is that it's situated underneath a Burger King. Oh well.
4,"Best Greek food in the city!Run by the real Greeks who put their hearts not only to the food but also to welcoming the guests and giving the best experience possible! I have visited a few Greek restaurants in HH and this is far the best one. The meat is fresh, well seasoned and never dry. Gyros and calamaris are my personal favorites. The portions are large and the prices are low :)"
0,"The taste of the food here is very mediocre. We were very interested in this place because of our obsession with potato dishes. Very disappointing. The place itself is very cool, but... the final thing that did it for me was seeing a mouse run by the table. The place has dark lighting which is probably why most people did not see it. I told the server and he said that it was normal as they are located in a basement and surrounded by water. When I saw the mouse a second time, it had returned from the other side of the dinning room and was very close to our table. I decide we'd had enough. I asked for the bill and they not only provided zero discounts, but the serve had the audacity to point out that tips had not been charged on the bill. I simply paid (NO tips) and decided to never return.."
1,"Terrible service for breakfast, atmosphere is loud and unruly, you usually can't really hold a conversation without practically shouting at each other. We just tried to order breakfast though and they just didn't take our orders, we tried making notice of us in between after she actually cleared our table and told us she'll be back as soon as possible to take orders but didn't come back at all, after 25min and trying to order 2 times we decided to call it a day and left for a different cafe. Definitely not going there again, prices are okay though and I guess I'd recommend it on a less busy day."
4,"From the moment we wandered into the back room where the stage was all set up like an old-fashioned living room complete with standard lamp and occassional table, I fell in love with Pony Bar. Friendly staff provided us with vegan-friendly sandwiches and delicious cocktails and coffees and we felt very much at home during our gig there. The venue is a little gem."
4,"This is actually the first place I've been in Hamburg when I first came here, so it's kind of special for me cause it brings up a lot of good memories, sensations and people. It's a great place to go if the weather is good and chill a bit drinking a beer or watching a football game, i.e. during the World Cup or the Europeans."
3,"Good place to go with friends if you are in Hamburg. Perhaps a little bit touristy, but it's fun! Went there twice during my stay in the city and had frankfurters and bratwursts, along with a cold Bavarian beer."
4,"For me this is the perfect burger place. The sizes of the burgers with a side are perfect for lunch. The taste is different, yet very much on point burgers with the perfect amount of asian flavors. The ambience and service is perfect. I would go here for a mid day burger anytime."
0,"Too expensive, fried noodles tasted disgusting! Too much oil and my friend and I both got food poisoning from it ! Can't recommend at all  !"
2,The 'Erste Liebe Bar' is a well designed modern coffee place in a great location. Away from traffic and noise. The interior is clean and modern with large bar and friendly staff. The breakfast menu is not huge but they have brilliant coffee and fresh juices. All in all a nice place with a pleasant atmosphere.
4,"First time having Curry Worst, my brother has had it many times and we both thought it was fantastic."
4,"Wow, what a delight. We went there for dinner and opted for the full 8 course menu. The whole concept is around using some innovative techniques and bold flavours in delicate dishes. The highlights were some veal with chickpeas and ananas. Amazingly powerful and delicate. Wagyu Beef with topinambur and truffles, this was just wow. The rich and melting meat with the truffles were perfect together. Another great dish was some sorbet served in Champagne. I am not a huge fan of Champagne, but combined with the sorbet it worked perfectly. Combined with some great wines and good service this was a very memorable evening. I can only recommend this place."
3,"I usually avoid American spots when traveling abroad, but German cuisine isn't particularly spectacular that I felt like I was missing out on the local experience (I could make a killing opening up a spice shop here). Plus, like everyone else said, eating a hamburger in Hamburg is probably one of those bucket list type of things.The decor is... interesting. It seems a little all over the place. Definitely American-inspired but with random Tex-Mex thrown in. Pretty loud space but open enough that you can hear the folks at your table. I highly recommend getting a reservation. We showed up with a group of 5 on Thursday night at 7pm and found ourselves having to wait at the bar for about 30 minutes before a table opened up. That said, the wait staff is very accommodating and will try to figure something out for you.Food-wise, pretty solid. I had the Bronx Jon medium-rare. I'm a fan of the English-muffins-for-buns approach. It's enough bread to hold the burger without giving you an immediate carb hangover. Temperatures seem to err on the higher end of the spectrum (most other burgers at the table were over). For what it's worth, the Bronx Jon isn't ridiculously greasy. All burgers come with enough fries to feed a small army.Nota bene: they only take cash."
3,"I believe this was the first burger joint we dined at in Hamburg and it is still one of my favorites. Yes, the burgers are hard to eat because the patty is shaped pretty much like a baseball and everything is contained between two small english muffins. But everything I've ordered here has been delicious and satisfying. The fries have that homemade quality and you get a lot of it. If you still have room after the giant plate of burger and fries, you have to have the cheese cake, self-proclaimed as the best cheese cake in the world. I believe it! The staff is nice and friendly. Always a good time and delicious food to be had here."
4,"Giving this a 5 star rating & it was pretty impressive! I believe it is best to come on a later time (5-6pm onwards) & they have less visitors. Your chance of getting near the rail to get a better look at the models are higher. Not to mention from 6pm onwards, you have a 10% discount!! It is not meerly model trains or planes ... If you look closely at the models, you would realize there are lots of stories to tell. Expect at least an hour minimum to spend in there (esp when you pay attention to small details). They also adjust the lights in some area to make it like 'day time' & 'night time'. Both, of course, are enjoyable to look at!!"
4,Best quality Indian food around Hamburg.Love the way they received us...Kebabs and chef special fish fry is a must try..!Desserts & samosas are freshly made and tasty
4,"It's a small menu, but the food is consistently yummy. Service is relatively quick for Germany, and has so far always been friendly and pleasant.Cocktails are *not* strong, but they are tasty - order for the taste, not the booze content. I recommend the red sake ...thing. Can't remember what it's called, but it's a sort of pomegranate-mint concoction. The tea is nice, too; the green tea is flavourful and comes in a generous bowl. The spring and summer rolls are always delicious. Always.You can't get a bigger, cheaper, better bowl of pho in Hamburg! I've had chicken, beef, pork, and tofu soups, and haven't had a bad bowl yet.Edit: if you're not in the mood for soup, get the bun cha (or bun something else) - crispy pork on warm noodles with cold veg and sauce to pour over it. So, so good, and quite filling. Oh! And their garlic-chili condiment sauce is so good you practically want to eat it with a spoon. I just shovel that stuff into the soup.Atmosphere is very casual, and if it gets crowded you may end up sharing a bench with strangers: it really is street-kitchen style. But that's not bad - it's very convivial. When the weather's cold and rainy, the windows all steam up and everything feels warm and friendly.This is one of the best places for lunch on a cold Hamburg day. Highly recommended! But note - it's cash only!"
3,"Very delicious sushi & tepanijaki place. Great price for the value, recommend! But come with an empty stomach - u eat a lot"
4,"I went there on a saturday morning for a breakfast/brunch and choose the breakfast buffet order. The place is super cozy, decoration is fancy and comfy and it never felt too crowded. The buffet had great food and a lot of options for either regular, lowcarb, paleo and veggie. You can drink as much coffee as you want with the buffet and they also include fresh made scrambled eggs that tasted divine. It's a suitable place for couples and families, totally worth your money."
3,I visited this Italian restaurant on my first trip to Germany. Our seat was right in front of the brick oven which was great to see and also the man making the pizza was most entertaining with his singing.  I had a large beer and a tomato and mozzarella appetizer. Let's not forget the main dish a large pizza pie with all the works. If you are not a big eater remember to share. If you have been longing to devour a large pizza pie on your own. Order and dive right in. I will be back on my next trip to Germany with my family.
3,"The Parlament is located underneath the Rathaus. It is very beautiful with a nice mix of new and old. The menu offers German specialties: fish and meat. Our waitress was nice, but the drinks took long to be served. Enjoy"
4,Owner was super friendly and gave us tons of tips about the best way of cooking the meat. The amount of food was really satisfying and as taste as it goes. We will definitely come back.
4,"I love having lunch on fridays at the Kornhauskeller. The staff is very friendly, lunch prices are well affordable and the dishes are always clean, tasty, fresh and very well prepared. My favorite is the fish in mustard seed sauce, but their falafel is the best I've had in Hamburg by far. Very very recommended! A Hamburg favorite!"
4,wirklich ein sehr gutes restaurant! pizza ist hauchduenn und einfach perfekt!
3,"I was here at lunch/breakfast time. The place is in itself very nice and has a cool atmosphare. The food was also good but some details were missing to be perfect. The choice of breakfast is a bit reduced for my tastes, but all the dishes were prepared with care. Unfortunately the egg was cold :( they have a much better offer of luch dishes, like pasta, sandwiches and soups. The say that all the ingredients are bio and home made. The service is nice but a little slowof course that could mean that they really prepare evey dish live and not microwave. At last i would like to point out the cool juices and the always available water!"
4,"Visit this place for authentic Cantonese Dim Sum, probably the best in town. This manifests itself with 90% of the dining guests being Chinese.The portions have European dimensions, the prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."
2,"This has been on our list to try based on the reviews. Sadly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the sushi. My hubby and I ordered the echtasien Mix II, so we can try a variety of rolls. The platter comes with 2 maki, 2 special rolls, 4 nigiri, 6 sashimi and 2 shrimp tempura. It sounds like a lot but the rolls are rather small and we didn't leave dinner too full, i.e. I could've eaten more. There weren't many choices for the special rolls since they had to be under 9€ for the mix platter. The food came out fast, which was awesome. The quality of fish seemed good, but the rolls fell apart really easily.Our waiter was really nice, the restaurant itself felt warm and cozy even though it is quite big, and it's located in a nice area. It would be a nice place for a date night. The quality and pricing of food was not comparatively better than other sushi restaurants we've been to, though. Perhaps the non-sushi dishes are good, but I don't think I would come back here just for the sushi."
4,One of my favourite places! Always get he chicken tikka and samosas!  Nice food for a cheap price! It can be really crowded and a bit of a wait when you go at a busy hour but at the right time it's great!
3,"For work reasons I wanted to try new Catering restaurants. Not only those the food tastes good, they are efficient, fast and know what their clients want! They come on time and are extremely friendly. Totally recommend them!"
3,"Excellent metaxa-giro, the fries are great as well"
1,"This is a really great bar if you enjoy being deafened by an Elvis impersonator so much that you can't even order your beer because no one can hear you. Oh and you're blinded by strobe lights. And surrounded by a mix of drunk college kids and older people who are still college at heart. Otherwise, I think you'll find the ambiance stressful, the beer so so, and the time worth spending somewhere else."
4,"Excellent customer service, great wine selection. Altogether pleasurable dining experience"
3,"Wow, talk about cheap and plentiful food. I came close to the end of lunch time when most of the food was sold out! I ordered the fish of the day. They were out of potatoes and asked if pasta was OK. I was given a HEAPING plate of fish and spaghetti (like the entire box).  The fish was covered in a delicious, savory yellow sauce (the color of hollandaise but tasted different - better). There is no English menu but the host and chef were very sweet and accommodating. There is limited seating inside but plenty of outside seating. Highly highly recommend! My second best meal in Hamburg."
4,"I am a HUGE fan of ramen so when this place came up as a new business in Hamburg on my feed, I couldn't resist going there for dinner and checking it out. I wasn't disappointed!This place is already uber popular! I got there about 6:30 and there was already a queue waiting to sit. Ended up waiting about 20 mins to get in and this was a Tuesday evening. I can't imagine what the wait must be on weekends. Worth knowing: if you arrive and there's a queue, you still need to go in and put your name down on the waiting list. Even when I left round 20:30, there was still a queue!I got edamame beans to start off with. They were well salted and tasty. The portion is huge for a starter. I would say these are enough beans for 3 . Next I got the Nitamago Wakame Miso Ramen. They have 3 bases on offer for their ramen: miso, shoyu and shio. They also all come with certain toppings; viewable on the menu and the difference between them tends to lie in the additional toppings. I was glad that they include a naruto on it; gives good colour and naruto is quite tasty.The best part of a ramen to me is the soup base and this base was amazing. Not as spicy(chilli) as I would have liked but this is something I've slowly finally come to grips with in Germany; I find the average spicy level here less than mild. Thankfully they provide additional chili to add, its called house spice  and is essentially a chilli oil. With the right amount of this added, the base was just right. Soft noodles and good portions of vegetables rounded it all up. Awesome ramen! This may just be one of my new favorite spots in hamburg. I'll absolutely be back"
3,"I'm from Italy, Rome and I can say that you can find good real italian food here. It might be the only or one of the few place in Hamburg.Good prices and italian speaking staff. Good if you want to have a real italian restaurant experience :)"
2,"If you've ever been to a Dungeon in another city, you know what you're in for. There are English tours available and I highly recommend you book one of those if you don't speak German. You will learn about the history of Hamburg in a very entertaining and interactive way. From the inquisition over the black plague to piracy and the great fire and flood, this establishment puts the fun into history!It's a bit gaudy, but a lot of fun."
4,"I went for the breakfast there... Very very happy about it! It is a buffet, cheap, with a lot of choice (even for vegetarians). I can only recommend it!"
3,"I found this by chance when coming from the station. Nice little place inside the Hamburger Hof. Food was OK, nothing special but I certainly ate it all with no problems. I found the service to be a little slow, but then they were rather busy, and it still was nothing to cry about. Prices are also very reasonable considering the location."
3,"Just in terms of the art of plating, this restaurant is easily in the top 10 of all time that I have ever dined at or experienced. Every dish was exceptionally photo-worthy, from multiple angles, and literally compelled you to take out your smartphone and photograph it. Simply put, our dinner was art on a plate. The food here also had many different flavor profiles and flavor combinations that would test the range of many people's palettes. The cuisine is French-Moroccan. Some could easily find it odd or mis-matched. I appreciated it because it was something new and often had me saying ""hmmm...interesting...good, but very different.""Seven courses per person were a bit on the pricey side -- moths flew out of my wallet after I paid the bill -- but it was a wonderful celebration dinner that night, all in all, for multiple reasons.If you really want to taste something a little bit different, bold, new or refreshing, where the food is beautifully plated, then this is the place."
3,"This place deserves four solid stars for its unbeatable location only: Hirschpark is one of the most enjoyable and pretty parks in Hamburg. And what can be better to take a stroll after fulfilling and hearty brunch on Sunday afternoon! The brunch itself was not outstanding: you will find a standard selection of warm and cold dishes, not too much and not too little. The bread selection was a bit disappointing, with no wholemeal buns selection, to which you get used to so quick while living in Germany. On the other hand a really good selection of deserts. Interior is very old fashioned, you absolutely feel that you are in a traditional Landhaus. Therefore a lot of old customers. Prices are not cheap: you'll pay 19 eur, drinks excluded. Keep in mind that tables for brunch are booked quickly. Would I suggest this place? Yes, if you want a quiet meal, opportunity to chat and no hassle. There was my mom, my boyfriend and me brunching together - now you got the idea :)"
4,"I went here last night with my family and we all absolutely loved this place! I got the spätzle with pesto,rocket and cherry tomatoes. The spätzle was perfectly flavored and had just the right amount of cheesiness. The cheese spätzle was also delicious. 5 stars, no doubts."
1,"This place has mediocre food at best. Been here twice now, hoping the second time it would be better. Oh well, not the case. Service is slow and fairly uninterested. Had to more often than once get up to get the attention of the waitress. Further, I find the ambiance to be pretty boring and not even that authentic. Finally, the food is average at best. I really couldn't say I found it tasty at all. It wasn't bad I guess but I simply expect a lot more from Greek food. It's not that hard to get right, especially the grill plates. They used poor quality meat as well which was really disappointing. Won't be coming back here again."
4,Fantastic and classy bar. Excellent whisky selection and not too crowded. Staff are very professional.
3,"Nice interior and friendly staff! Unfortunately, they ran out of croissants only 1.5 hours after the opening."
3,"It's not the most intimate or convivial décor - it's very ""hotel-y"".The staff are extremely attentive and helpful.Absolutely excellent gin and tonics, and their bar has an impressive selection.The burgers are some of the best I've had so far in Germany (...not as good as a *really good* burger in America, but very tasty) and the allumette (""matchstick"") fries are a little crispy, salty, delicious cone-full of heaven. Can't wait to try their selection of various proteins tartare (next time!). It's pricey - good for a treat.Edit:  I've had the steaks here once or twice now, too. The meat is high quality, but drastically suffers from typical German under-seasoning. I'd stick with the burgers."
4,"A friend of mine brought my mom and I to Plat du Jour for lunch.  It was so cute and French, packed with businessmen and women for lunch.  What a spot to truly enjoy well made food with a lovely ambience.  I had to go back, so I brought my boyfriend and his sister one afternoon.  We each ordered the steak because it sounded and was delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant forLunch with friendsLunch with business partners"
0,"It was our last day in our vacation in Germany. We went here today past 4pm and hoping to have an early dinner. There was only 2 guests when we entered and the restaurant was not busy at all. When we came in, we checked the menu and asked if they have an english version. The caucasian guy who approached us kept talking in German. My bf asked for the buffet price and the waiter got more irritated. Then suddenly he just walked away from us!!! This is so far the most arrogant and most rude customer service we've ever encountered! Worst is when we are leaving the restaurant, the other employee gave us the middle finger!!! We were like, 'what is wrong with these people'?!!!I used to be a waitress and we treat people with respect. We were completely appalled with this experience!!!"
4,"Absolutely amazing. If you are in Hamburg for a few days, I would say this is a nice little visit. Theres a lot of detail to see and easily miss. I felt like one hour was good there but if you are in to this sort of thing, you could definitely stay longer. There were multiple levels and lots of interaction. I think its great for families."
4,"There is no other option than rating this spot with five starts due to it's perfect location. There is obviously no parking and it's best to come by public urban transport and walk the balance. There are some simple food offerings, but they have a good selection of beverages. I also like the approach that they serve a lot of local brands besides the big brands of the large conglomerates. This is a mandatory spot to visit for every Hamburg trip."
3,Great coffee and cakes. Friendly and efficient service. Chic and stylish decor. I would definitely visit again if in town. It was also possible to eat dinner although we had other plans.
4,"Excellent Hunan style food with an extra menu in Chinese: some customers were Chinese  always a good sign. I went there with a Chinese colleague and let him order. We had some great ribs, duck, lamb, chicken and also a Sezuan style spicy beef soup/stew which was amazing. Possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had."
2,"If you want to have a quiet night out, and you are a fan of good service, then DO NOT under any circumstances go there on a thursday.On thursdays Sausalitos is a night club, packed with people (in suits surprisingly) who are there for the after work party. Any other day of the week should be rather normal.It claims to be mexican, but well its not - not really, no.But the food is nonetheless good.They have a wide choice and huge portions for acceptable prices.The have a wide choice of cocktails. I like the place.For eating everyday except thursdaysfor partying on thursday night"
3,"Stopped off for brunch on Saturday. My wife and I showed up around noon and found only a few seats available. Reservations seem really popular for breakfast here; I would definitely call ahead! Brunch runs from 8AM - 2PM and focuses on the classics: meat, cheese, eggs, eggs with bacon bits, OJ, and salad. I think it was just the right amount of food and selection for 8 Euro.Drinks, coffee and alcohol are available at the front counter. Everything seems to be self serve and pay afterwards. It's a pretty chill atmosphere, maybe a bit loud though when all the rooms are full. I'll probably be heading back."
2,"Sausalitos is pretty much a night club that serves food. This place is really nice for a bar/club but i wouldnt really call it a restaurant. The food is what made me drop off a star from the review. We went there with a large group of people and had a table reserved. The service was really great and fast considering the place is packed (it was a thursday during their happy hour specials). The food is your typical bar finger food. Considering they advertise themselves as a mexican restaurant i thought maybe the nachos would be good. I ordered the nachos and the cheese was extremly hard and a pain to seperate each chip. I got the guac and salsa on the side. Spoiler alert: the guac here is NOT green...it was a little grey looking and it barely tasted like guac. The waiter confirmed it was the guac i ordered. I would highly reccomend to stay away from the nachos. The food might not be great but the drinks are AMAZING! They have really fun cocktails here and awesome specials during happy hour. I got the 'flying kangaroo' and it tasted like a milkshake and you dont event feel the alcohol, but there is a ton in there. Also, the drink sizes were HUGE! The ambiance is totally a club feel, the music is WAY too loud you will find yourself screaming at your friends sitting next to you. In the basement they have the 'club' which has hip hop music, different than the 'restaurant' upstairs."
4,"My absolute favorite place to spend a leisurely Sunday morning meal. Eating fresh fruit, quark, reading a magazine, and listening to the conversations of others is all part of the appeal of Cafe Zeitraum. It's like being served in a friend's comfortable living room."
3,Pretty good gelato. I particularly recommend their sugarfree/glutenfree hazelnut flavor.
1,"It looks stylish inside but there are far better Italian places to eat - service was friendly however and it sounds like the pizza might be ""ok"".  The brown butter sage on cheese ravioli was sad, to say the least.  The ravioli tasted like average, pre cooked heated up ravioli.  The sauce was NOT brown butter sauce how it should be.  I was not worth €9,00.  I make this simple butter sauce at home and it's easy to make correctly.  What was served was not proper Browned butter but rather some kind of premade melted butter (probably with the typical shot of German sahne in the mix).  There were only 3 little sage leaves on the pasta making the flavor distribution a disappointment.  Wouldn't waste my money here... Especially in a city/country where eating out is not cheap."
3,"Super Konzept, meine Frau und ich gehen hier sehr gerne hin. Man bestellt das Essen (Pasta, Salat, Pizza) an verschiedenen Essensstationen, dann wird es 'live' und auf Bestellung zubereitet. Pasta ist immer frisch von der eigenen Pastamaschiene (man kann zukucken). Das Essen ist immer sehr gut und es gibt immer wieder Sondergerichte, die kreativ und lecker sind. Die allgemeine Atmosphäre ist immer lebhaft (nichts für ein intimes Essen zu zweit) und mann teilt sich die Tische mit anderen Gästen. Donnerstags ist es immer besonders voll. Einzigen Punktabszug gibt es für die manchmal langen wartezeiten an den Essensstationen - ist zwar nicht länger als man beim normalen REstaurant auf sein Essen warten würden, aber man steht hier eben selber an. Ausnahme ist hier die Pizzastation, wo man einen Buzzer bekommt und sich dann die Pizza abholt wenn sie fertig ist."
4,"We have a 1 year old that's constantly moving, so lately we've been getting a lot of meals to go. We went in on Sunday, a little after 9 am. Oma's staff was super nice when we asked for the food to go and also got us coffee while we waited. I've not been impressed with some of the  coffee I've tried so far in the neighborhood, but this was wonderful. I really liked the restaurant itself. Just laid back and cozy. Would've loved to actually stay and eat there if not for the toddler. I'm sure it would've been fine if we had stayed, but it's just not fun for us to eat and chase him at the same time. The food itself was great. Pancakes/maple syrup and Breakfast 1. Exactly what we wanted on a Sunday morning."
3,"Came on Phil's recommendation, but they didn't seem to be doing a normal breakfast. There seemed to be only two choices: scrambled eggs or muesli. I went for the scrambled eggs with bacon. It was a nice, if unspectacular, breakfast."
4,"best currywurst i ever had. Came here last weekend for a quick snack before seeing There Will Be Blood, and left 10 minutes later completely sated. Obviously I had currywurst and fries. I also had an ""African"" cider, which was quite nice too. The guys running the place were really friendly, if a bit camera shy (I asked for a photo)."
3,"The perfect place in Hamburg to sit and have a coffee/wine/beer and soak in the scene. Please forgive my American-ness but this joint is quintessential European. I felt like I was in a movie every time I walked by/sat for a drink. Fantastic people watching, clean bathrooms, speedy & courteous service. Babies, old people, young people, hipster parents, men that wear red pants, you can find them all here."
3,"This is our neighborhood restaurant. It is quite simple, but it has a lot of charm. It is a family owned restaurant, run by very nice and friendly people. You are kinda transported to another place, where the children can play on the sidewalk, and everybody knows each other (and we kinda do, because we are also kinda neighbors). So if you live close to here, or are close to the restaurant, come over and sit outside."
4,"This delicious Turkish lunch spot has to be one of my favorite, if not my favorite lunches in Hamburg. During the lunch hour (12:30 ownward) the line goes far out the door, so I recommend going early. From there, get your favorite kebab fillings. Other notables are the hot food bar and unlimited bread you can get while waiting in line.The all-German, very lengthy menu is a little tricky, but the good news is everything is delicious so you really can't go wrong.Cash only, so definitely don't show up waving your Visa around."
4,"The food was outstanding as was the setting and ambiance. However, sadly one member of staff was very rude - we had asked what the people next to us were having and then went onto order two separate dishes. We were then given three dishes and when we said we did not order the waffle, we just  asked what it was she was extremely rude - this continued when we paid the bill. This was a tad disappointing after a fabulous brunch."
4,"Karls is just awesome! I grew up going loads to ethiopian restaurants and having lots of ethiopian food so when the chance came to go along with a group to have some injera, I was immediately on that train.It is a small family owned and run restaurant that gives you a very cozy and homey feeling. Alex greets you with a smile when you get in and engrosses you with very interesting stories about origins and history of the food all through the meal as he brings dishes. He really cares about where his ingredients come from and its very evident when he speaks about it. On display are lots of spices, coffee, some baskets from Ethiopia and books next to the windows all centering round the theme of Ethiopia. Some of the coffee and teas are even available to buy.  We got a couple of mixed platters which came in the typical style I'm accustomed to. A large circular tray covered with an injera base with meats, vegetables and sauces on top for a couple of people to share together in a communal style of eating. Additional injera was also brought to eat. Everything was absolutely delicious from the bean sauce to the egg, mince etc. We all ate so much that at the end of the meal we had to seat back and relax for a bit before getting up. If that isn't an indicator of a great meal, I don't know what is. As it is both a cafe and ethiopian restaurant, also available are some cakes; the cheese cake looked good but I was just too full to try any and other treats you'd find at a cafe available.As we were in on a Friday night, we also got to experience the coffee making ceremony which they do only on Friday and Saturday nights so I'd recommend making a reservation and coming on those days if you would like to see it. The coffee beans are roasted as per the ceremony and coffee made for you to drink post-meal using the beans."
3,"This place is right around the corner from the Hauptbanhnhof and well worth a visit. It has a patio and limited seating inside but it was pretty empty when I got there and it was a Saturday afternoon. Service was perfect - they greeted me and sat me down right away and came only when I needed them. The menu is a fusion on Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai...I opted mainly for Thai. I asked for my noodle dish to be spicy, and I got what I ordered. Everything was made fresh and tasted delicious though I'm wary of restaurants that do different cuisines. I had my first Viet coffee and it was great even though I drank it incorrectly. Prices were average for this type of fare and food similar to what you could get in centrum without the huge crowds. I'd definitely come back if I'm in town again!"
2,"Regional food from Franken (Nürnberg) - northern bavaria. The roasts are very good, bratwurst and a nice selection of beers (try meister). Roast potatoes are fried not roasted - minus one star"
3,So cute and cozy and so schwäbisches 'comfort' Essen!  Everything is house made.  You have to order at the counter and they bring food to your table. My spätzle dish and my husband's Maultauschen tasted as if we were at my husband's relative's house in Baden-Württemberg.  Big portions.I had my schwäbisches essen fix at this place.
2,"- 20EUR all you can eat (I think that is all they do really) is actually fairly priced in my opinion.- yes agree with some of the reviews here, better sushi can be found elsewhere, however it's a 3 star for me still as the quality is good enough, and service is friendly- yes, cosy place but always have room for baby pushchair in the corner and staff is always friendly and helpful"
4,Honestly a must try if in Hamburg! The burger bowls are to die for. We also had cakes for dessert and they were AMAZING!!! the staff was really friendly too.
2,"Wonderful position on the Alster, very nicely arranged and designed. On other hand its quite expensive and waiters are unfriendly. I go there sometimes to bring our friends visiting Hamburg for first time because of nice location but the place is definetely not my favorit."
1,"If you need food come here, if you need good food, look elsewhere.Service is good, but it's not thai food they are serving, but on the other hand, it is boring and tasteless."
4,"So good food and such a good service ! It is a little bit more expensive than other restaurants in Hamburg but so worth it. You get what you pay for! You can choose from different side dishes, sauces and herb butters and combine your own meal. The waiter we had was very nice! He filled up our glasses in time and even tho the restaurant was packed with people we didn't have to wait for a long time for the food. The tartare starers is to die for!"
4,"Excellent food and great service. It's in an odd location, but we came in 30 minutes prior to closing and they happily served us."
3,"I really should come here more often, considering that it's across the street from me. I like it here because it makes for both a great coffee shop during the day and a really nice (albeit a quite loud) bar during the evening. They serve soy-based drinks, which is a major plus, and coffee until late. Need to remember to come here on a wednesday for some live jazz!"
1,Not very interesting. The display is a bit old fashioned. And just for the ones who like me use to carry with them a purse that is not a very small one you will be firmly asked to let it at the entrance The two main interests for us were the cozy restaurant and the bookstore.
0,"My partner and I thought the place was lovely - very minimalistic and tasteful. I loved the gorgeous wooden tables and floor. The service was awful though. I guess I'm the first to say it about Erste Liebe: but the waitress we had was really rude. I've never had the inclination to write and complain after receiving bad service but the waitress we had was incredibly unpleasant. She was rude from the minute she came to us. At the end of our visit, she snatched the money off of my partner's hands and stomped off without a word. It ruined the place for us, really. Unfortunate - because we enjoyed everything else about this place."
2,"I happened to come here with some co-workers for lunch after being told it is hard to find seats. Which in my opinion is a good thing. However, after getting there I see why. There are not many seats there! I also found that the cement benches for seating were not very nice. They are up against a large table that you usually share with other visitors. This is makes it very difficult to get in and out of those seats. The decor is nice though, very retro and creative. The service was just ok. Our server was nice but he seemed to be the only one so was quite busy. The menu is very small and they only have about 3 kinds of pastas and a salad. I had the pasta with pumpkin and chicken. It tasted ok but not very much chicken and the sauce was a bit too watery for my taste, definitely did not taste pumpkin. Overall it was just an ok place. I would probably go back and give it another try but it won't be on the top of my list."
3,"Excellent paella! The staff speaks Spanish, Portuguese, and German. It is reasonably priced, we were a party of three and ordered more food than we could possibly eat and only spent 60 euros including drinks."
2,"If you have to kill an hour to 90 minutes because you arrive early Sunday morning and the hotel doesn't have your room ready, you can visit just so you don't sit in the lobby.  Check out the airport miniatures,  it is really cool.  Kids will love the place for sure but i wouldn't go out of my way to visit unless you just need to kill time as I previous stated."
3,"I went here for lunch with a coworker today and quite enjoyed it. Quick advice: try to come at an off-time! This restaurant is tiny, tiny, tiny--maybe only 3-4 small tables. We ate relatively late at 1 p.m., and we still had people eagerly waiting for our table.We both ordered the same thing--the grilled fish plate and a cherry soda. I don't know if anyone speaks English here because we ordered in German, but it would have been easy enough to just point at the menu if you can't speak any. We had our food in about 10 minutes  or so. The grill-plates were amply filled with a few different types of fish and a tasty salad. There was quite a bit of tartar sauce on the side, but I didn't use most of it because the fish was that good.Also, even though the restaurant is quite small, or maybe exactly because it is so small, I liked the ambience of this place. The stools were all well-worn, the tables tiny, and the street outside old and cobbled. Many of the restaurants in the neighborhood are soulless cafes and kiosks, so enjoy something a bit nicer here--though still not too expensive."
2,"I found the place a bit over-priced for what you get. Standard Thai food without that extensive a menu. Further, service was mediocre at best. No one went the extra mile and it was default all night. Lots of people have already spoken well of the location and ambiance. I'd say it's good but not outstanding. There are better views of the harbor as well as in the Hafencity. Finally, I found the bathrooms to not be that clean. I was already there pretty late in the evening but if you are going to charge these prices, make sure someone is regularly keeping the washrooms tidy. I probably wouldn't go back, mostly due to the pricing for average Thai food. It's worth checking out though if you must do something in the Hafencity and you like Thai. Maybe we just hit a bad night for the chef."
3,"Relatively pricey, but excellent food - we had steak tartare (mediterranean + oriental style), ribeye on the bone and new york cut, topped off with a lemongrass sorbet with vodka. All awesome, though steak was not the best I've ever had (reserved, for now, for the Hix Oyster and Chop House in London!). Only downside was a degree of pretentiousness and mild obnoxiousness of other clientele - not really the restaurant/bar's problem (apart from the high volume of the mediocre techno dj) - all of the waiting/bar staff were excellent and appropriately attentive."
4,One of my favorite cafes in the neighborhood. Dog friendly and gorgeous interior decoration and super friendly owners.
2,"Saw this on one of the maps I got after arriving in Hamburg (either one of those from the airport or one I got from my hotel) and simply thought why not? Having been to other establishments of this type (such as the London Dungeon), I felt I had a good idea of what to expect when I arrived for the short trip. With nothing in English, it was not as easy to get scared at times (not knowing what was being screamed or howled - knowing the sound and the meaning is very different)! As a result of this, I think I missed some key parts of the trip - the pictures did convey some of the meaning, but I did not feel I got the entire impression that was intended."
3,"My roommate loves pasta and she wanted to come along to my last nice dinner with my boyfriend who was visiting for the weekend, so of course I took her recommendation but na klar did not take her along. Ordered the creamy salmon pasta - nice saltiness, perfectly fatty sauce with generous chunks of cooked salmon wrapped inside the noodles. Partner got the simple tomato sauce pasta - it was a bit on the plain side and a bit too salty, particularly with extra Parmesan. The Parmesan in itself was a highlight though - this cute, bright grater that looked like a children's toy was filled to the brim with real Parmesan AND left at our table so we could indulge ad hoc in Parma heaven. We also had some house wine, which was very generous for the price, and the setting was also very cute - I had some doubts about the location, right next to Landungsbrücke, but Pastalozzi is off on a side street and we were the only ones sitting at a dimly lit, dark oak table in the back. Also candles! What romance! Parmagnificent."
3,"Went for lunch on an overcast Tuesday afternoon. Not too busy and we got a table right after ordering. You order with the cashier, pay, and then sit and they bring out your food. I couldn't decide what to order and ended up with the pastrami special that was right in front of my face at the cashier. I asked for the sandwich without bread and over a salad and though confused at first that's exactly what I got! I'm impressed with the customization options here and that the kitchen got it right. The big salad with pastrami and a small bottle of water was 11.60, the ""menu"" price. I was expecting to be charged for the sandwich and the salad so this was a positive. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. Salad wasn't the freshest but it was decent and with plenty of pastrami. I think I was the only person there not eating a burger and fries so I'm assuming they are good too. If I remember well it was cash only, or cash and EC card only so be prepared!"
3,"This is a great date location with its hip atmosphere and attractive (and competent!) servers.  The food is aesthetically pleasing, varied and of a good quality.  If you have a larger group though, the volume due to its high ceilings can be a bit overwhelming and the price is quite high though understandable for its location.  All in all, a great place to eat when you're in the area!"
4,"This place is hard to find. Also, If you're someone who only leaves work at about 6pm, then you'll never be able to go, because they close at 6pm and only open on weekdays. Both of the above points are a shame, because this is a great little place. It's basically the Hamburg equivalent of good old British Fish & Chips, only in Hamburg they serve potato salad instead of chips. Portions come in three sizes, ""baby"" (3 pieces of fish), small (5) and large (7). I guess the names are meant to be amusing because a small portion would be more than enough for most people. Thankfully I had the good sense to order this. It's not particularly cheap; A small portion costs EUR8.40. However, the fish is excellent - it's just a shame about the location/opening hours because without taking a holiday I'll never be able to go back."
2,"I was there for lunch and it was ok. Nothing really impressed me: overage food (I had salad and my friend pizza), average service, average prices, no atmosphere whatsoever. Also service was pretty relaxed and I had only 1 hr to eat and get back to the office. At the moment there is a massive road construction outside and it's extermly noisy to sit outside. Another reason try another place to eat."
4,The best chicken sandwich I've ever had was from here! Super cute little cafe with delicious food. The staff is very friendly and service is great! It was right in the main area of Hamburg so very easy to find. I highly recommend!
3,"This is your typical dive bar (although now that you can no longer smoke indoors in Hamburg it's much less of a dive). Nice corner place which tends to get quite full later in the evening. It's a fairly typical crowd for Ottensen and isn't as edgy as you may expect from first impressions. I stop in here every now and again as a friend live right down the street. I've never found the staff to be rude and actually realized a couple times that they remembered me, even though I really am not there often. Don't expect an major bartending creations. This is your typical go-for-a-beer place and I also wouldn't trek from other parts of town specifically for the place. At the same time, you can do much worse in the area."
3,"We didn't book a table but they were able to find us a seat instantly in the main room. The resturant has two rooms first as you walk through the door and the section through a corridor with a display showing the special of the day behind a glass display. Both rooms were busy but not over crowded and all staff were very polite and welcoming.The restaurant is very close to a train station and in an alternative arty district.The decor is very urban and industrial but in a very stylish manner. You can tell all the details and artwork was heavily scrutinised and calculated for the right look.After much debate over the menu we ordered two beers and went with the Lamb shoulder for two at 23 Euros each this was one of the cheapest mains on the menu. We ordered two sides Chantellene mushrooms and mashed potatoe with onions.The drinks came quickly followed 20 minutes later with our mains, the lamb was served on a wooden plaque and our dishes were two wooden chopping boards with steak knifes attached by magnet. This was served with mini side salad of which you could choose the dressing and half a corn on the cob. The waitress charved the meat off the bone onto the plaque board then presented this to us on our table.The food was lovely, the meat was very tender and the sides were cooked perfectly and very tasty. We actually didnt need the extra sides as the portion was quite big. The only negative i could give was the price was quite steap however for good quality food, it will never be cheap. The mashed potatoe was fluffy with mini bits of onion and the mushrooms were sauted in butter and herbs. we orded a espresso and jager after the meal and the total was 70 Euro, not cheap but as we were satisfied this was not a problem. I would recommend this resturant but mainly for an occassion to celebrate."
3,"After experiencing Zoe Bar I just had to try out this place. It's a very different atmosphere. The general theme of dark has been maintained. Black floors, black walls, minimalistic lighting. The sofa's are incredibly comfortable and perfect place to chill and chat and watch whats going on from Neuer Pferdmarkt. The sofa's seemed pretty new and in comparison to the disheveled ones in Zoe Bar there was the definite trendy atmosphere present. Service was good although I was a little dissapointed that there was either various Astra's or Carlsberg. The music bothered me a little here. They had a wide range but all played quietly. When they started playing Alternative or trance stuff then that sounded plain strange when it was so quiet. I was there on a Friday night and was surprised how quiet it was inside. There was a lot of action over at Zoe 2 outside. And I had the impression people were coming over and getting there beers and going back over to Zoe 2. I will have to sample this place once more I think. Conclusion: A good bar in a good location. Minus one star for the music weirdness :)"
3,"Whenever i go to that place i do the smart thingI get there before 7 pm , because somehow it gets totally packed as of 7 pm. there's always a waiting line at the door. They have an All you can eat offer for 17EUR. You just sit on the sushi bar and have all those plates parade in front of you, they also have some sweets too (which are not that good FYI). the sushi is of course not the best in the world, but for a 17EUR All you can eat buffet, it's very acceptable. i have already been there a couple of times, and i most certainly will be back!"
0,"Not a really good soup place --- for typical Phó. Small portion, and full of artificial taste. ---- definitely not recommend for Asians.Very noisy environment and unfriendly  service."
4,"This is the equivalent of street food in Hamburg.  In the downtown area there are two right across the street from each other.  No place to sit, just stand and eat your sausages. I had the grilled krakauer sausage not the Curry Wurst.  They were awesome."
4,"The Hamburger Kunsthalle is a great art museum. It has different sections for old masters, 19th Century, modern art and contemporary art.  There are amazing paintings from Casper David Friedrich, Max liebermann, Edvard Munch, Max Beckmann and a lot of other famous artists. I enjoyed the visit very much."
4,"Love this place! Such a great and friendly atmosphere - the waiters and owner make you feel welcome! Be sure to reserve seats, it's a small place and very popular. There is no menu, everyone gets the 4-course Spanish/Portugese meal (suitable to you if you are vegetarian, for ex). Live music from a singer/guitarist included (loud then, otherwise ok). A fun time!"
3,"Friendly, relaxing, good beer, good crowd and lots of sofas. Great place to meet and chat. One of the best bars around. As you will gather from the other reviews, there is no name on the door, so make sure you check the map location. Oh, and all the sofas you can see is also a clue!"
3,"Came here to Hamburg to visit the sites but it was raining and a bit cold so we decided get some lunch and stay out of the rain.  We took a taxi to the  place and it was fully packed when we arrived around noon with no available seats so we decided to go walk around the shopping district and come back later.  We came back about 45 mins later and there was a couple empty tables so we decided to order.  I decided to get the lunch special for €10 which included a burger, fries and with a drink or milkshake.  My burger came out hot and juicy with lettuce, tomato and cheese with BBQ sauce and mayo all on a brioche bun.  There was Hellman's mayo and ketchup along with Cholula hot sauce on the table.   My fries were very hot and crisp so I know they just came out the fryer.  I decided on a bottle of Coca Cola rather than the milkshake.  My lunch was excellent in all.  I thoroughly enjoyed my burger.  Maybe the only thing missing would be some grilled onions and pickles.  This restaurant has no parking area along with most places here.  The place is in a modern building and close to a shopping district.   At least I can now say I had a Hamburg in Hamburg.  Yea I'm corny like that."
0,"The food is fine, but the service is so so so bad. I literally waited 90 minutes between ordering and getting my food. I've had two perfectly nice evenings ruined by coming here. Then again, it's always ram packed, so they're obviously doing something right."
4,"We have been here several times and really like it for grabbing a quick bite on the way out to do something or when coming home and wanting to grab something quick.I usually have the number eleven chicken wrap and like to get a couple of pieces of haloumi  chucked in, this is a tasty combo.We also really rate the falafel teller, all the flavours and textures on it really go well together.There is coffee and cold drinks (most importantly Spezi)There is seating inside and out, and a customer toilet.  The guy running the place is also very pleasant."
4,Fabulous Korean restaurant in Hamburg.  I am very familiar with Korean food.  Love the spice.  Especially love Yook Hwe.  Their version is excellent.  Restaurant was quite full for a Monday night & after eating there I understand why.  One thing- please develop an English menu.  That would be very helpful.  You can do only so much using Google translate.
4,"Fancy hipster coffee shops exist outside of San Francisco, go figure. Admittedly SF probably just copied places like this one.Elbold Röstkaffee has all the marks of a hipster coffee place: 1) Crowded with people sitting around, drinking coffee, and not on laptops2) More real estate dedicated to bean roasting equipment than restaurant space3) Visible bean roasting equipment4) Handwritten labelingDelightful chocolate candy treat served with the coffee, yum!, and a great place to spend the afternoon catching up with friends."
4,"Located on the ""high street"" of Barmbek on the Fuhlsbüttler strasse small thai/chinese restaurant. In my opinion they make the best peking soup ever! Cheap but very good quality! Highly recommended!"
3,"I have to be honest, this location is the main and probably only Vapiano's I really frequent in Hamburg.  For some reason, I do not stand alone when I say this is the most popular location, as it is not just the food that brings people here, but strangely enough, it is also the most social of locations. On most typical nights, you are crammed onto tables with strangers eating cheek to cheek, elbow to elbow. I mean, at times, we even have to battle it out to hang our purses, coats, scarfs, etc on the hooks that are just not enough to go around.  And do not even try to set your jacket or bag on a chair to store it, thinking that it will deter people away from sitting next to you.  NOPE, major failed plan.  This is Germany, they simply say, ""Ist hier Frei?"" essentially translated into, ""No human being is occupying this chair right? Ok, then please remove your personal belongings so I can plant my hungry butt down.""  Yep, Vapiano's is a hustle.  Hustle to get a tray, get in line, get your order in, get a drink, or stand in a separate area for alcohol, and then good luck getting back in line for dessert later.  Even with all this fuss, we all still go there... The food is not of the highest quality, but it is tasty and moderately priced maybe even considered cheap to the non student crowd, and the atmosphere is somehow posh-casual.  It is kinda like the Starbuck's of Italian Pizzeria food chains, not just in Hamburg, but even when I was in New York City, it is always a similar story and routine.  Local Tip: Go here on Thursday night. For some reason, that is ""the night"" at Vapiano's on Hallerstrasse.  For some reason, people like to be seen here on that night.  I guess it is because the week is almost over and people want to get ready for the weekend, so they come for cocktails, since it has decent food, and is near the train stop, it can bring people living in the areas of Harvesthude, Eppendorf, Rotterbaum, and even Mitte together simply because it is off the U1 Train.My favorite salad is the steak one with shrimp, a bit of surf & turf.  As far as pasta, I love the curly noodles one that has a bit of a spicy beef tip/tenderloin with mushrooms and rucola, and a creamy tomato sauce, yummy.  To drink, if I am not drinking my liquid antioxidant of choice, Red Wine (good for the blood!), then I take usually an Orangina, since it has a cute genie like bottle and a fresh citrus taste to it that goes lightly with any meal you choose, whether soup, salad, pizza or pasta."
3,StrandPauli has a great location at the Hamburg harbour. Its a great place to hang out in the beach chairs enjoying the sun. The service was unfortunately a bit slow especially compared to the amount og people. And it would be nice with some heating lamps and blankets for sundown. Prices were reasonable. I'll be back!!
0,"I ate at this place approximately one year ago. It's an experience I'll never forget because at the end of our meal we noticed several mice crawling around the restaurant. To add insult to injury, the waiter seemed annoyed that we complained about it. It's a shame because the food was very good, but I'm not interested in eating anywhere that is infested with vermin, especially not after someone tells me it's to be ""expected because you're by the water"". I'm shocked this place stayed open. Here's hoping they've since cleaned up their infestation."
3,I have a great liking for Chinese food that's why i was drawn to this place. This place kept its word. The food especially the Sezuan beef soup was mind-blowing.
4,"On my recent visit to Hamburg, I had a need for a good lunch.  Something other than a brat or a schnitzel and boy was that need fulfilled when I ventured into Luigis.   Oh boy, I had no idea that such good Italian food could be found in Germany.My first venture was simply a pizza lunch with a glass of wine.   Well that salami and mushroom pizza was one of the best I had ever experienced.   I have always held Pasquales in San Francisco to the number one pizza but now I think I have found a close competitor.  Awesome flavor and my wine glass was really like a fishbowl filled 2/3 full.   Thank you...My second venture was two days later wherein I experienced their spaghetti frutti-deMar.   OMG....OMG...done to perfection!   Very very good.   If ever I am in Hamburg again, I am going there for sure.Oh and the atmosphere is sort of eclectic and the tables are almost like shared in some areas with outdoor seating to be had as well.   Nice place!"
4,"Chicken chil/coconut dish was insane.  Excellent spring rolls ...  Menu changes every week, so expect something good"
2,"i like to go there sonetimes to eat a very fatty Schnitzel...but the place is not so clean,the service is average and not very friendly and most of the times they get my drink order wrong.The food is average but good enough to go there with some friends for not soending too much money"
3,I came in on first opening day. Staff is very friendly and food was very good. This restaurant is now on my regular weekly lunch break list. I give one star less because kitchen is rather slow but I give this to quite busy conditions in first days when we were waiting 10-15 minutes just for seats. Will see how things will look after few months. Hope the spirit will stay and food quality will not drop.
3,"This bar is in ok. Giving 4 stars for the reason I once reviewed this place as another bar :D So, I suppose, this place has no face. It is just an ok bar with sofas and cheap drinks. It is a great place to go in between, but I would never say smthn like: Oh, lets go to the Roosen today!:)"
3,"Very good! Can't believe it took me 5 years to try the place. Now I know why it was always so busy.My only negative is that the portions aren't consistent, I've noticed some customers getting preferential treatment with much more toppings, and this made me sad. Why do you hate me, Kumpir König!?"
4,I was not impressed by the name and other reviews of this place but we were looking for sushi on a Sunday and it was a bit challenging. So we followed our gut feeling and came here for nigiri and sashimi. I have to say I was very surprised. Fresh fish!!! Service was great. We ordered a chief's choice for 2 plate and we liked what we had. Comes with miso soup for start. Also bathroom is nice and neat. Will definitely come back.
4,"Beatiful setting/atmosphere and the food was outstanding!  Just make sure you read German or go with someone who does because they do not have an English Menu and the Waiters did not speak much English.  The seafood, salads and desserts were not only incredible to look at but were equally incredible to eat. Highly recommend."
2,"Curry Wurst and Pommes!Generous portions of friesFree Ketchup and/or Mayo = something you won't get at mc do for example! Freshly prepared (to a certain extent) Slow service but at least its a good sign that the food hasn't been sitting there for hours, waiting for a customer."
2,"I went with a friend of mine that I haven't seen for years to have a dinner there, he told me that the pizza there is just out of this world. The place was a bit crowded on Friday evening, it took around 5 minuets to get seated which was fine. The waitress came and took our order and she was really nice. We ordered shrimps with garlic pizza which tasted fantastic. I was actually shocked by how big the pizza is over there.The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because my friend was drinking from a glass that was broken and he got his lips cut, and when they replaced the glass, the new glass was also broken. I believe they have to pay some extra attention to that.Overall, the restaurant is a one that I would recommend, but unfortunately we had this problem over there."
4,"Best burgers in Hamburg!! Cheesecake is also amazing. Huge portions if you order burgers with fries (I never finish it all, but you can order without fries) and a nice selection of drinks. Burgers have english muffin buns...otherwise authentic toppings (also made to suit your taste) and ""eat with your hands"" instructions on the menus :) Reserve seats for a weekend meal. Friendly atmosphere."
3,"We were hungry after a day of racing, but wanted some Hamburg panfish. We sat outside, and had a great meal. Not a bargain, but, with the great environment, and helpful staff, we were very happy. The roast beef was served cold, which is nice on a summer day, and the Swiss soup is nice with a celery base. Yum."
2,"ahhh roschinskys. I have ended many a night in here, and always wondered, well, why? Its exactly the same as every other bar long the street. It has the same people (are they cardboard cut-outs?) it even has the same drinks and the same bar staff. Not really original in my eyes and nothing special to write home about. The people are friendly enough, the crowd is youngish and the music is ok. nothing out of the ordinary, and too crowded late at night for my tastes."
4,This was such an eye opening experience. I would recommend everyone to give this museum a chance and let it show you a different world.
4,"Nice informal atmosphere, simple but cracking menu, country potatoes are the absolute best in Hamburg."
4,"I love going to Oren Ishii for lunch, and it is some of the best Vietnamese fusion I've ever had. It can get pretty busy during lunch, so I recommend getting their either a little bit before noon or around 12:30 when the first wave of people leaves.The menu changes every week with options for soup, chicken, meat and vegetarian available. I've had several things from each category and have come to find that chicken is usually a bit bland, and the meat options tend to be more flavoured.The ginger lemonade is yummy and a great accompaniment to spicier dishes :)I have to say my absolute two favourite meals since coming here were the pork belly steamed buns and the chicken wings!! Would love to see things like this pop up more on weekly menus."
3,The Chocoversum is a chocolate museum from the Hachez Company. Our guided tour showed the whole process of chocolate production and we were able to try every step of the process. Furthermore everyone can make an own bar of chocolate. The tour was very informative and interesting. At the end of the tour there is a chocolate shop from Hachez.
4,"I loved this place! The staff is very friendly and fast! However, in case you don't like waiting for others to finish eating, I suggest you to book a table in advance :)"
4,The Mexicana kumpir is incredible. Located in an awesome part of Hamburg with hip shops and bars.
4,"This place is fun as hell. It can get busy as hell too, but it's fun as hell. I really came for the airport, since I am an aviation nerd. The rest was just a bonus. And while I sort of had to rush through it, in the sake of a schedule, it was great to see and I will be back when I have more time. So, the airport part. You may have seen it on TV. It's pretty neat, seeing the planes take off, land, taxi around. Seeing the vehicles driving around. Seeing the airport go from day to night and back again (like the other exhibits). As an aviation nerd, I greatly appreciate the real airlines and real aircraft types being used. Now, on to the rest - really pretty neat to see Switzerland, Scandinavia, Germany, Hamburg, the USA and others all exemplified in miniature. Trains are what they are focused on, but that's hardly the only thing there. Just keep your eye out for fun little things - emergency vehicles rushing to a scene, dead bodies being fished out of the water with a coffin nearby (seriously), concerts, auto accidents, and various other random stuff. It's fun. U-Bahn and bus are nearby. Price is 12 euro per adult, which is worth it."
2,"What I like about this place:1) they give you unagi sauce and mayo with the soy sauce which both taste great! 2) The sushi are Creative and pretty overwhelming in taste. What I dislike:1) The Service and staff is absolutely ridiculous. I understand you guys got some fame now though online ratings but the staff truly doesn't give a shit about you. First time we came we asked if the kitchen is still open if we come in 20 minutes. They said yes, we arrived in 15 minutes to find out their kitchen closed. No apology, just a ""well you've to come earlier"" (but I just talked to you on the phone). Second time we came 2 orders were taken incorrectly and they made us feel guilty about not telling them right away when we got the sushi (well, it all looks the same to us) 2) The sushi quality is middle class. Don't go with the nigiri you'll be disappointed. It's not worth the price. Conclusion: if you like fancy special rolls, you love it when it's saucy - this place is worth to check out. The taste of the special rolls are great! If you care about having a good experience or authentic or quality sushi. Skip this place. Note that parking is a catastrophe! What we ordered and liked ranked from most favorite to least favorite:1) Unique Lady roll (was good!) 2) Crazy Man Roll (nice Sauce that tastes a bit like Marmelade) 3) Hot Strong Tempura roll (would skip) 4) Crispy dream roll (definitely skip)"
1,I had a family brunch here on Sunday.Good thing is that they have lego and toys for children to play near the entrance.
4,"I didn't have really high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised! We arrived at 2pm on a Friday afternoon in April. They said we would need to wait 45 minutes, as they let people in on a co trolled basis to avoid overcrowding. We didnt mind waiting at all, since it gave us a chance to rest anyway. The exhibits are absolutely mind blowing in terms of the attention to detail. You can also see the artists at work, as they allow you to watch the creation of new displays.  You will get the sense of how painstaking it is to create all the displays that they did. We enjoyed the Italy displays the most. We felt the US displays were put together a bit too randomly.   For example, you have a backdrop of a tornado, against a space shuttle launch, situated next to Las Vegas and Miami beach. The US displays were also a bit sterotypical, which included a ""gold rush"" scene that didn't seem synced up. Lots of fun though. The displays include working trains, lights, transitions from day to night, etc. Plan to spend at least 2 hours there."
4,"This café exceeded my expectations! The café was great, comfy, loud and people were enjoying the vibe and atmosphere the café gives.I went there with my friends and drank something after a long day at work while the other one is busy with studies and needs a breather.I recommend it highly. Please, make a reservation to go there, because we needed to wait for quite some time, but then we asked if we could sit at the bar. We wanted to drink and not to eat, so we couldn't care less if we sit at the table or the bar next to the barkeepers.Best decision ever! We felt the rock-vibe much more than we once felt at a normal table.I don't understand why people are complaining, but that may be because we went there in the late evening (around 21 o'clock) and got the full blast of hard rock or just plain rock. I don't see why people are offended by the music.And the people at the tables should be more realistic ... they do have two floors and only have a limited amount of staff. Naturally, people won't get beer as fast as the speed of light. I had no problems when I went there once when they just opened or just sit at the bar. I've got great service back then and even last week.I'd say that people are at fault for coming in busy times or days. Especially on the weekend, people tend to go there, because the Kiez isn't far from there. So, head up! It's worth it.And I do think the prices are reasonable ..."
2,"Ended up here to watch the world cup one evening and it was quite an interesting experienceto my left, a couple with a baby, on my right, a rawkus of Korean businessmen going at it like the world is ending on a bottle of something-or-other and their table grills. Every 5 minutes SLAM! and they all did a group shot.In the middle, myself and friends watching the game (and the businessmen) commenting on the fantastic English translations on their menu. I honestly can't remember what I ate, don't really like Korean food, but it was a good time and definitely memorable."
3,"The food here is great. It's tasty (strong flavors), varied (so many options), fast, and inexpensive. I love coming here for a quick and casual lunch.It's worth explaining the system at Vin O Vin if you've never been, because it's a little complicated, but definitely worthwhile:1. Walk inside, and tell the nice lady behind the counter what you'd like to eat. If you're new, try the small pasta plate (which is quite big), and you can basically choose from 3-5 pasta options and about a dozen vegetable and side dish options in any combination. You can also order meat options (costs extra) like a piece of chicken or some meatballs. 2. The server will make up your plate as you choose things, and when you're done, she'll hand it to someone to be heated up. (This is the part that's a little awkward, because you might expect to just take the plate and start eating. But it's worth the wait.)3. Find a table to have a seat, or if it's crowded, one of the waiters will help you. There's some nice outdoor seating in the summer. One of the waiters will take your drink order once you've sat down, and will bring some bread for the table.4. A few minutes later, a waiter will deliver your food nice and hot for the eating. 5. Return to the far side of the counter to pay for your meal. Just tell them what you ate/drank, and they'll ring you up.Guten Apetit!"
3,"So much more than meets the eye when entering gute stube. Go for the garden in the back of the weather allows for it. You get a lot of food for your money, we had the chicken salad. All good ingredients, however the salad was lacking a rinse. The rest was great. Delicious homemade bread was served as a gesture, and we had a delicious home made lemonade with strawberries and mint. Definitely worth a visit, and great service all the way through."
3,"The whole family checked out Xeôm the other week for my husband's birthday dinner, and everyone left very happy! As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with genuinely happy faces. Everyone was so nice, and the atmosphere was really cool. And the staff was beyond accommodating for a large group of people.The only reason I can't give this restaurant a full five stars is that my own food was not anything fantastic. However, I did try a couple of other dishes, and they were both delicious! Soo I guess it's hit or miss there. That said, I would definitely go back. :)"
3,I had the fit plate. It was very nice... They have a great pepper sauce.
2,Das Essen hier ist wirklich lecker. Pakistanisch und Indisch sind nicht besonders unterschiedlich. Beim Mittagstisch gebennsie sich allerdings nicht die allergrößte Mühe. Schmeckt trotzdem immernoch gut. Die Bedienung ist mal so mal so. Gehe hier aber dennoch gern hin.
3,"YES, get a Hamburger in Hamburg!!Fun place, good vibe, youthful crowd. St.Pauli area of Hamburg. English widen spoken. Good music from the 70's & 80's.  HUGE 1/2 lb thick burgers, order them MEDIUM RARE 4 juicy. Tiny ""Hamburger Buns?""( more similar to English muffins....DUDE?! WTF? Soggy fries :-((( even begging first to make them well cooked, they haven't a clue how to cook FF!"
3,A great local bar - nice clientele and owner. Good select of beers. A great place for a night out. Smoky though - like most German bars
4,"The ""Strandperle"" is located at the beach in Övelgönne. To get here - you can take the ferry from Landungsbrücken or the bus from the main station (approx. 20 minutes). It is one of the best places to chill out in Hamburg. You can buy lots of kinds of drinks and some nice snacks at the ""Strandperle""."
4,"After a short wait to get a table, the breakfast was simply sensational. The coffee was good, orange juice was fresh, and the granola was delicious. I then had the avocado and eggs in toast with Pesto - delicious. Would definitely come back here."
2,"I had a nice solo lunch at this Bok! I read about it on Yelp as being a fairly decent and relaxed place for Asian food. The menu is in German and English. I had a chicken dish with yellow curry and various veggies, it came with a side of white rice. They claim it's one of the spicy dishes - I'd argue that, but, I'm from Oakland, California, where there are 10 spicy Asian restaurants within a block radius of my house - and we're spoiled. So when I come to Northern Europe and get ""spicy"" food it's often not spicy. But, it was warm and tasty and the restaurant had great music playing. I enjoyed it - I just needed something quick and warming in between work. Thanks Bok for delivering it! (And yes, too many locations in one area..very confusing :) )"
4,"The niciest coffee shop in Hamburg. Absolutely love it! It's run and decorated with so much care and taste, that it's worth just to go and check it out. And if you'll only see these freshly baked pies, tall and brown, with apples, poppy seeds, blackberries, rhubarb, plums anything you can imagine (depends on the season of course), you know there's no escape! They all stand on the table to tease your gastro-imagination, there are plates and cutlery next to it, whipped cream too, if you want. Of course, white table cloth, beautifull china, classic furniture. Let me tell you more about furniture: the whole place is like a living room of somebody's apartmet. There's wallpaper, paintings and drawings, tiffany lamps, wooden tables and chairs. It's intimate and warm, cosy and classy. It's nice and welcoming atmosphere both in the evnings and at the daytime. There's a garden for warmer parts of the year. There is variety of teas and coffees to go with these fabulous pies. They also serve food. And I heard that sunday brunch is fantastic (that's what I'm gonna check next), just make sure you are early enough!"
3,"I love a good dive burger place, and this place is really awesome! Came here for dinner and the place was packed, the hostess said that there were no tables available but the bar area was first come first served. There was plenty of room at the bar so it was easy for us to find seats. Immediately we looked at their chalkboard for their angry hour specials. Hehe, not happy but angry hour. There was a special for buy one get one free for the tap beer which we obviously ordered. Then we saw napalm wings for 25 cents each. We love hot wings so we of course did a half order of that. For the burgers, I went with a plain one as the burgers looked pretty massive and there was plenty of mayo and ketchup on the bar top for me to sauce it up if I needed to.For our drinks we ordered a couple rounds of the ratsheern red beer. It's a good light beer and I needed a couple of glasses once the napalm wings came around. When we ordered the napalm wings, our waitress warned us that it was spicy, we said. 'ja, we know'. Then she proceeds, 'No, IT'S REALLY SPICY!"" lol We were foolish and said, 'ja we like spicy!'. The waitress said ok.... and out came the wings! They were in a dry habanero sauce with a side of blue cheese dressing and some carrots. We took one bite and our lips were on fire. ok yeah.... napalm wings are REALLY SPICY! The flavor of the wings were still really good but I think I cried a little! So be careful when ordering the wings. It's a great deal when they are 25 cents but I'm really glad we only had 3 each. I could not finish 6 or a dozen!Ok, as my mouth was on fire, my burger arrived with a heaping pile of fries. I dove into the fries and couldn't really taste anything but burning. After the napalm wings heat subsided, I finally was able to eat my burger which was really juicy and delicious! I love how the english muffin soak up the burger flavor and I was able to eat the whole thing without a fork and knife :) Overall, it's a great place for great messy burgers! The staff is super friendly and were happy to speak to us in english or german. I insisted on german since I'm still learning and the waitstaff was patient with me and my shitty german :)Will be back for the burgers and I still need to try that cheesecake!"
3,"This place is very popular. Been here twice in the evenings and had to wait between 5-10 minutes for a table. And with good reason, the food is really good. The service is super quick, given all the people inside and those queueing combined with 2 waitresses.The menu is quite small though, ask for the English menu if you require it. Your choices are mainly between pho and rice vermicelli noodles with some meat. Very delicious food though. Top it off with beer Saigon or beer Ha. It should cost under 10 euros for your meal and a beer."
3,"I've always loved dioramas, so Miniatur Wunderland was totally up my alley. I really enjoyed all the exhibitions. The details are amazing! It was fun trying to look for cute and funny things in the models. We spent a good amount of time at the Flughafen exhibit--so cool seeing the model airplanes land and take off.We made reservations for 3:30-4:30pm. I would recommend this so you don't have to wait. Needless to say, it was pretty crowded since it's the weekend. Since the place is open until late, I would got after dinner or later next time. Hopefully it won't be as crowded. We saw an Italy exhibit under construction, so looking forward to checking it out next time!"
4,Another best place in Hamburg when the sun is shining. Next to the other bar ahoi it is just lovely to sit on the beach watching people go by
4,"Although I cannot make myself endorse anything related to tobacco I must admit the charm, kind staff and excellent espresso drinks at D&D saved my morning for a week while visiting Hamburg. Never start smoking!  Just drink coffee and enjoy the atmosphere outside away from second hand smoking :)"
4,"Good atmosphere, great breakfast.We took 1 large breakfast which was indeed large with mix of breads, yogurt, hard cheese, fruits and salad. In addition, we also took eggs and salad which was good but nothing out of the ordinary.Lovely opener for the day."
3,"Pretty cosy and comfy in here - once you were lucky enough to catch a free table. Then you can enjoy yourself pretty well. (Sadly advance bookings cannot be taken for Sundays as I was told a couple of times.)There's plenty of British traditional food on offer like (tiny) scones, pies and all sorts of tea. Also quite a selection of home-made cake but be aware of the large slices, deary me! But everything's lovely and definitely worth the visit. It's a nicely decorated (sofa, candles, paintings, walls painted in green) tearoom that makes one feel at home straight away. You can easily imagine three old British ladies sitting there gossiping away idlely and sipping their black tea. Well especially now that it's getting autumn and dark outside, Lühmanns is a great place for an escape. A possible walk around Blankenese and the water is a nice bonus as to the area. As the previous folks said too though, staff are always oh so slow and prone to forget orders. However they have as yet never forgotten about the billSo bring plenty of time & patience (and maybe a good book) and you'll be perfectly happy. I'd recommend it especially to anyone anglophile."
3,"Great food and location, amazing view. Nice bar to continue the evening after dinner."
4,Please go here to sample some excellent food and beer. A hidden gem in the centre of Hamburg.
1,"Tiefenthal is a cafe/bar/restaurant. Unlike the places at Schanze, this one is really ""higher"" class. It's crowded and unfortunately pretty expensive (but hey, you are in Hamburg - so it's not like you are already not used to it). We didn't go for food, just drinks and the cocktails were pretty good. The Tiefenthal is one of those places you can take your parents for a drink, or yuppie-kinda people (no offense). But if there would be alternatives in Eppendorf, I'd rather go there. As far as I can tell, there are none though."
1,"I walked past this place a number of times, I've never been bothered to go in but always had an inconscious desire of having a meal here. Maybe what my inconscious was trying to tell me wasn't something like you should try it but, at the contrary, something like leave it. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this place, for two simple reasons: food isn't particularly tasty and it's a bit too expensive (but probably not for the area). Don't really remember much about service or decorations, but honestly who cares if the food isn't good. So the recommendation would be to eat here only if you are really really, really hungry. Too hungry even for a 30 seconds walk to Grindelalle, were you can find something better and cheaper for sure."
4,"OMG Winterhude has a cosy coffee shop with wifi! Cute, not so little coffee and brekkie place with friendly service. Good coffee. And they had some teas too. Can't believe I didn't know this place all along. This place can be a good work from coffee shop place :)"
4,THE BEST SAUSAGES IN TOWN !! A MUST for visitors and locals. Ideally located for shopping and a quick snack
3,"Great beer, lively restaurant, and, at least to an American, great tasting German food at a reasonable price. Would definitely visit again."
4,"I went there for breakfast and ordered a cappuccino and Hummus Bowl (Lime hummus, beetroot hummus, edible wildherb salad, beluga lentils, organic pached egg, sesame, pumpkin seeds, sunflowerseed & sourdough bread). The coffee was great and the food was simple and tasty (it was more tasty than I expected).They have outside tables and an upper floor. There are some tables next to the windows with a view over a canal. Nice interior overall. The waitress was nice too.It was a peaceful slow morning in this nice café. I will be back."
4,"One of the best tourist destinations in Hamburg.  Having visited before it was the reason we chose to come back to Hamburg again.  No two visits are the same.Make sure to reserve your entry time online to avoid long delays at your arrival.Take your time at each display to look for hidden surprises.  Look for videos on YouTube to get your plan laid out for the day, and plan to spend the day here.  The airport alone is worth several hours."
4,"If it's too warm outside, you will enjoy the different flavored ice-cream such as raspberry basil or strawberry kiwi. You can also choose between different sizes of ice scoops and decide to eat it in a cup or a cone. You can either take away or chill in this nice cosy space. The waiters are friendly and speak English very well."
3,"Great food with fantastic seating inside! Very crowded on the weekends so expect a wait. The food is served in trays and very affordable. About 6 euros per dish served with bread, rice, yogurt, Dahl, small salad, rice and the main dish. Lacks true authentic spice but very good still. Recommend tikka and the saag, and if you're a fan of spicy just ask!"
2,"First of all, be careful when telling friends ""Let's meet at Bok,"" in ""Schanzenviertel,"" because for one, there are several chains in Hamburg and next, there are I believe three already in the Schanze area.   I first ate at the Bok on Susannenstrasse with friends from University when I moved to Hamburg, which we found was a nice meal, comparably to the Mensa (cafeteria) food that we more or less often ate on a regular basis.  This sushi bar is really great for students because it is casual, yet feels a bit upscale, but  affordable.  It is levels above Sushi Circle which I personally think people eat there simply for the entertaining factor of prepared sushi on a rotating belt.  Otherwise, instant sushi is never quite as delicious as freshly made to order. If I visit Bok, I like the location along Schulterblatt because during warm days and summer weather, they bring out long wooden benches to eat outdoors.  This street is great for dining outside with friends, people watching, and having some drinks well into the evening, then heading over to the several bars in the immediate area. I would go here if you prefer a variety of sushi choices, vegetarian options, like Japanese noodles, sitting outdoors in the warmer months to come and want to be in the midst of the buzzing Schanzenviertel neighborhood vibe, off the main street, at an affordable price."
0,Food is bland and service was worst. Very rude servers (young and old)!!! They all seemed pissed off that there's people in the restaurant! Never-ever again even if I'm starving and it's next to the hotel!
4,"The best location - combine the industrial-habour-romantic with a Caribbean island atmosphere and you got it... It is a unique location and a unique concept - you can't help getting happy, despite the food is pretty flat ( but take the burger with rocket and parmesan it's special but nice) and the crew seems like people getting the same pay as you would expect on a far Caribbean island.... But they serve massive cocktails that will make your mule kick. A must do in Hamburg at summer."
1,"Pretentious hipsters that make expensive, average food. :("
2,Not sure how this place got such high ratings. We made reservations since we heard it was highly recommended to reserve a table. My husband is a vegetarian and his co-workers told him about the restaurant. Just about everything on the menu had either mushrooms (which I dislike) or eggplant (not a big fan). We ordered a Tassajara Ice Tea which was bitter and not to our liking but we forced it down. I wished I had gotten juice or the Mango Lassi. My husband ordered the mix salad and I ordered the soup. The soup arrive hot and in a rather big bowl for German standards. I was hopeful the Eggplant Curry would be spicy and flavoured but it left a lot to be desired. It was bland and the only bright spot was that it arrived hot. The side salad and rice was tasty but nothing to get excited about. We decided to pass on desserts although they did look rather tasty.
4,Definately one of the best chinese restaurants in Hamburg. When the boss is there he enjoys to advise and explain the traditional chinese dishes at the back of the menu. Lots of chinese customers here as well.To access the restaurant you need to go up some stairs.
3,"An excellent Nopales burrito in Hamburg?  Sure, why not!The burritos are grilled (think panini press), which gives a great crispy texture to two sides.  The nopales were nicely juicy; the strangely gooey dairy component fell somewhere between Jack and sour cream, but managed to work.  Good black beans and rice added some bulk, and there's Tapatío on the tables.Yes, Jim Burrito is known for long waits --- the sign currently warns of wait times upwards of 30 minutes --- but we got lucky and grabbed the last burritos before they closed.  Short wait this time...The friendly staff is happy in either German or English."
4,"Superb! We easily spent the whole day there. And you need to! I took over 700 photos of different scenarios we found throughout the ""lands"". Absolutely brilliant. Something for everyone. The detail and thought that has gone into this is genius. The trains are so much fun to watch, the day/night cycle offers a different perspective, the airport is amazing (with takeoff timetable and self-parking planes!!), the mini Hamburg is fantastic as well. Plus all the little ""easter egg"" finds - so much fun. You guys have thought of everything. Quite literally kept us entertained for hours. There is a cafeteria as well, with food and drinks at a reasonable price. Great for recharging half way through and you sit in coach class booths. LOVED IT! Keep it up."
4,"Amazing coffee and extremely friendly baristas. Pour over coffees are superb and the cafe has amazing views of the canal. What is not to love about this place? On my second visit, I got wild and tried the food. No surprise, it was also incredible! I had the poached egg with spinach and avocado served on a huge loaf of fresh bread, all topped with coriander-basil pesto. Be still my heart! If you are close - come here, if not still come here."
4,"The food is authentic and high quality. The restaurant is very well decorated and the staff are friendly. Best of all, they serve food that would be served in Vietnam. Very authentic! I highly recommend this restaurant!"
4,"I'm so glad I found this place!One cold, sunny Sunday I was in the mood for a walk along the river, some hearty soup, and a peaceful place to read my book. Then up pops coffee al volo on my Yelp page, as if it were meant to be. For me, this cafe has all the comforts of home. The staff are warm and friendly, the food is made with love, and you don't feel guilty for staying for a couple hours to read, chat, or study. Each time I've gone I've seen people there with friends, family, or by themselves; enjoying each other's company or catching up on some work. Overall it has a very welcoming, open, and comfy vibe. As much as I love exploring cafes around the city, I've also been searching for my go-to, all-in-one cafe. Finally, I think I've found it! Definitely becoming one of my weekend staples."
4,"Great local place with an extensive menu, well prepared fresh, local ingredients, good local wine and beer at reasonable prices."
0,Slooooooooow.Bad fries. Waited over 30 minutes for a draught beer and lemonade.Capacity (outside) approx 56. There were around 10-15 people.Now it's 35 minutes.
4,"Really nice Café: I love to sit outside, drinking excellent Cappuccino or Latte! Far to much of good cakes for me...One of my favorite Cafés in Hamburg !"
4,"The chocolate tour was very interesting. Learned a lot about chocolate, where it comes from and how it's made.  Enjoy tastes from every step of the process and make your own chocolate bar. Super fun time ad great quality chocolate!"
2,"Food is okay, but everything is on the pricey side. Very interesting spot for a cosy italian restaurant. Always very busy amd very hard to get them on the phone in order to book a table. Best to just show up there and maybe wait 10mins for a table to open up. Despite it being hectic, the personnel do try their best and keep smiling."
4,"Tiny and cramped Indian restaurant with self service in the middle of Hamburg. The food is excellent at such a cheap price point, it's unbelievable. Definelty check it out if you love authentic Indian cuisine. Many vegetarian options available as well and their Mango Lassi is amazing."
2,"Traditional swabian comfort food. Not a lot of options in menu.We took lentils and Spätzle. The lentils mash had nice flavor to it, but the Spätzle just felt like raw pasta which wasnt that interesting. We also took German dumplings (Maultaschen). I was not a fan though my friend was. The soup was good though.The desert (some apple pancake with vanilla ice cream, forgot the name) was surprisingly very good. All ingredient completed each other.Also keep in mind the place is very small with only a few tables."
2,"Welcome to the Auswanderermuseum BallinStadt in Hamburg aka museum about emigrantion.First of all: I will not join the overall praise for this museum. Now, 3 days after I visited it, I still think the quality of the exhibition is pretty mixed.I visited it with friends, both fluent in English and German, and we switched languages depending on which seemed to get us quicker through, because the museum was pretty crowded on the day of our visit.We both had intermediate to advanced knowledge of German history and emigration waves from Germany. I don't know how much you would get our of the exhibition if you are just searching for information where your ancestors are from. That's because the exhibition is pretty inconsistent. Albeit, the general layout makes sense: Situation in Germany and Eastern Europe  Migration waves  Destinations - the development of the ships and the ship passage  Entering the new country (with a special focus on Ellis Island)  Immigration Countries other than the USA/Canada (Brazil, Australia)  famous immigrants who've made it.In another building the history of the BallinStadt is told, with the situation which led to the building of the barracks, their short-lived fate from 1901-1914 and the seemingly even shorter time between WW I and WW II. Plus the story about the back-then CEO of HAPAG, the shipping company that invented ship cruises and got big by shipping immigrants over the Big Pond.About the flaws in the concept:English vs. German:Everything is labelled in English in German, but the German label dominate, the English is always a bit shorter and layouted in a smaller font.Bigger picture vs. individual story:In the beginning you are confronted with six individuals, which should guide you through the exhibition and tell you their story. They literally tell you their story, which might be longer with the one and quicker with the other. Unfortunately you cannot skip  when you dialled the wrong language, you have to wait until they are finished. On crowded days, you have to stand in line, there are only two earphones per puppet, and you can dial only one language at a time for both earphones.And in the end you find out the six individuals don't really guide you through. You just see them back at the end of the exhibition, then they tell you what their life is like not that they are away from home for a couple of month or years. There is no alternative way to find out about their fate, you either wait and here or you don't find out about them.During the different stages of the migration, there are different individuals who show up and just present one piece of information, you don't get informed what their background is, et cetera. So if they already put such an efford in telling an individual's story, why don't they use it to describe the different stages of emigration better?History of BallinStadtThere is a lot of pictures and exhibition objects which are not labelled, and you might only get the meaning of it later on, if you get it.Conclusion:Ok, we learned a lot, and I think for kids it might be funny to run through a ship which changes from early 18th century to early 20th century within a few meters. But there is a lot that is forbidden to touch (not a good idea with kids). The fact that a lot of exhibition objects are not labelled and you might learn to know what it was waaayyy later is annoying.The entrance fee is 12 EUR, which is not cheap. As the museum is not publicly funded, it is heavily sponsored, f.e. by Ancestry.com. This is a bit ironic, because the digitalization of the archieves is publicly funded, so it is a strange kind of private-public partnership."
3,"+ Tasty German-French Fusion cuisine, + nice view over Hamburg Harbor, + recommended for business dinners, special occasions, and private eventsThe Carls belongs to Hotel Louis C. Jacob and convinces with the same outstanding quality. Although located in the hot spots of Hamburgs' new harbor city Carls is attracting the casual foodie. Its interior uses elements from French brasseries and bistros including a full French loaf as starter. At the Brasserie guests can choose between leather booths facing the restaurant's inside and the Elbe River or tables next to the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river or the new Elbphilharmonic. The menu includes a German-French fusion cuisine and a comprehensive wine list (EUR 20 - 390 with an average bottle price of EUR 40). If listed I recommend to try the cold vichyssoise (actually the best I ever had) in combination with 'Carls Fass' a dry Riesling.Be cautious ordering their water flate rate, which isn't a real flat rate since every carafe is finally balanced on your check! The average costs per person, including drinks are about EUR 65 if you order a la carte or choose a prix fixed menu with wine. People on a budget don't have to refrain from the delicious food since Carls' Bistro offers affordable small plates from EUR 5 - 13 and wines from EUR 4 - 6."
3,"Really cannot believe it took me so long to try this restaurant! Grabbed take out on a Sunday - and it was de-lish. Next time I will call ahead, but there is no menu online that I am aware of. We had Duck with Peking sauce, Wonton Soup, Chicken Chow Mein and veggie rolls. All good. Looking forward to our next Chinese Sunday pick-up!"
2,"Clearly a place to be in Hamburg.  After queuing for 20 min with the others, I could finally see the menu. Overall typical vietnamese choice. Nothing too extravagant.It took them a while to come and take my order.The food was OK, but nothing more. The pho missed fresher herbs and was quite salty. The spring rolls were fresh and crispy as they should be but the dip was rather tasteless. The pork on the bun cha lacked juiciness but had a good taste. Overall the bun was quite cold.All in all not bad, but maybe not worth the wait..."
3,"Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot.Whenever we meet you're usually grumpy. People say you're lovely but to me, you're just grumpy.This crisp Winter morning though you smile. You manage to brighten up my day. And for the first time I can see why people speak so fondly of you.A narrow city beach. Blue skies. Large container ships passing by and merging with the dockyards' silhouettes for a moment. A beach bar, a hot drink. People chilling, sunbathing, walking their dogs. Or kids.Hamburg, you showed me your pretty side. I can stay here for a while."
4,"My dad took me to his favorite restaurant where he feels like home the food is always consistent and real delicious. The service in incredible nice and are super friendly The restaurant is clean and has a fun vibe My dad got a noodle dish and he loved it, my dish was super yummy (liver and fresh mashed potatoes with applesauce .personally like the weekly flyer they hand out so you know the dishes  daily.The service is super nice and friendly And the owner is very nice and helpful"
1,"Two stars for the mouse I saw after finishing my meal. But then again I saw two big rats in a trendy restaurant in Paris!For starters the soup was delicious, disappointed with main course as I ordered fish that turned out to cold served (not mentioned on the menu), very oily potatoes, some cream on the fish. I just had the fish and salad. The fish wasn't bad after accepting the facts. p.s. look for the fish in the fish"
4,"Had a great 3 course lunch menu here for EUR6.90: salad buffet, soup and a choice of main courses. Impressed."
3,"Good value for money.Decoration looks very authentic India-like, though the place could be cleanerRecommend it"
3,A very popular location for dinner on a Tuesday evening - which was a good sign for us as we only had one night to eat dinner in Hamburg. Food service was quick and the food was authentic and tasty. If you want German food in a picturesque river setting and a very comfortable relaxed atmosphere this would definitely be a good choice!
0,"Burgers are ok. Cheesecake is good.Gave it a second chance to make up for the 1st time... But...Service is still HORRIBLE. 30 minutes in between even seeing a server. Bartenders running food. No method to the madness. This place is understaffed, over sat and mismanaged. 2.5 full hours from seating till payment of check for a BURGER. that's insanity.I won't be back to endure another waste of an evening"
4,"Outdoor seating, great food/soup, nice little sandwiches. Love it!"
3,"Always lots of people in here.  You order your food at the till, pick it up once your vibrating pad tells you it is ready and off to find your seat.As English in Germany and with very little German, challenge here is reading the menu and ordering.  I don't believe they have an English version of the menu and I never get the sense that the staff have good enough English to help you out but, this is not a complaint on my part as why should they right?  I am in Germany after all.Once I have my colleagues translate and order for me, the food tastes fresh and there is lots off it.  A large bowl of pasta or salad freshly prepared for you and tastes great.I always eat in so not sure if they do take away also.  As with many establishments in Hamburg, I think they only take cash so be warned."
3,"Honestly some of the best Pho Soup and Noodles I have had outside the United States.  The restaurant, though very well located in the innerStadt, was small and very crowded for lunch.  Being a very cold March day in Hamburg having the door open and close at our backs was a bit uncomfortable, but the hot soups and tea mostly made up for it. One can tell that this is a family restaurant.  The service was very nice and fast.  If you are looking for a warm quick lunch this would be my #2 suggestion for Hamburg.  Guess I will have to make a new list!We ordered two green teas, which got cold rather quickly because they are served in bowls, but by the time they were too cold the soup and noodles were there.  I ordered #15, which was viggies in noodles, always one of my favorites. My friend ordered Pho with Shrimp.  We shared the spring rolls which I could tell were made and fried fresh, not frozen.Looking forward to a follow up lunch at Quan do!"
2,"Very friendly staff, they made us feel very welcome and we were even drinking shots together.The starter was great, the overall fish quality was very good. However, they serve the fish with very flavoured sauces which don't suit the great fish quality. We've recommended them to serve the sauce on the side rather than on top of the fish.Also a bit expensive, 2 people - 100€ for menu and bottle of wine."
3,"High quality, delicious meat and sides. I ordered the rinderbraten oder (salted beef) with gravy, red cabbage, and krout. Each plate (you can choose large or normal sized) come with two sides. The choices are side salad, mashed or diced potatoes, red cabbage, and krout.The red cabbage and krout were sweeter than most I've tried. I particularly enjoyed the krout and was told it's both ""sour and sweet"" krout. There are also three types of mustard: süß (meaning sweet, seemed like a honey mustard), and scharf (meaning sharp, very strong) and mittel-scharf (meaning medium-sharp, still very strong)."
3,"As long as I'm sitting outside, on some sort of bench and preferably my thigh is touching someone attractiveI'm usually quite content. But, if the bar I'm doing it at also has a nice crowd and my beer is extra largeI'm quite contenter. There is a cat theme only shown by the little cats painted on the floors and a couple other places, but the kicker is the massive gun motif at the end of the stairs before the bathroom? It draws a big Huh? when passing, but after a couple Augustiners, it's novel. Great view of the whole area, including the squat whose rustic smell will hit you if you're there on a good day when the wind has picked up. Yum!"
0,"Coffee time should be a time to relax, reflect, chat or read (it helps if you're enjoying a good coffee too!)Balzundbalz doesn't seem to buy into. Common sense seems in short supply here! Today's visit was my worst experience in a cafe. Ever.I ordered from a nice gentleman and told him we were outside (regretfully I also left a 20% tip!) Then we ordered a water for our son. However, just as our drinks were being prepared we were told by a member of staff that we had to move the the pushchair (although our son was still in it, not wanting to be held!) onto a grass verge across from the footpath and the cycle path! The reason being...it was an obstruction. There was enough space on the footpath for a pedestrian or push chair to pass and also the cycle lane was not obstructed. As another customer that left shortly afterwards said: ""I don't see what the problem is! There's plenty of room!"" Furthermore, the design agency next door were sat outside on benches and tables having lunch - this was in a narrow part of the street and would cause more of an obstruction to pedestrians. A little common sense could go a long way - if we were politely seated elsewhere (we had taken up position well in advance to buying out drinks funnily enough!), dealt with in a courteous manner, or even apologized to over the rude brashness of the staff member I wouldn't take issue. If you would like your coffee served with a slice of over zealous officiousness then this is a perfect cafe! Fine, you don't want to lose your right to outdoor seating, it's easy to quote: ""we need to keep a distance of 1,5m from a cycle lane"", rather than deal with improving the customer experience. On the other hand, if you would like a coffee, peace, tranquility and good service - move along. There are many parents and babies in Eppendorf and this cafe is certainly not baby friendly (it's not friendly full-stop!) so I'd strongly advise heading to one of the other many cafes nearby. With regards the coffee...the cappuccino was all milk and no coffee and the long black was ""meh"" at best. It's a shame that the service and coffee aren't what you come to expect; the location is fantastic."
1,"Meh. The broth had little flavor, the noodles were over cooked, and too salty. I've had some great pho other places, maybe Hamburg you should stick to other things."
4,Really liked the eischnee mit grüntee! The dish takes time to prepare but it's an experience =D
4,"Not the cheapest lunch option around at about EUR9, but certainly a unique one. The various meals that I saw around our table all had a thin, almost soupy sauce, on rice & vegetables with either tofu or meat all contained in rather elegant bowls. I also ordered a green tea, which was a great decision! My colleague, Liron (see her review), had some issues with it being too spicy, but my dish was fine. It is worth noting that they don't serve anything without spice though"
4,"We were here with my Chinese in-laws, to give them a first impression of German food. so it was not the easiest for any restaurant to please us. However ""Goldene Gans"" managed to make us happy. It was crowded, but luckily they have a very nice back section, which I did not know about. So the restaurant is a good deal larger than it appears at first sight. The service was perfect and was not uncomfortable by a mixed language group (In-laws speak neither English nor German). The waiter handled everything graciously, brought the baby-chair for our little one (as soon as it was free) without the need for a reminder. Sharing dishes so everybody gets to try everything was no problem either an de got extra knifes and forks. We had deer, pork, Zander and trout. All tasted very good."
3,"For 21€ that's really a good deal. You will get more food than you can eat: the waffle was excellent, the orange juice freshly pressed and the Brötchen nicely warm. Moreover the place is extremely cozy. The atmosphere really makes the difference! Would totally go again to try a different breakfast option :)"
3,"I ordered vegetarian pizza without cheese. It was good, but not heavenly good. I would prefer less tomato sources and more olive oil. But vegan pizzas are not easy to handle. Pizza was served in a shape of heart with really beautiful arrangement of seasonal vegetables on top. Extra points for this. I like a little crazy vibe of the place a lot, cooks   flirting and guests singing together, amazing place for weekend dinner!"
4,"I can't say enough about this place! We had lunch there yesterday and had to go back again today!  The waiters were super friendly and spoke multiple languages. Our waiter spoke German, Italian, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The food is seriously better than a lot of the food I had in Italy!  The bruschetta, burrata, and the pizza with prosciutto and parmigiano was amazing!  They do have some funky dishes that were equally delicious if you like that sort of thing. It is very small and a bit dark inside. Sitting outside is definitely the best, but it does get packed. I would recommend going at like 12 for lunch or 6 for dinner to beat the crowds.  If you want Italian in Hamburg, this is the place to go!!"
4,"My wife and I came to this place because of the words of her friends. We had been going to another burger place in town and wanted to see how this one stacked up. We walked in and we're greeted by one of the owners. He sat us and was extremely pleasant. My wife speaks German but I don't. We sat and one of the owners took our order. The owners both spoke English which made ordering easier for me. The menu is in German, but they do a great job of explaining what is on it. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for our food to come, out come the masterpieces. We bit into them and we're immediately taken by how juicy and tasty they were. The burgers and fries were absolutely perfect !!! The toppings were fantastic, and fresh. Everything was perfect when it came to the food. As for the service, it was also top notch. The owners came around and made sure that everyone was ok and were eager to assist with any request. They went above and beyond what I would expect and am accustomed to. They make sure to take care of their customers. I intended to get their names to add to this review, but I forgot. However, I will be updating because we have found our new burger place in Hamburg. We will be returning customers. Pros : 1. The burgers are fantastic. The meat is tasty and juicy but not oily and greasy. They were cooked to perfection. 2. The fries were also cooked to perfection. Not too greasy. They were prepared just right. 3. They make these awesome cookies and cream milkshakes. They are not too heavy and taste great. And this is coming from someone who doesn't usually drink milkshakes. But these were very very very good. 4. As good as the burgers and everything else was, the service was equally as good if not better. They really take care of their customers. Being from NYC, that is something that doesn't always happen. To see such attention to that service was a pleasant surprise. Cons : (Still trying to think of one). All in all, I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I recommend anyone to check this place out. It's definitely well worth it."
3,"Pretty cool concept. Bunch of couches laying around (well, aligned perfectly, actually - It's Germany after all), a few vintage lamps lighting the place and a small bar at the end. Sat down late at night, had a few ciders and a nice convo. This one's called Zöe #2 because the lounge across the street called Zöe #1 and belongs to the same people. They look the same but we chose this one because #2 didn't serve tea (true story). Anyway, chill place to chill, A+"
3,"Awesome old-school hip-hop! I came here last night (a Monday). Though it was a bit empty, the Dj was awesome and the drinks, tasty.  Their drink menu is, impressively, extensive. Was not a fan of the cigarette smoke, but it Is Germany, so I guess it comes w/ the territory.  Very friendly bartender and ladies bathroom! If you want a chill, relaxed environment w/ great 90s music, this is your place!"
4,"As the city hall in Hamburg, it definitely make the city shines even more. The building is not only huge, historical, and also grand. It looks really different with most of the city halls I have been visit. It certainly has it own charm. I also like to check out the little detail around the building, really brilliant.In front of the city hall, the square might looks a bit dull. But there is also popular for events. From time to time, it holds different events. The city hall itself is really close to most of famous and my favourite sights in Hamburg.  From here to Alster only took around ten mins on foot, very convenient. It also got some nice cafes and restaurants. Although I have been this place already couple times, I still didn't really have a chance to pay a visit inside the building. Pity, I think, it must look as good as outside. I really like it this place. It probably is the most beautiful city hall I have seen so far in Germany."
4,Awesome German fish restaurant (try Hamburger Krebssuppe) in old town Hamburg
2,"Bon café, même en été où on peut tout obtenir dans sa version frappée. Dans la série café sans service, pour ne pas citer le nom de la chaîne que je boycotte, en voilà des sympas, en fait.Ils font de bons wraps et bagels de surcroît, le tout sans prétention. Eviter les croissants. On y rencontre la faune gentillette qui part bosser de Eimsbüttel le matin tôt puis les jeunes mères dans la matinée et les pélerins qui lisent le journal, le temps passe. Au fond, on peut apparemment consulter internet. Cartes postales gratuites à la caisse.Carte à points, le 10e est offert. Je perds ma carte à chaque fois... C'est l'intention marketing qui compte, non?"
4,Lovely little spot with excellent food. The lady there was very nice and she had an English menu which was a big help. Portions are large - we had the 3 course special and it was too much - we could have split one and it would have been plenty of food. Everything was fresh and tasty. Vegan & vegetarian options. PS - they are cash only.
4,"Great food (especially fish and seafood), great service, great location, great atmosphere  THE place for perfect dinner, be it romantic for two or family or dinner with your visitors in Hamburg. It is not cheap and little bit of touristy, but every bite is worth it."
4,"Everything is great about this restaurant. Great food, great service. Maybe i'd have wished for it to have a more open space, but on the other hand it makes it more authentic with actual ""parisien"" restaurants"
3,"This place has potential. Their service is slow, but the food is pretty good. The vegan pizzas are tasty. I think they need to work out the kinks in their delivery times, and they can be great."
3,"Super casual atmosphere and reasonable prices. I had seen the pictures of the ""Lumper Jack"" burger and just had to try it. The level of service was in top (and in English!) however, they forgot the jalapenos in my burger even tho i asked for it. The food came very soon after I'd ordered.The bun was soft and very sweet - just as it should be. The burger had soft onions, double patties with double cheese and bbq sauce. Great combo. Very tasty burger and it tasted  homemade for each bite. The fries had peel on them which is delicious but I doubt they were homemade. The dippings were def. non-homemade. If the fries had been homemade roughly cut steak fries with homemade mayo we could have achieved the last star.Overall still a great experience and I'll surely come back if I have the chance."
4,Had Bananenbrot and Vegetable Quiche with Salad yesterday. Both were so delicioussssss and of high quality. Veggies are so fresh. Quiche was just perfect. And Bananenbrot was just so yummy I had to eat in a row in 2 days. The restaurant is lovely and the staff are very nice. Highly recommended!
4,"I think this is my favourite park in Hamburg. It's huge, I've probably seen only 10% of it but it's the perfect place to be on a sunny day. It's never too crowded, not sure because of its size or because people prefer going to Elbstrand. In my opinion this is definitely a plus, since one can really do what he wishes, chill, read a book, play football, Frisbee, grill etc. without being hassled by the people around. There are even a couple of museums in the middle of it. I don't want to spoil this place too much, come and check it out in person. In my opinion this is a MUST see during summer time if you live in Hamburg."
3,"Tiny little fish place. I had a mixed plate that was quite tasty. It's very ""mom and pop"" with just one lady doing all the work. Beware you will smell like fried fish if you dine in. Great for a light meal (by German standards!) and quick too, they also have takeaway options too."
4,This was probably the best meal I ate during my two weeks in Germany! Everything was home made and there was so much attention to detail! I had spätzle with sauce and cheese and tried a dumpling with minced meat- both were outstanding! The staff were so kind and the English translated menu was perfect! I would absolutely recommend this place for an authentic German food experience!
4,"At first, we just went there for hod dogs. It was sunny outside and we were able to put ourselves in the shade to rest (because they don't have space inside). One hot dog cost only 3€ and they add sauces and toppings such as pickles and fried onions. After that, we also took ice cream which was tasty and refreshing."
3,"Solid Ethiopian place in a relatively quiet part of Ottensen. A few tables indoors, and the rest spilling out onto the sidewalk. The food is pretty tasty, but the host is the real draw. He's super-friendly, welcoming, and also speaks English pretty well.The menu is short and simple: a three-course Ethiopian menu with the option of a vegetarian or non-vegetarian platter. The main course is a platter of injera (spongy Ethiopian flat bread) topped with various stewed dishes: spinach, potatoes and cabbage, beets, chickpeas, lentils. If you order non-vegetarian, you get a chicken drumstick dish as well. The dessert was a quite good chocolate cake and a small cup of Ethiopian coffee. Despite having wine in the restaurant's name, I was surprised at how few wine options were available on the menu. That said, I had a glass of Riesling that went nicely with the meal.The only reason I'm giving four stars (and not five) is that I found the prices to be too high. Maybe I'm used to paying very little for Ethiopian food in the US, but the prix-fixe dinner surprised me at 21 Euro. It's the only Ethiopian restaurant I've visited in Hamburg, so maybe that gives them license to charge whatever they want."
4,"Yet another review to chime in, go if you can. Just remember to be patient. I am not a miniature person but the details really draw you in! Especially the little jokes and punch lines by pressing a button and hunting for the displays. There really was a lot of work and passion put into this wonderland, and that alone impressed me. Those people are truly the geek gods of Hamburg, if little else. Respect!"
1,Disappointing burger. The restaurant hat a really good rating but I wouldn't consider like a restaurant. It seems to be more like McDonald's.The burgers are okay but I would not come back here.
3,Amazing potatoes!! Definitely try the chilli and mediterranean one! The service was not the friendliest but the food is truly great and the place as such is also friendly
4,Great burgers for a really fair price. Funny and welcoming service. Definitely worth checking out! Jan bester man!!
2,"Update: Last time I was here the service was rude and so slow that we had to threaten to leave before we finally got given our tapas. My old score was 5/5. ================== This place is excellent. Best tapas I've had in Hamburg, and I've previously had some pretty good tapas. More food than we could eat + beers for five guys and the bill only came to EUR47(!) Things to definitely order:-the spicy potatoes (10 or 12 on the menu, I forget)-the chorizo (it comes flaming!)-the honey-mustard chicken-the fried cheese & ham thingys (I will learn the name) I'll definitely be back."
4,"Beautiful venue both inside and outside - has both indoor and outdoor seating, chilled out lounge area, the type of place you'd make your second home if it was your local :-) Great thin crust pizza, excellent beer selection, very reasonably priced. Seemed like a popular place to take your date on Thursday night as we were surrounded by couples. definitely will be back!"
3,"Food = awesome and that is my main motivation to come here. Service is hit or miss and when outside seating isn't possible, the berlin-hipster interior style isn't so much my thing. But if you're coming for the food, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a super hungry boy. You might need a starter then too, so I hear). Enjoy!"
3,"Cool old fashioned bar with classic cocktails on the menu. Good music, old School and new. It's low key but in stylish and chic surroundings. A perfect cocktail bar where you can relax with a drink and have cosy conversations"
2,"The Bullerei is located in a great location: a red brick building where the former slaughterhouses of Hamburg were located. This restaurant seems to get a lot of fame and attention from its celebrity TV chef Tim Mälzer, who owns it.Service was good and attentive, the food was good, but nothing special, prices are quite high for what you get. They specialize in meat, so that is maybe better, I did not have that since that costs even more.Not a must do but always a can do. The big open space all seats are in is not that cozy and inviting, for my taste.The Bullerei has a separate ""lunch"" / Deli kind of area in the front with a different menu.Will probably be back casually."
3,"The museum itself is a nice museum with a lot of interesting things, but after seeing the miniature wonderland and the maritime museum, I had more than enough miniature buildings and boats. Only was able to stay 15 minutes before I couldn't take anymore of it."
