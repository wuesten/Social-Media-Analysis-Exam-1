I chose the soy yogurt with nuts and honey, which I found in their refrigerated section. They offer two different flavors of soy yogurt. They also have quite a big and tasty looking selection of sandwiches and bagels on display. Interior is nice and welcoming, prices are moderate, some are okay others are overpriced (2€ for fruit infused water) but all in all it's a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch.",2015-09-29

Though I can't say I'm a big coffee shop sitter anymore - at least not at big, impersonal chain-type places - I figured it was worth a try.The jury's in: The new place isho-hum. Reminds me of any chain-type coffeeshop in any college town in the states. The woman behind the counter was nice, and I certainly prefer to support a student-run place over Starbuck$, but that's about it. The coffee was fine, but a bit cold and not strong enough. Mine at home is much better, as is the espresso at 'Delikatessen des Meeres' in the Colonnaden (my tip for great coffee and a great lunch, too). How about a new idea for a change?",2008-04-24

https://www.yelp.com/biz/m%C3%A9lange-hamburg,4.0,"A really nice place for Sunday brunch in Hamburg.Considering its position just a stone's throw from the Rathausmarkt and Neuer Wall, it could easily use the same tactic as nearby places such as Alex at the Alsterpavillon or Mio on Jungfernstieg where the sheer number of tourists mean that they can ramp up prices and largely ignore good service.However at Melange this doesn't seem to be the case. For the equivalent of EUR10 per person for a hungry family of four we enjoyed a large range of breads, tea, hot chocolate, meats, cheeses, scrambled egg, croissants, Schwartzbrot, a glass of prosecco. Delicious!So you can sit in one of four places; either outside alongside the water (ask for blankets if you are cold), inside on the ground floor, but recommended especially on a cold day is the inside upper floor where there is a nice buzz and friendly crowd of tourists and locals plus it has a smaller outdoor balcony too. It's actually open from 9am on Sundays (earlier than many places) and from 10.30 gets really busy so expect a slight wait after this time.On the whole the staff are friendly and efficient, speak English and were very kind to our children.",2011-10-30

https://www.yelp.com/biz/m%C3%A9lange-hamburg,4.0,"This is a new breakfast favorite. Have been coming here for some time and never wrote a review. We like sitting outside on the upstairs balcony. Great people watching as well as a great breakfast. When it's too cold we prefer sitting at the bar upstairs and eating there. The service is super nice and breakfast is pretty varied and always tasty. One argument I have is that the place tends to be a bit smoke filled if too many smokers are around. Somehow the place doesn't air out well and if there are a bunch of smoker around, we turn around and head elsewhere. Otherwise, a great place that's very central and comfortable. Great place to hit for breakfast followed by shopping in town. If you come, make sure to sit upstairs....downstairs is kinda boring and if it's nice outside, you can sit out front or upstairs on the balcony. Don't forget though that the balcony fills up real quick. They also have heating towers outside and blankets so even on colder days, the outdoor option is one to consider.",2007-10-27

The friendly waitress tending our table could only try to limit the damage. Needless to say, I shall never return to Casa di Roma. Since then (listen up, conspiracy theorists worldwide!)

https://www.yelp.com/biz/vezos-hamburg,1.0,"This restaurant has the distinction of having the rudest waiters I've ever encountered in a life of eating and traveling. I lived above this restaurant for six weks and ate there only once, my first night in Hamburg. I went in alone after having slept all day following an exhausting trip. I walked in, slightly disoriented because I expected something different than the nice surroundings. A  waiter with an overly-tailored beard approached me in English and gruffly asked me if I wanted to eat inside or out. I apparently took a few seconds too long to decide and exasperated him. ""Inside or out?"" he demanded. Only because I was famished and still exhausted did I stay. I sat in a secluded corner and was ignored for fifteen minutes, then requested service from another waiter who was busy doing something behind the bar. I wasn't happy, but too tired to leave. No takeout. Great. He then felt it necessary to lecture me that I wasn't in America when I simply offered a curious comparison to the size of the coffee cup presented. He eventually lightened up and complained that I tipped him too much. (I kept getting conflicting information about tipping in Germany). The owner did come over and ask if I liked the meal. It was just okay, but I said it was very good, other customers seemed to be having a good time. This wasn't enough. He looked at me for a moment (the stare) and didn't say anything else, then turned and left. They had an inflated opinion of the restaurant and of themselves, an arrogance similar to what I encountered often in Hamburg, but nowhere else in my travels throughout Germany and Paris this past summer. A sweet young lady smiled and said goodbye as I left, as the first waiter tried to make a point of ignoring me as he dried a plate. I really wished I had had dealings with her instead of these arrogant fools. This experience was so surprising because I had just stayed a week and a half at the Hotel  Kempinsky in Berlin where I experienced, with one exception, nothing but the absolute best service, most professional demeanors, and genuine smiles at all times.",2015-10-27

They put nice little vegetable decorations on top of all their dishes. Not sure if this is needed to be honest, as the focus for me is the taste, not the decorations on top. It was my first time here and we agreed that the curries were simply not flavorful enough and tasted like tomato paste. The Indian curry spices were just not really there. The garlic naan was the highlight however. Hot and buttery and crispy. It could have been a bit more fluffy though.

The waiter (who seemed like he must also be the manager) was friendly and got us a seat right away, tried a few jokes with our daughter, and was patient explaining the options.My wife had the cheese-filled ravioli with truffle cream sauce, which was excellent. There were seven or eight good-sized ravioli filled with some kind of firm-ish cheese, and covered in a very decadent truffle cream sauce. I ordered the daily special of chanterelles in a cream sauce over homemade papardelle; it was incredibly good. Lots of mushrooms, good portion size, and tons of flavor in every bite. Being six, our daughter ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce, and managed to eat about half of the giant ""kids"" portion (which she finished with gusto at home the next day).We also ordered tiramisu and tartufo for dessert.

But instead I'll take my duty seriously and explain the reasons for this blunt warning. Well, let's start with the ambience: this place is the epitome of a tourist trap. The (huge) restaurant is supposed to resemble some random South American village, natural stone walls, a fountain and all. Needless to say, the end result is very tacky. Let's take a look at the service now. When I visited there was literally a busload full of tourists waiting to enter, and the waiters treated them rather poorly, probably knowing that they wouldn't or couldn't leave anyway. I just felt for the poor band of folklore musicians supposed to add flair to the place - those seemed to be the only people trying to make a decent job at Panthera Rodizio. And now, finally, for the food itself: we dined á la carte instead of choosing the all you can eat option, mainly because I just wanted to spend as little money as possible at the place. What I got was a surprisingly nice piece of meat, well cooked - but the side orders were a disgrace and more akin to what you'd expect at a (1970's) motorway restaurant. The vegetables were soggy and completely overcooked, while the sauce was quite obviously courtesy of chef Maggi. All things considered, do yourself a favour and go to Block House instead.",2009-07-15

The seating was tight, the service was rude and unattentive, the place is loud in a bad way, and the food is blah. People overrate the meat here by so much. It's OK, but folks, I could do much better with my own barbecue at home. I've had much better Rodizio in much cheaper restaurants elsewhere. Drinks came wrong, stuff that was mixed such as an Alsterwasser was watered down, and requests for condiments were simply ignored. When paying, everything took way too long (technical issues suppossedly) and no one seemed to care. Service is the absolute biggest disaster at this place. I've never actually had a waiter argue with me to the extent that these clowns were willing to go. When we started, we didn't want salad. We simply wanted to get right to the meat. This wasn't allowed as I guess we were suppossed to fill ourselves with starters to eat less meat. It was also clear that they avoided coming around too often with the meat skewers so as to hold back consumption. This place is a total joke and should be avoided.",2008-03-10

Did I mention that it is also tasty and the staff is always friendly? Let me say it now.I have run through most of the menu and it is pretty tasty. It seems like the people working there are generally happy to be alive, which I appreciate.The one thing limiting my review is the quality of some of the ingredients.  I could see an upgrade in quality bringing this to the next level, and a 5 star rating, as long as the price doesn't take an exponential hike.An extra euro here or there would be fine with better quality, but I will keep coming back anyway:)",2019-06-29

A large circular tray covered with an injera base with meats, vegetables and sauces on top for a couple of people to share together in a communal style of eating. Additional injera was also brought to eat. Everything was absolutely delicious from the bean sauce to the egg, mince etc. We all ate so much that at the end of the meal we had to seat back and relax for a bit before getting up.

The view in the Hafencity area is lovely on a sunny afternoon and sets a nice mood in the evenings either for a relaxing or romantic dinner. Perhaps both! The service is warm and friendly, and if you would like to especially try a more authentic dish which is not represented on the menu, kindly communicate this to your host and if the ingredients are available, they are happy to accommodate. Being Thai myself, there are only a couple places in town where I feel I truly receive a taste of Thailand, particularly because of the nature of spiciness that is found in our food, as most European options are more mild.  I enjoyed the curries very much and rice noodle dishes such as the Pad See Ew.The decor has charm and provides a choice of floor seating or a table view near the window that looks out into the harbor neighborhood.",2012-05-10

Nice and polite service in English and/or German, no fuss when we asked for simple non-spicy food (chicken noodle stir fry) for the children and then on opting for the 3 smaller set tasting menus (one each of A, B & C) for EUR33 got a wonderful mix of truly delicious authentic food.Only downside was the cost, but I guess in this part of town ( yuppie flats, business expense lunches and cruise ship tourists) it is what it is plus the food really is very good here.So for 3 set meals, 2 childrens meals, 5 drinks + service = not much change from EUR200 !!So all in all, very nice for a special family treat (but just not that often)",2012-06-14

First: The place looks super. Very clean, nicely decorated and a fantastic view! The food I had was very good - a soup and hot chili beef. The slightly sour soup was very different from many other soups I had in Thai places...And the beef was very delicious though VERY hot. I am really accustomed to eating hotter than most other people...but that was almost too hot. So watch out when the menu says ""hot""! Service was great. Never disturbing, always nice...just like it's supposed to be. And the price was absolutely fine for what I got (might be different in the evening, though).

No one went the extra mile and it was default all night. Lots of people have already spoken well of the location and ambiance. I'd say it's good but not outstanding. There are better views of the harbor as well as in the Hafencity. Finally, I found the bathrooms to not be that clean. I was already there pretty late in the evening but if you are going to charge these prices, make sure someone is regularly keeping the washrooms tidy. I probably wouldn't go back, mostly due to the pricing for average Thai food. It's worth checking out though if you must do something in the Hafencity and you like Thai.

This place is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a foodie, you have to check it out. If you're not a foodie, you should still check it out. The reviews are super impressive and very well deserved, and popular with the locals it is. Always a great sign, right?Ok, so here's the deal: you enter the space down a few stairs from the street level. You order your dish and a drink at the counter. The place is made up of a pretty cramped connection of tiny rooms with only a few tall tables around. Some with stools. Most without. But in pleasant weather, the great majority of folks are outside on the open sidewalk umbrella-covered tables that are pretty much full of people either enjoying their food or waiting for their food. When they have a bunch of dishes ready, they put them out on the counter and ring a bell. What? No, I'm not kidding. Then a bunch of customers just swoop right in and grab their dishes. Apparently everyone is a regular and already knows the drill, but I still have no idea how people know who gets what or when that bell ring is for them or not. Just bizarre, but it certainly seems to work. These are very happy diners, for sure. Luckily for me, the counter-lady was really sweet and clued in this rather clueless American when my dish was included in which bell ringing round.I had ordered the seafood lasagna w/carpaccio. Sounded amazing, and it certainly was. OMG. Happy me! Delic!! Lovely fresh pasta and veggies in a somewhat deconstructed lasagna style with a lot of yummy broth. Somewhat soupy. Just fantastic. The other dish available that day was a swordfish with potatoes on a bed of greens. Looked amazing and appeared to be the most popular. The Chef creates the menu each day of only 1 or 2 dishes, based on the freshest ingredients available in the markets that day. Brilliant! Simple concept. Simple food. Nothing fancy. Just fantastically prepared super fresh big plates of homey food. Everyone brings out their own flatware/napkin/drink to their tables, picks up their own dish from the counter when ready, and self-busses and drops off their dirty plates when they're done.

Because the crust is so thin, the margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella) is probably my favorite. They have chili oil available, which I usually put on to give it a little kick. I've tried a bunch of the other pizzas, too, and they're good, too. They also have a handful of pasta options, which I've tried a few times. By far my favorite pasta is the linguine aglio, olio, e scampi (garlic, oil, and shrimp), which comes with a heap of arugula on top, and just a really great flavor overall. There are soft drinks, wines by the glass and bottle, and beer on tap. A few of their wines by the glass are excellent, and reasonably priced. I always get the feeling that I'm being slightly overcharged at Die Pizzeria, but I think that's just the Eppendorf surcharge (everything is probably 20% more expensive than it should be).

Were these resolved they easily get 5 stars. One is the fact that they have a ventilation system which is necessary to keep the place from stinking like the kitchen. At the same time, this creates a draft on half the seats which really isn't something you want. We had to change seats in the hope of not waking up the next day with sore necks. Luckily we received a table upstairs and had the whole level to ourselves which was very much to our liking. Second complaint is the wine pricing. By the glass, you only get 0,1 servings at prices which are usually for 0,2 size servings. Not a major big deal but still kind of high for the rest of the menu's very positive notes. There is also a 0,25 size serving but for two people this is also poor sizing. Anyway, these were very minor complaints on my end. On a very positive note service here is great. Super nice waitress who was more than attentive the whole evening and very helpful in making choices off the menu. We both had the pasta with truffles which was really good. Further, and I usually wouldn't comment on this, the bread served was amazing. Super tasty and warm which when eaten with the high quality olive oil rounded out our meal nicely. We also had dessert and were very impressed. We ordered the pistachio tarte and the chocolate tart which were both filled with creamy fillings. Dessert was the highlight of the meal. The interior is still, after being open a year, like new. I really like the mix of styling and it's a very comfortable atmosphere (outside of the draft). We'll definitely be back soon as this could easily become a favorite Italian place in the Innenstadt.

They do a special with coated nan with some sort of pizza sauce, all wrapped cylindrically, so you can eat it length-ways. This is important as any kebab-lover can attest. This monster will set you back EUR 3.70, although there are cheaper options, including a kebab with chips actually in it. I must try this. They also sell beer as everywhere here, and the staff are funny, so give it a go.",2007-08-16

It's a small restaurant tucked into the basement of a hotel.The service is nice. There's one server to cover all of the tables, but with a limited number of tables, the workload is manageable. My server was really nice and helped translate the menu to English for me.After placing my order, I waited a painfully long time for my food. From the time I sat down to the time my food came, 60 minutes had elapsed. Painful!The food was good, though I found some bones in my fish. The person who prepped the fish should be more careful. But yum, that crispy skin was good.Lentils under the fish were a little salty (like a lot of food in Germany), but good. The mashed potatoes were good, but some chunks were too big.I had a glass of house wine that was also good, but I admit that I'm no connoisseur.I liked the feel, the food was good, and I want to support small businesses, but they have to fix the wait time issue.",2016-03-10

We grabbed a couple of seats at a communal table, and although it was really tight in there, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. You order at the counter, and they bring your food to the table.I had the masamun curry with red rice, which was a huge portion (see photo) and very satisfying. It had big chunks of pumpkin, sweet potato, and eggplant, and came in a pretty spicy (in a good way) red coconut milk curry sprinkled with green onions, parsley, and peanuts. It's one of the best plates of food I've eaten in Hamburg; I was really blown away.My wife had the quiche, which, because it was vegan, she said was mostly potatoes and sweet potatoes. It was a large slice, and came with a side salad. She was also very satisfied.We split a peanut butter cookie for dessert, which I'm guessing was also vegan, but was soft and delicious like a normal (butter-laden) peanut butter cookie.I would absolutely recommend this place for a casual and hearty lunch, whether you're vegan or not.

Rent a canoe from Saarlandstraße, pack your picnic, beers and cricket set and paddle down the river into the Stadtpark lake. Strip down to your shorts, and jump over board.

There was some mad stat in the UK recently about the % of people who had never swum in natural water. They need to check this out: wildswimming.co.uk  So, drag yourself on to shore, set up the cricket set and the beers, and prepare for the perfect afternoon. The germans wont have any idea what's going on, and will stroll across the wicket, staring bemusedly at the angry English man wafting his bat around. What is almost guaranteed is that you'll get some friendly Indian, Bangladeshy, Afghan, Australian or yesterday, West Indian come up and have a go at bowling you out. The streets of the West Indies are a fertile home for spin bowling as I found out yesterday! The streets of Afghanistan are a fertile home for some super fast bowling as I also found out last year.

Interior design is, of course, a matter of personal taste, but (M)eatery's rather cool interior rather didn't appeal to mine. Service was swift and friendly, so a (M)eatery Deluxe Burger was ordered quickly. The burger was explained at length in the menu as a very elaborate and distinguished piece of meaty cuisine, so my expectations were rather high. For a price of EUR 18 one gets a beef burger with shallots, home made chips and Wasabi mayonnaise. One even has the choice of different kinds of rolls. Regrettably, what came out of the kitchen didn't warrant the rather lengthy and somewhat pretentious explanation in the menu. First of all my burger had been cooked very medium instead of medium rare (as I'd ordered it); the Wasabi mayonnaise is plain silly, as its very dominant taste simply doesn't suit this kind of dish. But worst of all were the chips, which were very soggy and fatty indeed. Still feeling a bit hungry I, somewhat cynically, ordered soufflé for desert, wondering if the kitchen could actually handle such a delicate dish.

The food is good but completely overpriced. It lacks the nice spicy taste of asian cuisine and it is not very traditional. Also I've noticed some Vietnamese restaurants have started adding onion crumbs into their buns (yeah those you add to hot dogs and other junk food). Unfortunately my dish had that unwanted ingredient. Until this point I had already thought of giving the place a solid three stars; however, the dish was full of hairs and eye lashes which cost them a good rating.SERVICE:Slow, careless and unfriendly. Unfortunately these are the first words that come to mind after eating here. The waiter was way too serious and rather unhelpful. Showed no patience and just wanted to get the job done. Also although we were initially alone in the restaurant it took forever for them to take our order, bring our food and later to take our card. A change in attitude (or staff) might help this restaurant improve its service. LOCATION: Hoheluftchaussee is one of Hamburg's nicest places to go out for dinner.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/ballinstadt-auswanderermuseum-hamburg,3.0,"Welcome to the Auswanderermuseum BallinStadt in Hamburg aka museum about emigrantion.First of all: I will not join the overall praise for this museum. Now, 3 days after I visited it, I still think the quality of the exhibition is pretty mixed.I visited it with friends, both fluent in English and German, and we switched languages depending on which seemed to get us quicker through, because the museum was pretty crowded on the day of our visit.We both had intermediate to advanced knowledge of German history and emigration waves from Germany. I don't know how much you would get our of the exhibition if you are just searching for information where your ancestors are from. That's because the exhibition is pretty inconsistent. Albeit, the general layout makes sense: Situation in Germany and Eastern Europe  Migration waves  Destinations - the development of the ships and the ship passage  Entering the new country (with a special focus on Ellis Island)  Immigration Countries other than the USA/Canada (Brazil, Australia)  famous immigrants who've made it.In another building the history of the BallinStadt is told, with the situation which led to the building of the barracks, their short-lived fate from 1901-1914 and the seemingly even shorter time between WW I and WW II. Plus the story about the back-then CEO of HAPAG, the shipping company that invented ship cruises and got big by shipping immigrants over the Big Pond.About the flaws in the concept:English vs. German:Everything is labelled in English in German, but the German label dominate, the English is always a bit shorter and layouted in a smaller font.Bigger picture vs. individual story:In the beginning you are confronted with six individuals, which should guide you through the exhibition and tell you their story. They literally tell you their story, which might be longer with the one and quicker with the other. Unfortunately you cannot skip  when you dialled the wrong language, you have to wait until they are finished. On crowded days, you have to stand in line, there are only two earphones per puppet, and you can dial only one language at a time for both earphones.And in the end you find out the six individuals don't really guide you through. You just see them back at the end of the exhibition, then they tell you what their life is like not that they are away from home for a couple of month or years. There is no alternative way to find out about their fate, you either wait and here or you don't find out about them.During the different stages of the migration, there are different individuals who show up and just present one piece of information, you don't get informed what their background is, et cetera. So if they already put such an efford in telling an individual's story, why don't they use it to describe the different stages of emigration better?History of BallinStadtThere is a lot of pictures and exhibition objects which are not labelled, and you might only get the meaning of it later on, if you get it.Conclusion:Ok, we learned a lot, and I think for kids it might be funny to run through a ship which changes from early 18th century to early 20th century within a few meters. But there is a lot that is forbidden to touch (not a good idea with kids). The fact that a lot of exhibition objects are not labelled and you might learn to know what it was waaayyy later is annoying.The entrance fee is 12 EUR, which is not cheap. As the museum is not publicly funded, it is heavily sponsored, f.e. by Ancestry.com. This is a bit ironic, because the digitalization of the archieves is publicly funded, so it is a strange kind of private-public partnership.",2012-10-07

https://www.yelp.com/biz/viale-antico-hamburg,1.0,"The Viale Antico was a nice little Italian place that we used to frequent on a regular basis. Unfortunately due to multiple circumstances I'm now re-classifying it as a 1 star restaurant. It may well be a victim of it's own success. They've got a lot more customers now, but no more staff. In fact they have less staff, and they've put the prices up! The waiters are generally incompetent. Today we were seven people. The first two meals came, then we waited 5 minutes for the next two. We had to wait a further 20 minutes for the last three, while repeating our order for three separate waiters. When the last three were finally ready they were sitting on the counter for a few minutes with no-one to bring them over, so one of the chefs motioned to us that we should just pick them up ourselves If this was the first time that I'd had such a bad experience I'd let it pass, but they were almost as bad the last time (1 month ago). I just can't let it pass. The food is still decent, but it's definitely not worth the experience that comes with it.",2007-12-18
https://www.yelp.com/biz/viale-antico-hamburg,4.0,"Looks like I'm going to have to go ahead and edit my review again, bringing Viale Antico back up to 4 stars. The service seems to have gone back to it's original, snappy self - I guess last summer wasn't a good time for them. Their prices, however, have remained higher than they originally were. I haven't gone back with a large party so I'm not sure how they'll handle more than a few people, but I've been coming here once a week with one or two lunch-mates and the service has been friendly and snappy. I like that at Viale Antico I can order whatever I want - regardless of if it's on the menu or not - and I can ask for any modifications of menu items. --- ORIGINAL EDIT --- Unfortunately I'm going to have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant to two stars. In the past few months, the quality of service has dropped dramatically and the prices of the dishes have increased. More times than not, two or more of our party have been receiving their dish considerably later (up to 40min) than the rest of us and the staff has been rude to us, which provides for an uncomfortable and nerve-wrecking lunch experience. At this point in time I cannot recommend Bistro Viale Antico. --- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW --- Bistro Viale Antico is across the street from the new Qype HQ on Deichstrasse. We strolled upon it accidentally this afternoon as a part of our lunch-hour-wander, to find restaurants in the area. I ordered the Scampi pasta, which was probably one of the better Scampi pastas I've had. Most other restaurants drench the spaghetti in sauce and throw in a few scampis. The pasta I received had a very light garlic/butter sauce with fresh herb seasoning and had plenty of scampi. The price was reasonable. 7.50eu is what I paid for my dish, which is higher than I'm accustomed to, but the quality of the service and food was much higher than I am accustomed to, as well.",2007-12-18

Service back to it's good old self, and seem to get free wine everytime. I'm back in love. UPDATE 9/7/08 My my, how things change in the space of a few months! Firstly the 'summer pricing' - to make sure the tourists of historic Deichstrasse pay more, then the service... which has been steadily decreasing in quality for months, till it hit rock bottom today. Yes, I had probably the worst lunch experience of all my lunch experiences in Hamburg thus far! Seven of us sat down to eat, and 2 dishes arrived after maybe 15 minutes. Another 2 after 25 minutes, and the last three? A whopping 45 minutes after! I might add the fact that I had to get these myself from the kitchen, or that my cutlery was literally thrown down onto the table when I asked for some... but you don't need to know all that. I already warned 3 people off on the way in - now I'm telling you Qypers - don't eat here, ever! ****************Well being as it's opposite work, I do eat here a lot!

It tasted far better than standard, however! The galette was perfectly cooked, just a little bit crispy on the outside. The ham, egg, and cheese combination was already really good, but the toppings were all surprisingly tasty as well. Each was flavored a little bit differently and the combination of flavors (plus the crispy galette) worked really, really well.The atmosphere is like sitting in a cafe in France, so you might get a little confused about where you're located in the world!

The menu crêpe was chocolate and coconut.So the food is really tasty, and I even want to go back for it. Why 3 stars you ask? Service. This restaurant is so incredibly slow. Yesterday it didn't look too busy, but it took us one hour and 15 minutes from our arrival to our departure.

A quick pop of the Yelp app and we found ourselves at Ti Breizh devouring gorgeous crepes within a few minutes. Now, this was midday on a Sunday -- it obviously gets very busy and is very popular, so typically reservations are recommended. This Breton-inspired, white wash wood interiored gem was just what we needed after a long night and heavy morning of walking. I chose the Nordic savoury crepe with loads for smoked salmon and fresh dill. Mmmmm, so nice. Served with a nice side salad. Though we weren't toting our toddler, it did some very kid friendly (at this hour anyway) with several children at most of the tables near us. Kid chairs available and by nature, crepes are very child approved! There's a small shop in the front selling clothing that fits the theme (ALL stripes), unfortunately they closed before I could finish eating so I didn't get a chance to peek around. I likely would've bought something, too. 5-stars easily -- sometimes there is a reason a place is so popular, and the reason at Ti Breizh is because it is fantastic.

I ordered a Salmon, Spinach and Tomato savory crepe. It took a while to get but it was very delish. The salmon was a bit salty but very flavorful. I went for a sweet crepe (sugar and lime) and that was even better than the savory option.My recommendation is for you to stick to the sweet options if you decide to check it out.

The friendly and quick staff are even more original in their ""French coast"" vibes and striped clothing than those in Brittany itself, I would say??The food is really good: authentic, rich, buttery; nice cheese and a host of other toppings, and not too pricey. They don't serve the most fancy types of galette (like scallops etc.), so no dish is above 10€. (Keep in mind thought that no galette dinner is complete without a bottle of cidre and a crepe for dessert. This is not health food you came here for.

The waiter was also very patient with me, even bringing a bottle of the buckwheat beer they had to the table so I could check if it was gluten free (it's not :(). They also let me have any of the sweet crêpe types with a buckwheat base!

Brown sugar, maple syrup, chocolate, ice cream, whipped cream, apple sauce - if you can think it, Ti Breizh make it. Granted, this is probably not the best place to go with a large party, as the kitchen is only capable of making 4 galettes/crepes at a time and it will take the food a little longer to arrive to a big table, and the prices aren't the cheapest in the area.

Thankfully the burgers are the same price as everywhere else. I should mention for those unfamiliar with the Jim Block franchise that they're a sort of classier fast-food burger joint. You get a real plate and cutlery and you can choose a beer as part of the meal-deal. The burgers are better than standard fast food burgers, and the fries are pretty decent too. If you want a quick burger I'd recommend this place. However, in the context of Jim Block restaurants, this one is super-busy. They don't seem to have any more staff though, and do the service really suffers. Last night there were 5 staff and only 2 people ahead of me in the line, but it still took me 10 minutes to get served.

When I did finally manage to find a day which wasn't completely packed (Saturday night, surprisingly), I ordered a veggie burger and was somewhat disappointed. See, when I think of veggie burger, I think of a vegetable-based patty inside a bun. Jim Block's idea of a veggie burger is to throw a handful of mushrooms inside the bun and call it a burger, which we all know is blasphemy. One star off the rating for this obvious abomination.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/jimmy-elsass-hamburg,3.0,"Jimmy Elsass is supposedly the number one location to satisfy one's Tarte Flambée cravings in Hamburg. After having heard of this almost legendary venue for years I finally got around to actually visiting it - and was just a wee bit underwhelmed. The interior is decorated in typical students pub style (which is supposed to be no distinct style at all) - lime green walls, old fashioned seats, dim lighting and oversized plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling (and hence obstructing the way for taller guests). Some might find it charming and genuine, I however wouldn't mind a bit more polish here and there, especially as prices aren't exactly cheap. And this leads me to my main criticism: Tarte Flambée is an exceptionally cheap dish to produce, which is why I find a price range starting from six Euros a bit overconfident. That isn't to say the actual taste wasn't good, because it was - the base was crispy and light, though it could have done with more generous topping (and maybe more hearty bacon). But I generally don't like it when a restaurant's profit margins are as obvious as is the case at Jimmy Elsass'. The dessert menu also offers a sweet Tarte Flambée with apple and almonds ""flambé-ed"" with Calvados. It sounded intriguing, but actually wasn't all that nice, as the alcohol's taste was a bit too dominant and made the Tarte's base very soggy indeed. I'd avoid it in the future. Which isn't something I'd say of Jimmy Elsass in general - the place's got a focused menu with decent, if overpriced offerings.

It is a bit out of the way to reach if you do not have a car, as the nearest public transportation by train is Landungsbrücken or taking a bus (112) along the Elbechausse. Once you arrive, the place is neatly organized, however due to lack of space and popularity of its infamous reputation, they pack tables in a bit too tightly. It is one great room with everyone lined up so closely, I can hear my neighbor chewing their salad.  Not a good seating situation for the claustrophobic, however, the food is so nice and service impeccably attentive, that one easily forgives the spacial limitations and enjoys the intimacy of the surroundings instead. All sushi is delicious, I mean, really. If you love sushi, order by favorite ingredients, as we all have our personal favorites that we crave consistently, but if feeling more adventurous, one can do no wrong here. Fresh, tasty, exotic rolls, that satisfy.You pay for sushi quality, so expect a reasonably pricey bill at the end of your meal, particularly if you are the type to go Rambo like myself and order with big eyes and a curious stomach :)  When sushi is of a higher caliber of quality, I often opt for sashimi, so not to waste my low carb diet on rice and extra sauces when the fish alone tastes marvelous enough with a spot of low sodium soy sauce and swipe of wasabi for good measure, topped with a ginger garnish! Sehr Lecker...If with a friend, do some fresh light appetizers, order a variety platter, and a bottle of Riesling, followed up with a warm chocolate dessert if available.  You will leave feeling like you just fell from sushi heaven.  I normally take in this experience with a friend, when we feel like having a nice, quiet, special sushi dinner away from the Mitte madness.My only complaint?

https://www.yelp.com/biz/piment-hamburg,4.0,"Just in terms of the art of plating, this restaurant is easily in the top 10 of all time that I have ever dined at or experienced. Every dish was exceptionally photo-worthy, from multiple angles, and literally compelled you to take out your smartphone and photograph it. Simply put, our dinner was art on a plate. The food here also had many different flavor profiles and flavor combinations that would test the range of many people's palettes. The cuisine is French-Moroccan. Some could easily find it odd or mis-matched. I appreciated it because it was something new and often had me saying ""hmmm...interesting...good, but very different.""Seven courses per person were a bit on the pricey side -- moths flew out of my wallet after I paid the bill -- but it was a wonderful celebration dinner that night, all in all, for multiple reasons.If you really want to taste something a little bit different, bold, new or refreshing, where the food is beautifully plated, then this is the place.",2015-08-04
https://www.yelp.com/biz/piment-hamburg,4.0,"My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner - first birthday in Hamburg! I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience here. Located in the lovely neighborhood of Eppendorf, the restaurant is situated on a street near other shops and restaurants, but it's not super bustling. The setting is great for a nice intimate dinner for two or with a few friends.You get two tasting menu options for 108€. The differences in the menus are slight, with the first course and last course being different, otherwise all dishes in between are the same. We went with Nouri's Menu (that's the chef). The courses included the following:1. Foie Gras 2. Tartar of Beef 3. Couscous with 7 vegetables4. Monkfish5. Nouri's main course - braised ox6. Almond foam with mint granité and apricot7. Roses sorbetAll courses were plated beautifully! Each course was also bursting with flavor and the flavor combinations were quite interesting. I was definitely able to detect all the Moroccan influences. In regards to the food, I wouldn't say it was the best Michelin star meal I've had, but it's near the top of my list for overall experience, especially for presentation.

We felt the rock-vibe much more than we once felt at a normal table.I don't understand why people are complaining, but that may be because we went there in the late evening (around 21 o'clock) and got the full blast of hard rock or just plain rock. I don't see why people are offended by the music.And the people at the tables should be more realistic ... they do have two floors and only have a limited amount of staff.

It opened at 12pm however we got there about 2 minutes before and waited behind the red rope. They didn't actually open the doors till about 12:05pm and even when they did that they were very slow with letting people in.We did ask ahead of time for a reservation but were told they do not take any at this time but in a few weeks. Our party of 18 got to the door and was offered to come into the bar area and wait for a few minutes till they arrange some tables for us. We had requested to sit outside on the roof but were told it was not open this day. Strange considering they push the fact they have this great roof deck and it was a really great summer day!!Finally after about 5 minutes of waiting inside we were seated upstairs in the Jimmy room. It was quite hot and this could have something to do with the fact it is located near the kitchen?? Our party of 18 was separated into 2 tables, each having their own server.We ordered our drinks promptly and received them a few minutes later. As soon as we received our drinks we ordered our meals. The server was obviously not familiar with the menu yet and we had to constantly point to the menu for her to read even though we spoke German to her.After about 1.5 hrs the food started to come out. However, it was coming out in spurts. A couple plates, waiting a few minutes, then a couple more. It then came down to the last 2 plates, (mine and another persons). After another 10 minutes his plate came and I was told mine was coming. In fact I had 3 different people come over and tell me it was coming. I was then given a plate of cold fries to keep me satisfied till it arrived.When it finally came, everyone else had already finished. I then asked for a box so I could just take it with me and was told it was not possible as they do not have take away boxes but she would ask anyway. While she was away I noticed the food on my plate was not resembling what I had ordered. I looked around and then asked for a menu and sure enough it was not what I ordered. I showed this to the server and instead of telling me she was sorry she just told me it was correct. I told her to please take it back and we would take the check.Another fact, we never got an apology from anyone. They did take off the cost of my food but that was it. Clearly this location is not yet fully up and running as it should be.I have been to many and the service and food is excellent. It should also be noted that the prices of the menu seem to be higher then the other locations as well.

I ended up going either the potato soup, which was a welcome surprise because it was served in a small pot with a little candle underneath. We also went with potato pancakes as a starter. The pancakes were crispy and served with sweet jam that made them a better dessert than starter but they were great, none the less. The only reason my review is 4 stars and not 5 is that Kartoffelkeller was a bit expensive for having a potato heavy menu.

We were so thirsty after walking all around the city that we would have maxed out our credit card just on Cokes alone. The waiter kept bringing us carafes full of plain tap water and glasses for no charge - for that alone they have my eternal gratitude!I had the ""Florentiner Spinatauflauf"" - a florentine spinach and potato casserole. Along with the spinach and potato slices in a garlic cream sauce it was also covered in cheese and baked. It was incredibly good. My son had a variety of roasted potatoes and potato pancakes. I forgot what my wife and daughter ate, but it was also very good. We sat outside on the patio on account of the nice weather. Inside was very cozy and dark. Take your pick depending on your mood.If you love potatoes as much as we do, you should definitely try this place. They proudly make potatoes the centerpiece of everything!",2015-06-18
https://www.yelp.com/biz/kartoffelkeller-hamburg,3.0,"We ate at Kartoffelkeller on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The restaurant is on a very picturesque street in Hamburg, right on the water. The concept of a potato themed restaurant intrigued us so we decided to give it a shot. There weren't many other patrons in the restaurant since we were late for lunch so we were seated right away.  The decor seemed a bit dated and it seems like a place that gets a lot of business from tourists--which isn't a bad thing but you could tell the place needed a little ""freshening-up.""I had the Hamburger Pannfisch and the husband had potato pancakes and the potato soup with sausage. Both of our meals weren't particularly spectacular but they weren't horrible either. We came away satisfied so we consider that a win.

Very disappointing. The place itself is very cool, but... the final thing that did it for me was seeing a mouse run by the table. The place has dark lighting which is probably why most people did not see it. I told the server and he said that it was normal as they are located in a basement and surrounded by water. When I saw the mouse a second time, it had returned from the other side of the dinning room and was very close to our table. I decide we'd had enough. I asked for the bill and they not only provided zero discounts, but the serve had the audacity to point out that tips had not been charged on the bill. I simply paid (NO tips) and decided to never return..",2018-12-30

https://www.yelp.com/biz/kartoffelkeller-hamburg,1.0,"We made a reservation for 6 people at 6pm. We arrived and from the beginning, the female server had a major attitude. Everything we said she had to roll her eyes at us and shrug her shoulders. In fact, one of the people in our party asked for a dark beer and she replied: ""I don't know."" Again, my colleague asked for the darkest, heavier beer they had and rolling her eyes she said ""Pilsner"". If you know German beer, that is as light beer as it gets; so she recommended the total opposite. I lived in Germany and was letting it slide. She kept with the attitude while we order our food. Some of the members in my party have never been there and asked a few questions about the menu. She just kept acting as we were a waste of her time. When she asked me for my choice, I finally said to her: ""are you ok?"" And she, rolling her eyes one again, said: ""Ja, why?"" And I finally said, ""because since we walked in this restaurant you have had a very sarcastic and nasty attitude and you can now drop it."" She was in shock that I confronted her. After she walked away, the members of my party said: ""I thought it was me who noticed and attitude but I did not want to say anything."" But I did. And here is the deal: The server does not know that some if the members in my dinner party come to Hamburg every week, sometimes 4 to 5 times a month with different colleagues from work and we recommend to each other places to eat. In fact, I thought the food was quite mediocre and I've had much better Germany food in other locations nearby.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/kartoffelkeller-hamburg,5.0,"Kartoffel Keller! I loved everything about this restaurant. At first glance, Kartoffel Keller looks like any other restaurant from the front. That is, until you realize that it's actually in the basement! Open the old door and be greeted with plenty of old world deco. They use waxy candles that melt over a wine bottle and by the look at the wax, they only use candle light. The ambiance is a bit dark but it's fitting. On to the food! I love potatoes. I love everything about potatoes and this restaurant specializes in potatoes! The translation of Kartoffel Keller is Potato Cellar. I went straight to the potato salads because I love German potatoes salads back home. There were types I have never seen nor heard of before so I went for the one that was that sounded the most unique. Potato salad with young herring, onions, beet root and apple slices. Everything in the salad was excellent. The sauce was a bit more watery then you'd find back home but it helped coat all the pieces nicely. The onions added a nice spicy bite. The potatoes were a little bitey which is exactly how I like them. I ordered the potato stew with sausage for the main course. It was very filling. It's served in a pot hanging over a tea light candle to keep it warm. The stew consistency was a little thin for what I would call stew, but the taste was there. There was some ground sausage in it with some cased sausage as well. Both were excellent. Since it was almost Christmas, I had to order the Gluhwein. It was very well done as well. The spices weren't over powering and it was just sweet enough to overcome the winey vapor you get from hot wine. Combine the ambiance with the food and the price, this place is a winner in my book.

It's the kind of place that I can imagine has been here for years, and like a certain bar in Boston, everyone might just know your name.The atmosphere is nice, the service is friendly, and the food is edible, but none of it seems to come together into a cohesive dining experience for me.On one visit I had the Seelachs (pollack?) with potato salad, and on another visit I had the Wiener Schnitzel with white asparagus, potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. The fish was decent, but the Wiener Schnitzel was unremarkable, and the asparagus was overcooked.I suspect Borchers is a great place to sit outside and drink beer on a warm day, but the food is just not that good.",2016-04-27

I have to say the outside looks a bit circumspect, but I noticed that every table outside was taken, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. We sat by a window table inside instead, which was actually as good as being outside but not as cold, and had the filet steak, and a (forgive my spelling) schnitzel. The food wasn't bad at all, the service was great, and the beer was nice too. So all in all, it's not bad!

It's never too crowded, not sure because of its size or because people prefer going to Elbstrand. In my opinion this is definitely a plus, since one can really do what he wishes, chill, read a book, play football, Frisbee, grill etc. without being hassled by the people around. There are even a couple of museums in the middle of it. I don't want to spoil this place too much, come and check it out in person.

No outdoor seating.  They don't need to be trendy, they are intimate and the food speaks for itself (in both a classic and classy way without attitude). I was brought bread with butter and a salt shaker to start. To begin I chose the cold roast beef with fried potatoes and not sure what dressing but oh wow ! Even at this stage it's clear that if I lived locally I would be a regular. This is where you bring a date to impress her (if she's a foodie) trust me it will impress! As I wait for my main I try another piece of bread yes, the salt does enhance the flavour. Also my very attentive waitress steps outside and charmingly slouches against the door frame to peruse the street for a moment before turning and coming back in. I really really like it here! I know I'm not writing a novel here but as I sip my German rose while sitting alone it's impossible not to drink in the atmosphere. The wine is delicious btw. Esp in this humid heat. My main was essentially Fish w beets but the menu listing was more eloquent.  When I was having trouble deciding on my main. When I asked her favourite the waitress said she liked this item because of its freshness. Very apt.  I'm not stopping there. (Btw I Never do 3 courses of dinner!) As I sit here enjoying my own thoughts I notice the couple in the (frosted) window table holding hands. Take note men, That's where you want to sit with your romantic dates. Dessert, well I'm not really a fan I just got carried away. The chocolate sauce and vanilla custard I think it was Accompanying were really delicious. The Tort was nice. Just not really my thing.

Chickpeas aren't my favorite, so I don't know why I ordered this side, and I thought they were decent but not amazing (I enjoyed the tomato sauce).The tzatziki sauce was excellent (very flavorful), and I really enjoyed this along with the humus, which tasted great as a dip for the pita and falafel.

After passing by some other Yelp recommendations, I finally decided to take the train out here before checking out the St. Pauli Christmas Market nearby. It's about a 5-7 minute walk from the train stop.Arriving in the evening, the place was packed. As in, every single seat was taken. I tried to seat myself at the bar, only to be informed that I still had to put my name down because there were slots of reservations. No biggie. I was fine waiting. Except it seemed like I waited for half an hour or more as I watched groups of people walk in and get seated without reservations. Turns out the hostess thought I was also waiting for a dining companion to arrive thus the multiple snubs. Well, that tells you something about going out to eat by yourself at restaurants here. Rare stuff.Anyway, I finally got to sit at the bar and already having familiarized myself with the menu--there is an awesome disclaimer on the front page about what to expect with their food and how to eat it--I ordered a burger, fries, and beer. It was a hefty portion and the interestingly English-muffin-like bun was tiny compared to the patty, but a decent American-esque meal. Service was fine. Given the crowds, the popularity of The Bird speaks for itself. It's a good place to eat some good food and for the locals to get a taste of the stateside stuff.

The burgers are also served with a generous amount of tasty fries.My rules to adhere to when dining here: if it's too crowded then leave (unless you don't mind waiting a long time to get your food), but if it's not too bad and you can easily find a seat, then you should really dine here.",2015-04-29

When visiting...Hamburg, my friend and I thought it'd be fitting to have...a hamburger, in Hamburg. An acquaintance recommended this place, and they were right - it was great. The atmosphere is like a hip Mexican hipster cantina, despite no Mexican food. There are old punk records over the bar and really friendly bartenders. We didn't have a reservation, so we had to sit at the bar, which was fine. We each had beers and I had a burger (something Texan) with an egg on it (I love eggs on anything) and my friend had a cheeseburger. The burgers themselves are HUGE, and were perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. They fell apart and were very juicy. The weirdest thing is that the burgers come on *English muffins*. I had experienced that before with a good burger in Seattle at brunch recently, but..it was a bit odd. I think the burger would have held together a bit better with a sturdier bun, but, it makes the place unique. I'll surely revisit this place when craving a burger in Hamburg again.

There was plenty of room at the bar so it was easy for us to find seats. Immediately we looked at their chalkboard for their angry hour specials. Hehe, not happy but angry hour. There was a special for buy one get one free for the tap beer which we obviously ordered. Then we saw napalm wings for 25 cents each. We love hot wings so we of course did a half order of that. For the burgers, I went with a plain one as the burgers looked pretty massive and there was plenty of mayo and ketchup on the bar top for me to sauce it up if I needed to.For our drinks we ordered a couple rounds of the ratsheern red beer. It's a good light beer and I needed a couple of glasses once the napalm wings came around. When we ordered the napalm wings, our waitress warned us that it was spicy, we said. 'ja, we know'. Then she proceeds, 'No, IT'S REALLY SPICY!"" lol We were foolish and said, 'ja we like spicy!'. The waitress said ok.... and out came the wings! They were in a dry habanero sauce with a side of blue cheese dressing and some carrots. We took one bite and our lips were on fire. ok yeah.... napalm wings are REALLY SPICY! The flavor of the wings were still really good but I think I cried a little! So be careful when ordering the wings. It's a great deal when they are 25 cents but I'm really glad we only had 3 each. I could not finish 6 or a dozen!Ok, as my mouth was on fire, my burger arrived with a heaping pile of fries. I dove into the fries and couldn't really taste anything but burning. After the napalm wings heat subsided, I finally was able to eat my burger which was really juicy and delicious! I love how the english muffin soak up the burger flavor and I was able to eat the whole thing without a fork and knife :) Overall, it's a great place for great messy burgers!

We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar without a reservation and the place was absolutely packed the whole time. Heed the warning in the menu: this burger truly takes its damn time. We waited almost AN HOUR to receive food after ordering. Strangely, other people sitting at the bar got their food at the same time even though they arrived 30 minutes after us. That's the only reason the Bird doesn't get 5 stars. However, the servers were nice and the beers are big and they serve decent cider as well, so that took up our time. When we actually got the burger, I was ravenous. I'm happy to say that it was delicious and juicy and the HUGE medium rare patty was more like rare; very pink inside! I was in meaty bliss for the next 20 minutes. I opted for the Ghetto Deluxe with an egg and was about to order fries as well but our server kindly stopped me, bringing my attention to the fact that each burger comes with fries. And it is a lot of fries! They are crispy outside and creamy inside. And I was skeptical about using an english muffin for a bun but it worked out very well; keeping the burger structurally intact while soaking up all the yolk and meatjuice in the nooks and crannies. Also appreciated is the fact that they put the condiments right in front of you, and they have Tapatio! I don't like it when restaurants give me a tiny container of ketchup with my food.. I know it is a stereotype that Americans love ketchup but I'm afraid I have to propagate it; give me my damn ketchup.

Long-story short, the place has come into its own. It's still a bit generic, hence only four instead of five stars. There is a bunch of new waitstaff so I guess they dumped people who were not up to par and have finally found people who'll stick around for a bit. We had great service again so happy on that front. I've basically only been here with guy friends (my g/f is just not into it) and everyone is always pleasantly surprised. Best bet is to come here when you want good food, are with a group and know everyone is going to drink. The outdoor area is as expected fun so definitely an option for outdoor seating. Food has remained consistent and really good. I know a bunch of people who've complained about things here but they must just hit my sense of taste. I always like the burgers, find the fries really good and the steaks with spinach are the best. This place remains an indulgence for every couple months and I'm glad they came to Hamburg. It seems like they'll stick around for a bit. With a heavy heart I am only going to give The Bird three stars at this point. I've often been to their location in Berlin and really am a big fan. The combination of great steaks and burgers, with a bit of a rockabilly atmosphere mixed in with attitude and grunginess familiar to Berlin excel at that location. I awaited patiently the opening of the Hamburg location which I received the scoop on pretty early (someone knew someone and so forth!) Anyway, the 30th of April opening night was in my calendar real early. So we went and unfortunately had too high an expectation. Don't get me wrong. The food is just as it is in Berlin. You either like it or you don't. I like it and the burgers in my opinion are awesome and the steaks are always exemplary and consistent (although I only had a burger last night......steak next time!)So why only the three stars? Well it could be because it was opening night and we will be back, so take these three stars as only preliminary for me. Anyway, some things were just off. The restaurant itself isn't ""done"". There's no real deco on the walls and it's too ""clean"". Actually with the funny painting/light ceiling thing in the middle of the restaurant area it looks like a Turkish bath renovated into a cheap Italian restaurant. Did they not get some kind of interior designer involved in this process? The lighting is off too. Granted, some lights were obviously broken but the lighting is crap. Screw the modern stuff.....throw some candles on the tables and make it a bit more intimate/moody/whatever. With the fluorescent ceiling fixtures, it's just wrong. The tables are too new and modern. Why didn't they just go out and buy up a bunch of old, beaten up benches or tables from an insolvency sale. There is so much more character in something like that and more so than this Ikea style suburban dining set set-up they have. Somehow this all has to ""age"" and get a bit beaten up before I'll truly accept it. We'll see how time changes this place and I hope they ""finish"" decorating because right now it seems clearly unfinished.Staff were super nice. We had the Brazilian guy and two girls (everyone speaks better English than German.....as in the Berlin location) and the girls all have tats. Anyway, super nice but not yet up to speed. You have to get them informed of how things were in Berlin. Your regulars are going to come expecting what they know from Berlin. Brazilian guy was almost too nice if you know what I mean. But, to counteract that, the one tattooed girl was super nice but smelled of sweat. I guess that balances things out. :-) At least someone was a bit ""grungy.On a positive note, after we finished eating we were offered shots with our bill. The crowd was a bit edgy (wonder if it stays like this). The dog from Berlin was wandering around the place which adds charm. The outdoor benches will be awesome in the summer months, just like sitting out front in Berlin is. There is a ton of potential here. I may be over critical and it was their first night but I'm willing to wait it out. I'll definitely be back and also with a group of guys instead of the missus. This is more of a place to go with a group of friends, throw back some meat and empty a couple pitchers. Not a date-night place so do keep that in mind.Long story short, I hope this isn't the American owners getting older and settled and reflecting that in their new Hamburg place. Stay true to who you were, grunge up the place a bit and make it the relaxed, rocker-edge hang-out with great food and drink that it wants to be.",2012-04-21

https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bird-hamburg,1.0,"So after five months in Hamburg, I was finally overcome by my desire for a decent burger. Where would I go? I decided to go to The Bird after studying reviews on Tripadvisor and on other fora. In the end it all comes down to the meat, the bun, the cheese, the fries. They're a friendly, well intentioned bunch, but the vast lump of churned meat at the core of The Bird just does come up to standard when it comes to taste or texture. There is no 'bite', it's almost as if the meat has been reduced to the texture and feel of sausage meat. Perhaps they are catering to local tastes. Perhaps there are constrained by local produce. I don't know the reason. I would love to have been able to give them a good review. I would have loved to have had a reliable burger on my new doorstep. But I am afraid that the guys down at The Bird, friendly though they are, just do not know how to make a burger, their core product. Sorry.",2013-02-05

My partner and me tried two different menus and all dishes were tasty, except of curries  too salty.Not as pricy as I thought. Would definitely come back again.",2012-07-06
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sala-thai-hamburg-2,3.0,"The atmosphere here is certainly very pleasant. Staff is friendly, the restaurant is very nicely decorated, noise level is unobtrusive, etc.The food is, well, overpriced, just like others have already stated - think roughly 15 Euros for a vegetarian meal and about 18 for a meat dish.The focus here is on appearance and on sauce. Thus, you will receive a dish that looks visually stunning - but there won't be much to it. In essence, you will receive whatever your chosen main ingredient is, doused in a sauce.It's fine, but it's completely overpriced for what you get. You can apply this rule to just about any dish we ordered. Tofu and Chili? It's really just fried tofu and and a few slices of chili pepper in a spicy sauce. Would it have hurt them to add a few veggies? Of course, you might say that the food is exactly what the description says - and that is certainly true. However, I do NOT find this to be true at any of the rather many Thai restaurants I've eaten at around the globe. Maybe it's a German thing?The red curry followed the same principle - there was, however, a tiny bit of variation in it. We counted four peas. Three halves of mushrooms. Some carrot slices. And lots of cabbage. That seemed a bit lame. Alas, you know what took the cake: Mini Corn out of jar!!! I have no idea who in their right mind still uses mini corn in any dish, let alone a Thai dish - all I know is that's it's a big N O.Overall, our experience was nice - but this restaurant is not really up to snuff. I think Germany is still desperately trying to incorporate it's ""multi-kulti"" aspirations in the culinary scene - and things are improving. For now, the German palate still has not reached a comprehensive understanding of the wide array of food that is available. Sure, each cuisine is tailored to local tastes anywhere in the world - and that ""customization"" can be offensive if you expect ""authentic."" It's akin to eating Chinese food in Latin America. Or  ""Mexican"" in Germany (I've tried - I don't think that really exists).So, if you want Thai, then this is certainly acceptable. Don't expect to get any real Thai food - expect a bare minimum that caters to the German palate. It's close enough for now.I don't think I would go back. There are, quite apparently, better venues to be tried.",2018-02-25

The night we were there it was also packed with senior citizens. We were by far the youngest there (outside of staff) and we're in our mid-thirties. Nevertheless, the steak was OK. I wouldn't say it was anything more than average though. I found the meat a bit tough as well.

The sofa's seemed pretty new and in comparison to the disheveled ones in Zoe Bar there was the definite trendy atmosphere present. Service was good although I was a little dissapointed that there was either various Astra's or Carlsberg. The music bothered me a little here. They had a wide range but all played quietly. When they started playing Alternative or trance stuff then that sounded plain strange when it was so quiet. I was there on a Friday night and was surprised how quiet it was inside.

We came around 17:00 and it was empty--we almost hesitated going in but in the end, we were tired, hungry, and put all our trust in good reviews.My friend initially really wanted NOT a burger so if you're going for something besides a burger, they have like chicken fingers, a salad (yes, just one) and fish and chips. Also, if you're a vegetarian, there's a bunch of solid options on that end too. I couldn't decide from the loads of options, everything sounded amazing but in the end, I splurged for the Truffle Burger (7,90€)  and added an extra side of bacon (+1€). I also made it a meal by adding fries and a drink (3,90€ - choice of bottled beverages from waters to sodas to juices/lemonades to beer). My friend ended up getting the jalapeno burger (6,90€ i think?) with the meal as well.Our food came out pretty quickly and it was HUGE and honestly looked so delicious I barely got the plate and already started stuffing my face. I didn't even realize that they forgot the bacon at first until my friend realized they forgot to add it to hers too so we mentioned it and the chefs added it to the burgers. Holy moly, this burger is banging. The brioche bun has almost a pretzel-y flavor, almost smokey or whatever it is that makes pretzels get that rich brown colour. The burger was cooked a perfect medium (though I usually go for rare) and it was ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The fillings were fresh, though the truffle flavor wasn't super present--the bacon really added another dimension of smokiness and honestly it was so good I had a hard time putting it down. The fries were really good too! Crispy but tons of solid potato flavor. When we paid, they asked if we wanted ketchup or mayonnaise but I wasn't sure if it was extra and decided against it. The fries honestly didn't need any sauce but if you want something additional, they do have choluha (reg, green, chipotle) and oil/vinegar. The beer was also very refreshing, and produced in hamburg which was pretty nice!The place is a order @ the counter, buzzer, seat yourself kind of place and is super clean with really nice bathrooms. The staff was really friendly and honestly, this place really was a winner! I don't know what people are talking about in terms of sports bar (?) but it just felt like a nice casual burger place. Definitely recommend!! So good and so glad I stopped in :)",2017-11-01

I've only been in Hamburg for a month or so, but this is easily the best burger I've had in my time here. I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my wife got the Zillertaler Bacon Burger, and both were fantastic. Her's was a little heavy on the sauce, but that didn't really detract from the burger other than to make it messier. Prices were also totally reasonable.They've got great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. They even project whatever is on TV outside as well, so we were able to keep half an eye on the F1 qualifier.",2016-09-01

The level of service was in top (and in English!) however, they forgot the jalapenos in my burger even tho i asked for it. The food came very soon after I'd ordered.The bun was soft and very sweet - just as it should be. The burger had soft onions, double patties with double cheese and bbq sauce. Great combo. Very tasty burger and it tasted  homemade for each bite. The fries had peel on them which is delicious but I doubt they were homemade. The dippings were def. non-homemade. If the fries had been homemade roughly cut steak fries with homemade mayo we could have achieved the last star.Overall still a great experience and I'll surely come back if I have the chance.",2015-07-28

https://www.yelp.com/biz/hee-yang-hamburg,3.0,"Its is a small Thai/asia restaurant in my hometown back in hamburg, Germany.I was here before long before i used type/yelp. It is constantly ok'ish.It is not outstanding food but it is also not bad.This time i had fried wantan and i was really disappointed, a specialty in Germany is that the fried wantan are filled (that different to the us when i ask even my favourite Chinese spot, they never are able to make filled wantan, it don't really get why, cause in the WanTan soup they always use filled ones) - but back to my experience with Hee Yang, i was disappointed cause the wantan have been filled but with just a very, very small amount of meat. As main course i had chicken sweet and sour. It was a small portion (I was here for Dinner). The sauce was ok not outstanding and chicken just some pieces. On the positive side it was made with fresh ingredients like gherkins, carrots and pineapple. But as said not a lot, even the rice was a small portion. i was still hungry so that i had to order another starter so i had the satay chicken kebabs. The peanut sauce and the skewers have been very good. and i was happy that i ended with the kebabs. Overall ok, but for the small portion and mediocre wantan i have to reduce 2 stars. Just another point on the positiv side: everything (except the fisch sauce) is without MSGs. Immer wenn ich nach Hamburg zu Besuch komme in meine Heimatstadt ist ein Besuch in der Langen Reihe Pflicht. Ich war schon ein paar mal mittags bei HeeYang, diesmal war es 22:30 und ich war noch hungrig. So endete ich bei Yang. Ich bestellte mir WanTan, das besondere in Deutschland gegenüber der USA wo ich jetzt lebe ist das man hier die WanTan füllt mit Schweinehack, oder manchmal auch mit Scampis. Das wurde auch hier gemacht, aber so dünn und wenig das ich es erst gar nicht gesehen habe, geschweige denn geschmeckt :(.Nun weiter zum Hauptgang was ein knusprigen Huhn süß sauer war. Auch hier wiederholte sich eine übersichtliche Portion. Ich möchte beinahe sagen ich hatte gefühlte 10kleine Stücke Hühnchen. Die Soße war ok, mir gefiel das man merken konnte es wurde mit frischen Zutaten wie Gurken, Karotten und Ananas gearbeitet. Aber selbst diese Zutaten waren spärlich auf dem Teller verteilt. Die Soße selber war wirklich ok für meinen Geschmack, da hatte ich wesentlich bessere (aber auch wesentlich schlechtere). Nun sei es drum, ich war noch hungrig und habe dann die Satay Spiesse bestellt. Die waren dann 100% lecker und ich war froh das dies mein Abschluss war denn bei der Soße hätte ich am liebsten den Teller abgeleckt. Das Hähnchenfleisch war super zart und saftig perfekt gegart und eben einfach lecker. Die Spiesse waren mit Hähnchen und abwechselnd immer ein Stück Frühlingszwiebel gesteckt. Wenn ich wieder hingehe werde ich sicherlich drei oder viermal die Spiesse bestellten und woanders meinen Hauptgang holen. Die waren es wirklich wert. Dennoch am Ende des Tages muss ich sagen zwei Sterne gehen an den Geiz auf dem Teller verloren.",2017-05-15

The Sashimi was almost worth the wait, very tasty fish indeed. The surimi sticks could have been replaced by some other fresh fish (not so very original..).Only the wasabi was not as spicy and hot as I hoped for.The main course, curry beef, was exactly what I hoped for.

Nothing we ordered here tasted the way I thought it should have, but it was nice enough all the same.My husband ordered the cashew chicken which was generously portioned with nuts, veggies and meat in a flavorful sauce.I ordered a Tom Kha Gai which was a bit bland, but I soon fixed that up with some chilis in fish sauce (what they bring you in lieu of hot sauce). Was pleased. But then came my fried noodles which, in all fairness, more or less the exact same thing one gets at whatever Hamburg's equivalent of China Box is. Sure, it had bok choy and lots of meat in it, but it was absolutely flavorless and uninspired.We couldn't find anything resembling Phad Thai on the menu; maybe it was there and we missed it, but I was pretty disappointed about that. None of the awesome rice noodle dishes, no Pad See-Ew either.For the price, I thought we could have done much better at the dim sum up the street or even at the China Wok imbiss at the train station.The service was competent and the food was not bad, but we work hard for the little money we have and will spend it elsewhere in the future.

So I was worried, but it was surprisingly quiet that evening and we got a very nice room to ourselves with room for many more than our single tag-along guest. We were fortunate.But such popularity comes at a cost. I don't remember the prices being so high and the portion sizes so small for dishes which are relatively simple to prepare. €3.50 for a side of Bratkartoffeln. It couldn't have been more than 1 potato. (See photo)The service was excellent, as I expected it would be. Very observant waiters with a sense of humor. Although if you have a problem with your food (my friend didn't like the Pulled Pork Burger -- not enough BBQ flavor, which I agree with) they will look at you surprised and defend it and discuss it and deny it until finally they offer something to compensate. But that's typical of every Hamburg restaurant I've been to in the last 6 years. Even the foreign restaurants adopt this local attitude that nothing can ever be wrong with their food.But I have to reduce my review to 4 stars because, while the food is generally good and the service great (by German standards), they appear to be positioning themselves as something exclusive and gourmet by serving more porcelain than food and then charging an arm and a leg for it -- which would only be justifiable if the dishes were delicacies.",2015-04-04

It's most successful at being an upper class café (and rallying point for yummy mommies and the like) and acceptable for a drink, but I'd avoid the more complex restaurant offerings. There's a simple rule: Tiefenthal is good at simple things - salads, roastbeef and sandwiches. Unfortunately though the chef struggles with anything more fancy; the more expensive, the worse, at least as far as I can speak from my own experiences. The Wiener Schnitzel, for example, is a disgrace and not even cheap. There are about a dozen places I know in Hamburg where you can get a much better quality Schnitzel for the same money (Casse-Croute near Gänsemarkt, for example). Another problem is the service. On a busy, sunny afternoon it can take ages before you get your homemade ice tea (which is wonderful, by the way). Most waiters/waitresses are professional at their job, but on occasion I've had to deal with one particular waitress whose attitude is rather bold (bordering on impertinent).

https://www.yelp.com/biz/mikawa-hamburg-5,3.0,"Came here with work colleagues for something to eat.  As it was a nice day, we sat outside.  A casual arrangement on benches which means you may have to share a table with others but this is part of the atmosphere.  Of course the outside is probably more popular with the smokers so us non-smokers have to suffer the odd whiff of smoke in our direction.  A popular social area, there are street performers so if you are lucky you may get some live music as you dine.  Down side is that you can also get approached by beggars.Extensive menu of Japanese food from sushi, curries, noodles, rice dishes etc,  I think you would be hard pushed not to find something to eat.I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki which was nice if not a little too salty with a little too much sauce.  Nevertheless I ate it all.  My sushi loving companion loved their sushi dish.No pressure to move on once you have finished and so you can chill out with a beer after you have eaten also.Staff friendly (menus in German but then I didn't ask for an English one) and good value for money €65 for 4 of us with drinks and tip in that price.",2013-05-09

https://www.yelp.com/biz/mikawa-hamburg-5,5.0,"We went last night to Bok as I was in the mood for some asian food. I hadn't been here in years and took a look at the ratings. Was a bit worried as the Bok restaurants have been getting ""destroyed"" in the ratings because of service. WELL, they're listening. I was shocked at how nice our waiter was. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy. He asked every time he walked by whether everything was OK and whether we needed anything else. Almost American style (which pisses me off in the US but is nice to see in Germany). The food is great as everyone else writes. The menu is extensive and you'll find everything to fullfill you Asian eating wishes. The places tend to be full on Friday and Saturdays so consider reserving a table. I also can't wait until HH restaurants become all non-smoking. The place was not well ventilated and the people smoking around us kinda killed the experience and flavors of the food. This is soon remedied. In short, the service (at least at this outpost of Bok) took the bad criticism and made an effort to make us happy. Hopefully we didn't just get a good waiter and the rest suck. It will really be disappointing if I go back and service pisses me off. Then I'll never return as everyone else will simply have been right. UPDATE: We were there last night and service was horrible. We received half of our order wrong and the waitress serving us was less than interested in being good at her job. Further, both tables next to us also had mixed up orders. Finally, to top it all off, the folks behind us ordered something which was grilled at their table. Without my knowing it, my back was covered with oil which was splattering all over the place. My shirt was pretty much ruined and luckily I had my leather coat on a chair on the other side of the table. The management didn't care much about offering a solution for this problem except in hindsight saying I should switch seats....note this is after the back of my shirt was splattered with cooking oil. Finally, the food was less than stellar. The sushi was cut super thing (which was not the case the last time we were there). Additonally, I ordered a grilled beef dish which really didn't taste like much. Oh well, I wanted to like Bok but I won't be returning.",2007-07-07

There were several vegetarian/vegan options, but I've never seen halloumi cheese offered as a burger, so I had to try it. It was great!The farmhouse burger was a great surprise. It was a tower of meat that could easily feed a family of 6. Not what we were expecting. I think something got lost in the German translation. It was impressive even though my husband can only eat a small portion of it. Each burger was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and the quality of meat was very good.

The menu is in German, but they do a great job of explaining what is on it. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for our food to come, out come the masterpieces. We bit into them and we're immediately taken by how juicy and tasty they were. The burgers and fries were absolutely perfect !!! The toppings were fantastic, and fresh.

However, I will be updating because we have found our new burger place in Hamburg. We will be returning customers. Pros : 1. The burgers are fantastic. The meat is tasty and juicy but not oily and greasy. They were cooked to perfection. 2. The fries were also cooked to perfection. Not too greasy. They were prepared just right. 3. They make these awesome cookies and cream milkshakes. They are not too heavy and taste great. And this is coming from someone who doesn't usually drink milkshakes. But these were very very very good. 4. As good as the burgers and everything else was, the service was equally as good if not better. They really take care of their customers. Being from NYC, that is something that doesn't always happen. To see such attention to that service was a pleasant surprise. Cons : (Still trying to think of one).

The AYCE option came with its own menu so we wrote down the # of all the sushi pieces we wanted to try. The fish selection was limited and really only the salmon tasted fresh. We tried various nigiri (only 1 pc), hand rolls, big rolls (theres only 2 roll options (one veg and one not)) and maki rolls.The tuna did not seem fresh at all and seemed like it was sitting out for awhile as it had a dark discoloration to it that I was not used to seeing and it didn't taste fresh too. The place is pretty small and fits a handful of people. The place was about half full and I think the table behind us also did the AYCE option but ordered everything off the menu so the service for our food took a lot longer then we expected. After we finally got our first round we did place and order for a couple more rolls and it seemed like it took longer then expected again as there were only 2 people making the rolls behind the counter and I believe they were making for the rolls for the larger table behind us as well as a bunch of take out orders that came in all of a sudden.All in all, the price is a good deal for AYCE sushi but the service was extremely slow and the menu options were too limited for me to be coming back here anytime soon.",2015-09-03

Tasteful furniture and a minimalist wrought iron and glass bar. Cool. And they play jazz in here. Well, actually, of course they place jazz in here. It's cool. Like 60s cool. Old school cool. This is one of the best bars in Hamburg, so make sure you drop by. And don't drink anything other than absinth. One of the dev team disgraced themselves having a soft drink. Shocker.",2010-06-24

If you're familiar with it's old location this is literally more of the same. ""More"" in that it's much bigger, but it still retains the charm it used to have. With the increased space it seems that they're already attracting more customers, so the place is full most nights. One minor problem in these cold winter nights is that they seriously need to fix the door to make it close itself automatically. Trust me, after 10 minutes of sitting in there on a cold night you'll understand! My review of the old Absinth bar: We were on the way home from Omas. We were going to show our friend around the best bars in the schanze, but then we noticed the Absinth bar. We actually walked past, but then while discussing it briefly, we thought ""hey, why not"" and went back. The place is tiny, but really well decorated with a beautiful bar full of every kind of Absinth there is. The walls have plaster strategically removed in patches to give it a pseudo-shambolic feel. Not knowing one Absinth from the next we asked for some ordering advice. We were asked do you like it bitter? Do you like it sweet? Bottles were brought to the table and opened for us to sniff. I do wonder whether the service is always so great, because we were the only four people in there! Anyway, for us the service was great. Our chosen drinks were brought on silver plates, with silver spoons holding an absinth dowsed sugar cube. The owner then set alight each cube for us, and explained how to drink our drinks - for our second round there were different instructions for different absinths.

The selection of spirits is extremely comprehensive. I would guess they basically have everything, and serve it in style. You could also take a beer here, but why would you?

There's something mysterious and magical about the Absinth Bar, which reminds me of my teenage years, when we'd all dress up in black and run around the streets at night, hopping from bar to bar and listening to Within Temptation (I'm losing points for this, aren't I). The couple that runs this place are part of what makes this place a must-visit. The guy who served our table was extremely knowledgeable about Absinthe and it's sorts. It was obvious that this place was built around their passion for the drink and it's culture. The establishment itself is small, dimly lit and, well, green. It reminded me a bit of a bar you'd find in Narnia, after passing through the closet. I didn't have any Absinthe, but my friends did - the prices didn't seem like they'd break the bank, but they weren't entirely cheap, either. To be honest, if I would have ordered some Absinthe, I'd probably prefer to pay an extra few euros and get a quality drink. I'm following the age-old beer rule here: the cheaper the beer, the bigger the hangover. Perhaps I'll order a drink during my next visit, since it seems the folks who run the place will probably be able to suggest an Absinthe which my body won't, err, reject. I will, however, take a star off the rating for the seating arrangements in the bar.

Then we ordered a water for our son. However, just as our drinks were being prepared we were told by a member of staff that we had to move the the pushchair (although our son was still in it, not wanting to be held!) onto a grass verge across from the footpath and the cycle path! The reason being...it was an obstruction. There was enough space on the footpath for a pedestrian or push chair to pass and also the cycle lane was not obstructed. As another customer that left shortly afterwards said: ""I don't see what the problem is! There's plenty of room!"" Furthermore, the design agency next door were sat outside on benches and tables having lunch - this was in a narrow part of the street and would cause more of an obstruction to pedestrians. A little common sense could go a long way - if we were politely seated elsewhere (we had taken up position well in advance to buying out drinks funnily enough!), dealt with in a courteous manner, or even apologized to over the rude brashness of the staff member I wouldn't take issue. If you would like your coffee served with a slice of over zealous officiousness then this is a perfect cafe! Fine, you don't want to lose your right to outdoor seating, it's easy to quote: ""we need to keep a distance of 1,5m from a cycle lane"", rather than deal with improving the customer experience.

Secondly the drinks were a bit on the pricey side working out at 27 euros for three. So works out about £7 a drink, which is pricey compared to other places in the city.

It's a small and cozy place, and rather quiet, which had a drawback: I had the unfortunate experience of encountering elderly clientele there who were reading newspapers and thus thought it was perfectly appropriate to ask fellow coffee drinkers to remain silent due to this. I can only hope they had gotten lost on their way to the library. Nevertheless, I can't blame the shop! A+ coffee here, even if just for a delicious to-go cup.",2013-02-20

They offer a nice choice of small snacks, candy, soda, pastries and ... of course... coffee which comes in two sizes. Ever since I left Hamburg, I returned every once in a while only to find out that nothing has changed in Peaberries which definately is a good thing here.They have rather restrictive opening hours and only very little place for seating.

This restaurant is fairly close to Wunderland so if you're heading over there, definitely recommend stopping by! Typically you have to make a reservation but we were lucky and arrived at around 5:30 pm and scored a nice little table for 2 by the window.

I desperately tried to understand the regular menu but it was tough for someone who literally only knows ""danke"" and can barely pronounce it correctly!I was really craving Schnitzel and Spaetzle but unfortunately they did not have any spaetzle so I went for Schnitzel or the breaded pork with a fried egg and fried potatoes. My friend got the Salmon with Taligatelle. I also ordered a lübzer pils (0.5L obviously) and my friend took a bottle of still water.the food was super quick to arrive and it was delicious! my pork was moist, juicy with the most perfectly cooked and fresh egg (very yummy compared to the ones you get in the US!) and the potatoes were unbelievably tasty! My friend's pasta was also very well seasoned and her salmon was buttery and fresh. The meal really blew us away and hit the spot. Service was a little slow since it packed up quickly and we were all the way in the corner but that's fine--I enjoy the leisure of getting to relax and enjoy dinner at our own pace!

If you're new, try the small pasta plate (which is quite big), and you can basically choose from 3-5 pasta options and about a dozen vegetable and side dish options in any combination. You can also order meat options (costs extra) like a piece of chicken or some meatballs. 2. The server will make up your plate as you choose things, and when you're done, she'll hand it to someone to be heated up.

Firstly, they gave some fresh warm bread with a tomato sauce, which was delicious. But then, the starter-Bouillabaisse was bland. No proper seasoning, taste, it was too watery. For entry, I ordered turbot wrapped in bacon and risotto. Risotto was well done, but the fish was raw, it was probably frozen. The vegetables next to it was just way too bitter and overcooked. I do not know why the vegetables turned out greyish brown, but there was way too much lemon and/or ginger that made it too bitter I think. I did not order any dessert, however I did tasted my mom's dish, which was creme brulee and white chocolate mousse. There was nothing special with the mousse. I wish they put some liquor to make it more interesting. The creme brulee was way too hard. The top must crack as soon as you hit it lightly with your spoon but we had to use some force. The taste of the dessert was alright, but in my opinion not being able to cook soup, fish, vegetables, creme brulee is simply dissapointing for this restaurant.In conclusion, I would only go to this place in summer, to drink wine or beer, to enjoy the view.

And it was totally worth it. Absolutely incredible, it exceeded my expectations.Picture a table-top miniature train set. Now expand it to the size of a warehouse. On two floors. And add hundreds of trains, thousands of vehicles, millions of little people. Everywhere you look, there's some interesting little detail. I spotted a dozen monks working on repairing the Popemobile. A guy operating a jackhammer that would bounce around. Two people hiding on a roof that were fighting.The cars stop at lights. They even have their turn signals blinking before the light turns green and they head off on whatever mission they're programmed for.The airport? Absolutely beyond anything you can imagine. The planes take off and land. They taxi up to gates. The mini jetbridge pops out! The ground crew vehicles all follow the proper procedures for driving around the airport. They even have a fire brigade that leaves the firehouse to follow inbound trains.Tips: Get there as early as you can because it does get crowded. Make sure your phone is charged as you're going to want to take a million pictures and a ton of video. They do have a free wifi.This was one of the highlights of my week-long trip to Europe.[Review 12057 overall, 1840 of 2019.]",2019-10-17

You can also only send an hour or two if that's your preference. I was with a group no one in the group had been there before. It also shares a building with a Dungeon museum as well. It's a few flights of stairs up to the ticket area and there is an elevator as well. The lines are split up into no reservations, reservations, and private tours I believe was the last one. The day we went was very very busy. When we went to buy tickets we had the option of waiting a few hours until the crowd thinned out or come back later that night. There was a store and cafeteria that also served as the waiting area I believe but we chose to come back later. I thought it paid off as it wasn't as busy later in the night. It was open until 1 am which was great but surprising. The souvenier store serves as the entrance and exit. There are tons of good toys and trinkets which I bought a few on the way out. We didn't get a chance to eat at the cafeteria but it looked like typical cafeteria food with drinks and snacks as well. The seating area, which there were tons of seats, was all old airplane seats. Mostly two seaters facing each other with tables. Cool set up. The actual museum starts with the history of the museum and how it started. They have headsets, which are in English as well, that explain the first few exhibits. The workshop areas were also here. Because of how late it was, they were all pretty empty. Once you get past that, the ""real"" part of the museum starts. Miniature set ups of all types. Sweden, USA, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and a few more I believe. There is also a working airport as well and other little random displays. If I had to use one word, mind blowing would be it. The amount of detail and the displays are amazing. There was a set up of a live out door festival which was pretty spot on, like almost everything there. The displays also change times of the day, I want to say every 15 minutes or so, so the same displays now come to life via the night. Lights turn on, headlights, street lights, etc, Many parts are also moving with a push of the button so there is tons to see whether its night or day. This is where you can send hours on each display just studying all of the little things going on. Most of the displays also have a ledge to stand on so you can lean over and see closer. This is also where big crowds here can get difficult. The working airport is one of my favorite parts. Planes of all types take off and land and gate and refuel, load, etc. It's pretty amazing. If you're a Star Wars fan, there are definitely a few references which you'll have to pay attention to spot. Definitely one of the coolest places I've been to in a very long time.

We enjoyed the Italy displays the most. We felt the US displays were put together a bit too randomly.   For example, you have a backdrop of a tornado, against a space shuttle launch, situated next to Las Vegas and Miami beach. The US displays were also a bit sterotypical, which included a ""gold rush"" scene that didn't seem synced up. Lots of fun though.

There are waterways with miniature ships going around. And so much built around the trains that they actually become more of a background and the main selling point. This place is stunning in its love to detail and the plethora of jokes and social commentary you can find throughout the miniature structures.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/miniatur-wunderland-hamburg,5.0,"Honestly one of the best tourist attractions in the world. You absolutely must see this place at some point in your life. Miniatur Wunderland is a massive museum of models. It started out as just model railways, and indeed railways do continue to make up a significant portion of the place, but it's expanded to so much more. There are glorious mountainous scenes, recreations of the world's great cities, and piles and piles of cars and humans as well. My personal favourite is the model airport, with a huge selection of planes, terminals, fuel trucks, passengers. Literally everything has been thought of. The planes even land and take off in front of your eyes! Tremendous!The detail throughout the place is astounding. I literally spent 10 minutes just staring at the football stadium, where a match between Hamburg and St. Pauli was happening. The spectator's excitement, the floodlights. Top class. Another little detail that caught my eye was when I peered into a random office building, and saw two colleagues secretly kissing in the office. A tiny detail that most people probably don't see, but it is so realistic and well thought-out. I'm sure these details are evident throughout the Wunderland. Would love to hear about some others from people. :)It's well worth the entrance cost. You can really see where your money is going when you pass by the workshop and see the newer areas being constructed. I can't even imagine the sheer number of hours that went into creating this, and there's more being built all the time. By paying your entry fee, you are helping create something amazing!There is a shop and restaurant on site, both of which are reasonably priced, and have a selection of stuff. The shop has a huge variety of models and toys and collectibles. The restaurant interior is designed to look like sitting on a train or in an aeroplane. Very cool.In conclusion, if you're anywhere close to Hamburg, please PLEASE visit Miniatur Wunderland. I don't regret it one bit, and hope to be back to see your new creations in the future. :D",2016-01-22

As you walk through they have a display of Switzerland, Hamburg, The airport, USA, Scandanvia and Bavaria (there might be one or two that i am missing maybe?) Italy was under construction. My absolute favorite was Switzerland, it was huge and it extended a bit on the third floor. Make sure you spend enough time in each country for the day-night transition because that blew my mind. The way the lights flickered and the train lights came one at a time was very life-like. They even had little miniature people inside the trains and cars as they went by. You will experience everything in this place, from a miniature concert experience to even little disasters (I don't want to spoil anything). This place is a must-see attraction. If you are in hamburg you have to go! Best 12euros I have ever spend!",2014-05-12

(I'm a little surprised/ashamed I didn't write a review yet...)This place is incredible. It's several stories of a warehouse that's been converted into an aptly-named miniature wonderland. The attention to detail into every aspect of this space is simply astounding. It perfectly encapsulates what happens when smart, whimsical people set their minds to building amazing, tiny things :)Kids probably love it, too, but knowing my nephew we would probably never make it past the first floor-- it's that big and engrossing. I found the control center the most fascinating part, but others in my group liked the airport-- planes ""took off"", ""landed"", taxied and did it all over again on a schedule that was tracked in real time on a screen. Several places seem pretty darned accurately modeled in terms of what a place actually looks like; others have taken a wee bit of poetic license to make it fit within the warehouse (for example, the USA section represents Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and several other places that look as if they're right next to each other, when that is not exactly how it goes in the US). There's even a model of Hamburg. I won't spoil the wonder of visiting for yourself with any more details about what you'll see-- just plan to spend at least a few hours here to fully appreciate the splendor.",2015-09-14

The rest was just a bonus. And while I sort of had to rush through it, in the sake of a schedule, it was great to see and I will be back when I have more time. So, the airport part. You may have seen it on TV. It's pretty neat, seeing the planes take off, land, taxi around. Seeing the vehicles driving around. Seeing the airport go from day to night and back again (like the other exhibits). As an aviation nerd, I greatly appreciate the real airlines and real aircraft types being used. Now, on to the rest - really pretty neat to see Switzerland, Scandinavia, Germany, Hamburg, the USA and others all exemplified in miniature. Trains are what they are focused on, but that's hardly the only thing there. Just keep your eye out for fun little things - emergency vehicles rushing to a scene, dead bodies being fished out of the water with a coffin nearby (seriously), concerts, auto accidents, and various other random stuff.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/miniatur-wunderland-hamburg,5.0,"Miniature Wunderland is the world's largest model railway layout, and makes for a super half day out for children (of all ages).Actually, it might be more accurate to say layouts: the exhibition area is an amazing 5,000m2, and there are rooms depicting Austria, Switzerland, different parts of Germany, Scandinavia and even parts of the USA (not the UK, though, alas!). And it isn't just abut trains: one of the most popular exhibits is a huge scale model of Hamburg airport, complete with planes taxiing and taking off, with all the service vehicles scurrying about, and even cars queuing for the car parks!It's hard to describe everything as there is so much to see  and it is as much about the details as it is the scale. As well as trains, planes and cars, there are trams, ski lifts, cable-cars, and even model ships moving through the fjord in the Norwegian section  where the water tank even has a tide. Some areas are on two levels, and the depiction of iron-ore mining town of Kiruna in Sweden shows the underground mine workings: kids seemed to love pressing the button that sets off an explosion. (There are buttons to press at various points to make things happen). There are football stadia and pop concerts taking place, as well as fairs and religious processions, all peopeld with thousands of 1cm high people. Oh, and the whole place regularly switches from day to night, when the twinkling of millions (literally) of LED lights gives a completely different perspective.My favourite cameo was a man chopping down a tree which then crashes through the roof of the adjacent house. The lady of the house then comes out and remonstrates with him! The control centre is also fascinating to watch (lots of screens controlling everything) in a James Bond-ish kind of way.Facilities include a cafe and large shop (of course).

This place is incredible; all of the hype is absolutely justified.I don't want to spoil the experience for you (exactly the same words my coworker told me when she recommended Miniatur Wunderland, which I now completely understand), so I'll just give you a few tips for ensuring a great experience:1. You can and should make a reservation online before you visit. It's a little weird because you don't actually need to pay for this reservation; it's just some kind of ticketing system to control flow.2. If you're visiting on a weekend or a holiday, plan to go as early as possible, like between 8:30-9:30am. The place starts filling up with visitors around 10am and the experience is way better when it's empty and you have the place to yourself.3. The entrance is on the 2nd floor and there are lockers available for stowing your backpacks (1euro deposit). Take the elevator to the 3rd or 4th floors where the exhibits are. I was really concerned about ""where to start"" but in the end it really doesn't matter. You'll be impressed no matter what order you see everything in.4. There are buttons on the railing throughout the exhibits, which activate various details in the scene. Press ALL the buttons!

My favorite miniature area was Hamburg, because I live here and it was cool to recognize the layout of the city, see the Hafencity, the churches, the super cool HSV football stadium complete with HSV fans in the seats,  etc..... Miniature displays are also more identifiable with people if they personally know the thing or place well that is being miniaturized because we all like to check for accuracy and are amazed at the details and intricate work that goes into these ornate displays.Tip: Try to either go really early in the day when it opens or really later in the day before it is about to close, otherwise, it is often too crowded to see anything and you feel rushed to look at move on so you are not blocking the way for others to see.",2012-05-26

Owner:At the end of the 90s the Braun brothers Gerret and Freddy of Hamburg had the idea to build the world's largest model railway and to show it to the public against entrance fees. As they both seem to be ""crazy guys"", they have not only tried to be the largest, but also to amend unique highlights. Unfortunately I don't know any of them, I have seen them only on TV.Until today, their company has grown to as much as 100 employees.Site:The ""Miwula"" is located in the ""Speicherstadt"" (= storage quarter where old storage houses are located) on the 4th level of Block D on the street Kehrwieder #2. It can best be reached by public transport. The subway station ""Baumwall"" on the yellow line ""U3"" is only 10 minutes walk away from the ""Miwula"". For car fans, there are some pay parking lots available, which are quickly overcrowded on the weekend or during the holiday season. Waiting hours:Since the ""Miwula"" has opened in 2001, it has become one of the main attractions in downtown Hamburg. As it is only possible to see something if there are not more than about 100 people inside, the Miwula Management has decided not to let more than these 100 people inside. If there are more visitors, they will have to wait until other people have left again. On weekends and during the holiday season, it may happen that you wait more than an hour.VERY GOOD: as a spezial serviced the ""Miwula"" offers on ist website statistics about the waiting hours of the past and predict the visitors of the next days including waiting hours. Usually, there are more visitors around lunch time. NICE: on the homepage you can also find suggestions where to go elsewhere in Hamburg. What a pity that they have only two suggestions.Opening hours:Daily from 9.30 AM until 6.00 PM, on Tuesday until 9 PMOn the weekend from 8.30 AM until 8 PM. Especially in the evening hours the ""Miwula"" is highly flexible, also during special event like the Harbor Anniversary or the Football World Championship. Entrace fees:Adults EUR 9 (~£ 6 or $ 11.50), Children under 16y EUR 4 (~£ 2.70 or $ 5), Children smaller than 1 meter are free. They have a variety of rebates for seniors and groups and even yearly subscription cards. For a family with two kids the total entrance fee would be EUR26. I personally believe that it's worth its money. About the Traings and landscape:The ""Miwula"" only shows trains in scale 1:87 (which in Germany is called H0 = half nill), most trains go on the Märklin digital system with 16V AC power. In the US contruction part, however, the trains go on DC power system. Most visitors won't realize this fact, however this construction makes it impossible for the trains to switch between these two systems. On the other hand this is quite realistic, as you will hardly find US trains in Europe and vice versa.Every 15 minutes the lights will turn from white to red, then blue until they are switched off for a few minutes to simulate the night. Interestingly, the constructors have also achieved that the train and car traffic is reduced in volume during this time. It is a very realistic simulation of the night & day changes.Phase 1 of the construction reflects Southern and Central Germany and was constructed within eight months. On the 300 square meters there are 3 kilometers of tracks with 450 switches. 230 trains with 2,400 coaches roll over the layout. Already in Phase 1 the constructor were very successful to implement small scenes with much love for details. In one area you see prisoners escaping from jail, in another a loving couple in the forest, and yet in another some strike activities in a coal mine. As a further technical highlight, there are many model cars in the same scale driving through the many streets. It is always big fun when the fire engines get out to address a burning house or castle. Quickly after finishing the first Phase, the ""Miwula"" got quickly known and attracted many visitors. In November 2002, Phase 2 was opened showing Hamburg and the North German Coast line. You see the separate subway systems, street demonstrations, a Techno Move and many other fabulous details. One of the most important models is the making of the Hamburg Football stadium. Even the large screens in scale 1:87 work and can be illuminated in whatever direction. Ín December 2003 Phase 3 was finished: America. Here you can find Las Vegas with all its lights, models of the famous Big Boy - the largest ever built steam engine, you see temperature announcements on the highway in °F (instead of °C), and on Area 51 some",2007-11-15

https://www.yelp.com/biz/stockholm-espresso-club-hamburg,4.0,"We went there for the coffee and were pleasantly surprised by the food.  The toasted bagel the hubs ordered with lox & all the trimmings was so very tasty.  A little dab of sweet mustard was the secret ingredient.  -feeling a bit under the weather I ordered a small (4dl?) carrot juice with ginger.  It was just how I would have made it for myself.  The ginger boost was such that I felt I'd never catch a cold again!  Both the bagel and juice were served by a smiling young woman who works in the kitchen.The light roasted beans a la a roastery in Sweden (naturally!) make for a slightly-sour-never-bitter cup and I, for one, am quite glad about that.  The flat white is made with a lactose-rich milk that produces a lovely sweet flavour when heated correctly.  The espresso macchiato (aka noisette in Parisian third wave joints) is made with a 'usual milk' and the drink is tinged with a sour note.We then ordered an Aeropress and were presented with *thee* most choice one could ever hope for!  I think the selection was upwards of twelve different roasts!  Qual der Wahl, baby.  Some of the roasts were meant to ape various black tea varieties.  Eric chose an African bean, Kamigeri, and was quite pleased with both the aroma and flavour.  -a hint of black tea, orange and currant.The young man behind the counter was very enthusiastic, friendly and didn't assume that one didn't know a fig about coffee.  -could be due in part to his having only been on the job for approximately two weeks on our visit.  This made for a friendly exchange when ordering.Winterhude, the area in which SEC is located, is also in and of itself worth a visit.  For those out-of-towners keen to visit H.H., I would strongly encourage not only a trip out of the usual destinations like Reeperbahn & the Harbor, but a trip specifically up to Winterhude with a stop or more in Eimsbüttel as well.",2015-02-12

https://www.yelp.com/biz/stockholm-espresso-club-hamburg,3.0,"This coffee shop has been hyped as one of the best places in Hamburg for a coffee. For me personally, to test the coffee quality in an outlet specializing in coffee the gold standard is to order an Espresso. What shall I say? Their Espresso is a far cry from a decent Espresso... it looks like a bland blackish puddle produced by a fully automated machine and tastes also like it. No crema, very watery. The only plus is a very fruity and light taste to the coffee, reminding me of a spring flower bouquet. So, coffee quality fairly ok, preparation a no-go. Service is definitely not this spot's strength with both counter attendants minding their own business with an air of utter indifference toward the customer. Maybe this experience is a one-off and I would see a very different atmosphere some other time around. Yet, there won't be another time.",2019-03-16

https://www.yelp.com/biz/bok-restaurant-hamburg-schulterblatt-hamburg,3.0,"First of all, be careful when telling friends ""Let's meet at Bok,"" in ""Schanzenviertel,"" because for one, there are several chains in Hamburg and next, there are I believe three already in the Schanze area.   I first ate at the Bok on Susannenstrasse with friends from University when I moved to Hamburg, which we found was a nice meal, comparably to the Mensa (cafeteria) food that we more or less often ate on a regular basis.  This sushi bar is really great for students because it is casual, yet feels a bit upscale, but  affordable.  It is levels above Sushi Circle which I personally think people eat there simply for the entertaining factor of prepared sushi on a rotating belt.  Otherwise, instant sushi is never quite as delicious as freshly made to order. If I visit Bok, I like the location along Schulterblatt because during warm days and summer weather, they bring out long wooden benches to eat outdoors.  This street is great for dining outside with friends, people watching, and having some drinks well into the evening, then heading over to the several bars in the immediate area. I would go here if you prefer a variety of sushi choices, vegetarian options, like Japanese noodles, sitting outdoors in the warmer months to come and want to be in the midst of the buzzing Schanzenviertel neighborhood vibe, off the main street, at an affordable price.",2012-05-16

I ordered the pork shank. The skin was charred to a semi-darken crisp that enveloped the layers of succulent meat and gelatinous fat inside. Its entirety was sitting upon savory but slightly sour gravy. Served alongside were pickled root vegetables and a warm potato dumpling. While the food was appetizing, it was difficult to cut the pork without having the flakey skins fly everywhere. Fortunately I was wearing my throw-away clothes, so I didn't mind spilling gravy and pulling oily flakes of pork skin off my shirt. Note that the portions are HUGE! I could only finish half my plate. If dining with friends, I would suggest splitting the dishes. Because I came in during the afternoon on a day that was between Christmas and New Years, it was relatively empty. I am sure this place gets packed and rowdy during football matches since they have large television screens broadcasting games.

Schnitzel and fries for 5eu :) --- Further to the above review, I've since been back twice. The first time was much the same, but the second time they were incredibly inattentive and slow. It took them literally 15 minutes to notice that our group of 15 had walked through the door. They then took forever to bring a few of the meals, and my schnitzel had a large fraction of inedible gristle in it. I'd still go again, but they're losing a star off the rating.",2007-11-06

Being from Bavaria myself and loving Bavarian food  this is one of the few places in Hamburg to get some. We went to get ""schweinshaxe"", a classic. (Grilled pork shank). First, instead of the typical bread dumplings, it comes with potato dumplings, ok, small issue. But the true dissappointment was the Haxe itself. It was dry and the crust (the best part) was hard as a stone. My feeling is they had put too many on the grill and just warmed up the leftover ones from yesterday, poured the fat over it and sold it as fresh. My mother in law had the pork roast, which had no crust whatsoever and was dry as well. These people are ruining the reputation of Bavarian food! its a Tourist trap. You want the real deal? Go to Munich, at least its the original trap. To be fair, I had a decent Haxe before, at the Speersort -branch of the Hofbräuhaus. But there the waitress was so unfriendly that I did not want to go again. Bad choice, obviously. I'd rather handle grumpy waitresses than bad food.

The food was satisfying and affordable (some of us had a large schnitzel with fries for 5eu). Very nice, traditional, home-style cooking and all-around a good comfortable place to have lunch in groups of all sizes. Highly recommended! EDIT:It looks like I'm going to have to bring the rating down for this place.

We were placed in the middle of the restaurant and it seemed uncomfortable at the beginning. My wife and me got seated at a 6 seater with just one couple with us. The tender told us, that he is the menu tonite, so we don't need to read. Decision was easy: he asked us if we want fish, meat or vegetarian. We decided to go with the fish menu. As start we got olives with tasty bread and kind of mayonnaise-garlic sauce. After a while the flambed scampi arrived and that was a big start!! The second course was a super tasty mix of tuna and pike-perch fish. This was the time we realized that everybody in the room took the fish menu - and they started to serve the courses simultaneously. After the second course they served a shot for everybody with general salut! After a while one of the tenders showed up with the next course - in raw format. It was a loach and a kind of a big fish! Meanwhile a guitar singer walked through the room and gave us a big Portuguese feeling with singing pretty good and impulsive!The third course arrived and that was a big one! The Loach of course and a super tasty sword-fish we're served with tasty vegetable. Each fish got his own sauce (as with every course) and it was great! The dessert was good and after that another shot arrived. Each course and shot was announced once to the entire audience.With all that, we experienced a great dinner with a feeling of being big friends to guest at friends!

https://www.yelp.com/biz/bullerei-hamburg,4.0,"After a team building event nearby our whole team from all of our company's different offices enjoyed dinner at Bullerei.  I was told by one of my colleagues that lives in Hamburg that this is owned by a famous local chef and is a hipster restaurant.  The atmosphere is farm hipster sheik.  Since we were a big group we had a set pre fixe menu.  They were very kind to ask us if there's anything we are allergic to or strongly dislike and I told them a few of mine.A delightful amuse bouche was brought out to us before the handful of appetizers.  Everything was served family style.  A hunk of glorious burrata was served and steak tartare for appetizers.  I love medium rare beef but just can't get myself to eat tartare; I heard it was excellent though.  The burrata was nice and creamy and served with plump tomatoes and arugula.  I've heard that seafood is huge in Hamburg, and for the second dinner in a row, I was presented with huge head on prawns.  For veggies they gave us a nicely dressed salad with the right amount of dressing.  They also served us corn on the cobs with a holder.  Corn was average.  We also ordered a few bottles of Sauvingon Blanc which was light and sweet enough for my picky palette.  Next up were the entrees which were hunks of beef and some salmon.  I am super picky with fish so I went for the beef.  It was a bit fatty but the pieces I got were perfectly mid rare.  It could have used more seasoning but they also gave us a few sauces to use.  Also accompanying our protein were delicious plates of asparagus and roasted potato slices.  Gotta have your veggies and carbs! I was already stuffed, but dessert was up next, and I'm always a sucker for dessert.  They gave us various bowls of fruit mousse, a cream mousse topped with fruit, chocolate mousse, and a huge bowl of scoops of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice creams.  We were a group of about 12 women and for us it was served family style, so not sure about what others mentioned about micro portions but we had a ton of leftovers to bring to the office the next day.  I feel like it's most of Europe though, with long leisurely dinners (we got here around 8ish and left around 11).  Service was attentive and the food was good, though my favorites were the steak, veggies, and dessert.  Everything was fairly average, and I don't think there's really an area of Europe that's really known for steak unlike areas of the US.  Everyone says it's a hipster place, yes, but the area is a hipster neighborhood too.  It's a bit of a trek from our office, but if you're in the area, I'd recommend it.  I'd say 3.5ish rounded up.",2016-02-01

Place was packed and the young waitress did her best to get us a table. All is well at this point. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. First off, the food is mediocre. We had tapas primarily and had ordered six different plates. Each and every one of these was bland if not downright bad. The turkey with ""devil sauce"" (whatever that is) was horrible. The chorizo with white beans was also disappointing. The meatballs in tomato sauce we also just bland. The other plates.....completely forgettable. Worse than the food was the house wine. I am convinced it was watered down. Either it was a horrible 2 Euro bottle from Aldi or some other discounter or they added water to ""stretch"" it. One way or another, bad. Anyway, too bad that the food just doesn't work here. It seems genuinely Portuguese and could be a great little place to come for good food. Unfortunately, they've long ago stopped focussing on quality food and just rip off tourists at this point. In this part of town you'll fill your restaurant without even trying.

It was a bit expensive at €21 for 6 oysters but I had to try it as I have not had any oysters since arriving in Germany :-) I think I will keep looking for good oysters but it is not easy to find.This place is certainly not cheap and lunch for two with two courses and mineral water was around €80.

We had fried chicken, 2 bowls of ramen (the 12/13€ ones, can't remember the names), and 1 dessert (mochi ice cream). The chicken was good, fresh, good coating, crispy and the chciken was really soft and juicy. It lacked some flavor in my opinion, but I was aware that Japanese tend to have quality food with less intense flavor, natural. There was a dipping sauce, was ok, but I wished there was some sea salt or other additional dipping. Would order it again!The ramen, the main attraction, was a little disappointing, I am afraid to say that. I was looking forward to the broth - it was indeed rich and thick - but it had really little flavor, personally I liked some ramen better back in Japan (like street food ramen for 5€). It lacked the soothing taste of rich porky flavor, Indon't know how to describe. The ingredients, noodles, pork meat were ok too. I wish I could have given a positive review for the ramen, but it was just ok.The mochi ice cream was good, nothing too exciting, but a refreshment after the rich and fatty food. SUMMING UP: I wish it was our favorite ramen shop nearby, but it is not. Whenever we feel like having soothing ramen (esp. on cold winter days), we wouldn't think of the ones here. Even though it is not bad, it wouldn't be satisfying either. The chicken was the best, followed by the dessert. While the ramen in total was almost good, the main criteria for me, the broth, didn't give me that sense of satisfaction I am looking in bowl of ramen.Maybe we will try it out again, in winter, but until then we will hunt for another ramen (if there is any).Not included in rating: The price for everything (fried chicken, 2x ramen, 1 dessert, 2 drinks) was 45€, not good value in my opinion, compared to the expectations I had.

I can't imagine what the wait must be on weekends. Worth knowing: if you arrive and there's a queue, you still need to go in and put your name down on the waiting list. Even when I left round 20:30, there was still a queue!I got edamame beans to start off with. They were well salted and tasty. The portion is huge for a starter. I would say these are enough beans for 3 . Next I got the Nitamago Wakame Miso Ramen. They have 3 bases on offer for their ramen: miso, shoyu and shio. They also all come with certain toppings; viewable on the menu and the difference between them tends to lie in the additional toppings. I was glad that they include a naruto on it; gives good colour and naruto is quite tasty.The best part of a ramen to me is the soup base and this base was amazing. Not as spicy(chilli) as I would have liked but this is something I've slowly finally come to grips with in Germany; I find the average spicy level here less than mild. Thankfully they provide additional chili to add, its called house spice  and is essentially a chilli oil. With the right amount of this added, the base was just right.

On most typical nights, you are crammed onto tables with strangers eating cheek to cheek, elbow to elbow. I mean, at times, we even have to battle it out to hang our purses, coats, scarfs, etc on the hooks that are just not enough to go around.  And do not even try to set your jacket or bag on a chair to store it, thinking that it will deter people away from sitting next to you.  NOPE, major failed plan.  This is Germany, they simply say, ""Ist hier Frei?"" essentially translated into, ""No human being is occupying this chair right? Ok, then please remove your personal belongings so I can plant my hungry butt down.""  Yep, Vapiano's is a hustle.  Hustle to get a tray, get in line, get your order in, get a drink, or stand in a separate area for alcohol, and then good luck getting back in line for dessert later.  Even with all this fuss, we all still go there... The food is not of the highest quality, but it is tasty and moderately priced maybe even considered cheap to the non student crowd, and the atmosphere is somehow posh-casual.  It is kinda like the Starbuck's of Italian Pizzeria food chains, not just in Hamburg, but even when I was in New York City, it is always a similar story and routine.  Local Tip: Go here on Thursday night. For some reason, that is ""the night"" at Vapiano's on Hallerstrasse.  For some reason, people like to be seen here on that night.  I guess it is because the week is almost over and people want to get ready for the weekend, so they come for cocktails, since it has decent food, and is near the train stop, it can bring people living in the areas of Harvesthude, Eppendorf, Rotterbaum, and even Mitte together simply because it is off the U1 Train.My favorite salad is the steak one with shrimp, a bit of surf & turf.  As far as pasta, I love the curly noodles one that has a bit of a spicy beef tip/tenderloin with mushrooms and rucola, and a creamy tomato sauce, yummy.  To drink, if I am not drinking my liquid antioxidant of choice, Red Wine (good for the blood!), then I take usually an Orangina, since it has a cute genie like bottle and a fresh citrus taste to it that goes lightly with any meal you choose, whether soup, salad, pizza or pasta.",2012-05-25

This was a hamburger that called for the use of forks and knives. Not knowing it was venison, the patty did strike me as odd. It appeared to me that the venison meat was not grounded well enough, and then was smashed together into a burger patty; it was kind of like a piece of steak that fell apart to easily when you bit into it. It's hard to describe. There wasn't enough salt on the patty either for my taste. The bio bread was difficult to cut or even bite into. My burger devolved into a messy heap. I did like the mayo and the grilled onions. Others have complained about the fries, but I rather liked them a tad soft. I washed it all down with a rhubarb fritz cola. It was 9€ for the burger plus 3.50€ for the added fries and drink. The restaurant itself is a cool spot. I dig the decor. The food came out fast and the staff was very friendly. The hubby and I decided, possibly in unison, that we would likely not order the burgers again. That is, unless they make it feel more like an actual burger patty.

They have both sushi and ""hot plates."" The portions are small, but there were tasty options. The edamame was served cold though. Like, just taken out of the refrigerator, cold, not even room temperature. Maybe that's normal in Germany or for this place, but I found it displeasing. The sushi rolls you order come with 2 pieces (so 2 pieces is 1 item out of your 10). The salmon nigiri was very good. There were large slices of salmon over the rice, and it tasted very fresh. The sushi rolls were good as well. But keep in mind for every piece you do not eat, they will charge you extra. By the end we were forcing ourselves to finish a few sushi rolls so we didn't have to pay extra for them.  Drinks are not included, so don't be surprised at the end if your bill is slightly higher than you would pay at any other sushi restaurant. For two people, we ended up paying about 65 Euros for our dinner. We definitely wouldn't spend that much if we went to any other sushi restaurant and ordered individual rolls, however, we also wouldn't have been able to try so many different things. So if you're on a budget, maybe skip this place. The sushi took a long time to arrive. If we ordered sushi in round 2, it would arrive at the same time if not after we had ordered hot dishes in round 3. It also took a long time to find our waiter so we could pay. When one of the servers came and picked up our empty plates, we told him we were ready to pay and he said he would tell his colleague.

We came at lunch on a weekend so it was 15.90 per person--honestly rather steep for the quality of food. I had a hankering for sushi so we ordered most of the sushi, especially those with the raw fish. The only decent thing was the sake (salmon). The octopus and squid were super chewy and had no flavor. The tuna maki was a little concerning because the rice around the fish had turned pink. That shouldn't happen unless the fish was dyed, or something. Also all the maki tasted like they was pre-made and left out for awhile. We tried the warm dishes and the tofu was the most tasty so we ordered a second one, but it was cut too thick so the center was not warm at all.

Twenty minutes later, we ordered the next round, this time warm dishes, all very good and very fresh as you would expect from a place with this rapid a turn around. Highlights were grilled fish.Next round, more or the same, some of the grilled items were delectable, yet came in small portions.Still going strong, we started on the sushi, here there was a slight difference in quality between the hand rolls and the smaller sushi, which I suspect were machine made, so we opted to continue with the fresher hand rolls.This continued until the fifth round when our appetites began to flag, but hey, you do the maths 5 rounds equals 50 items per table of two. No small achievement!Drinks were slightly expensive, but they had some excellent beer on tap.With an offer from Groupon, the total cost of this feast was just over Eu 30, not bad I would say.Service was friendly, efficient and informal.Bottom line, this is not really a sushi restaurant, more of a Pan-Asian, fun house!

Maybe in an affectionate way - or just made with real expertise. Prawns, fish, meat and veg all just close to being perfect: veg being al dente, the meat tender, the seabream crispy and the sauces very well/naturally flavoured.

It's only a short 5 minute walk which is pretty good considering the HafenCity is a bit of a pain when it comes to public transport. The building is nicely set in a Speicherstadt style house. Just walking into the building is impressive. Suddenly switching from old to ultra modern! I must admit I felt like I just walked into an ultra stylish restaurant or clothes shop. Fantastic effect!!After paying the 7.50 Euro for the ticket (it's worth even if you only 'like' the look of cars). The staff were incredibly attentive I must admit. From being generally cheerful to giving helpful advice. Not sure if that's just a case of them still being in the opening phase or something.To the cars..A fantastic collection of various unique cars. Every car has in front of it a info box embedded in the floor. And what impressed me more than anything was a ~7 inch TFT display with a info video on loop (nice touch!).The first segment has a varied collection. But when you move deeper in then you get a lot of Porsche's. Not that I am complaining!Right at the back of the first floor is the simulator, a converted Porche 356 with a nicely sized flatscreen (tasteful enough sized). So you can drive a simulated track using the real steering wheel and gear shift. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to get on it as there were a lot of kids hogging (next time I will give it a go!).So after going round the first floor I finally find a Audio Room. Basically a 2m x 1m room with a touch screen display. Guessed what you can do in this room? Listen to the different sounds of different cars racing off. Fantastic I had a wonderful 10+ minutes of eardrum damaging fun!What else was on the first floor. The typical movie theatre affair with a HUGE screen. Although the video quality was not all that fantastic (they must have upscaled it).Downstairs is a temporary exhibition which was relatively basic but still fantastic. Some Formula 1 racing cars and very impressive Audi's.The one bit I totally missed out on was the art gallery. Next time I will have to take a look.So all in all Prototyp Hamburg is WELL worth a visit.So now done with the positive stuff. There were a few nigels I had with the place. The first being the touch screen computers. They were often very fiddly to use. For example in the Audio Room you had to double click on the volume control and make sure you helld your finger down to adjust the volume. Me being a techy it's no surprise right? :)The only other nigel is that the transition being floors is a little unclear. When you leave the first floor you feel like you have just left the exhibition.

I quickly learned how to say the various parts of my order in German (mixed salad, egg, beans, corn, mushrooms, tomato, parmesan cheese, balsamic dressing), though most of the staff is pretty fluent in English. Visiting from SF where a custom lunch salad can easily cost $14, the prices here (around 5-8 euros for a custom salad, depending on what you put in it) seem very reasonable.There's some indoor seating but it's pretty packed at lunch, so you may want to plan to take your meal elsewhere.

I went there for dinner twice during a 4-day stay in Hamburg. Pizzas are one size only, which is huge, so unless you haven't eaten for 3 days, don't order a whole pizza for yourself, you will be very satisfied with just a half. Toppings are amazing, however, depending on which pizza you order, you may get a very small amount of the premium ingredients. This was true with the Caprese pizza which came only with 3 small slices of mozzarella and with the spicy salsiccia pizza, which came with just a handful of the spicy pepperoni slices. They have English-language menus available, a modest wine list, a nice decor, comfortable general ambiance and it was very busy both times I was there (a Saturday night, around 22:00 and a Tuesday evening, around 19:00).However, you must be wondering why I didn't rate this place with 5 stars... The answer is very simple: They serve you the wine in small ""water glasses"". And they're not even the nice kind of water glasses... I'm talking about the cheap, ugly kinds that you buy a dozen for 0,50€ at a discount store. Germany is a country of very strict laws and they should make one where restaurants are not allowed to serve wine unless they are served in wine glasses. In fact, it should be a crime to not serve wine in a proper wine glass! Specially in an Italian restaurant! I would not be surprise if Italy, along with every wine producer and sommelier in the world does not decide to rage war against this place. It was really an abomination when the waitress placed a glass of red wine on my table using that horrid glass. I immediately asked for a proper wine glass. The waitress on Saturday night promptly gave a ""you're not the only one to ask smile"" and brought a proper wine glass. Unfortunately, the waitress from Tuesday night said there were no more proper wine glasses available even though I was seated right in front of the bar and could clearly see at least 8 clean wine glasses in the shelf...

https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-osteria-hamburg,3.0,"We went here twice in one day!  For dinner was actually because a handful of other restaurants seemed to be closed and we wanted a menu with a variety of menu options.  Earlier that Monday the whole team went here for lunch.  My german team told us that the pizzas here are huge, so one of my collagues and I shared a caprese pizza (they gave us both one half).  I enjoyed the fresh table bread they provided.  Service during the day was better than when we went at night.  The caprese pizza was alright, but had just one small little ball of mozzarella and one teeny basil leaf on each slice.  I would have expected more.  As others have mentioned, the toppings are on the sparse side.  I also ordered a side salad, so I only ended up eating one slice of pizza and taking the rest to go.When we came back for dinner later that night, they were very busy but we were able to get a table by the door.  I had ordered a tomato shrimp gnocchi dish, the girls had ordered an artichoke cream soup and a special crawfish pasta.  We all ended up sharing even though my main dish was the gnocchi.  The portions here are huge again, even more so with the pasta.  The gnocchi were very pillowy and filling.  I actually enjoyed the light cream sauce crawfish pasta more, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish.  And the artichoke cream soup was refreshing.  Again, since they were so busy, we had to keep asking for several things.  But it's honestly not a bad option for a cheap Italian meal.  Dishes top around 12-13 Euro.",2016-02-20

We ordered shrimps with garlic pizza which tasted fantastic. I was actually shocked by how big the pizza is over there.The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because my friend was drinking from a glass that was broken and he got his lips cut, and when they replaced the glass, the new glass was also broken.

The folks there were super nice but I believe either Turkish or something else Middle Eastern. You could tell from the sushi pieces that this place was made for German palates where it's more about filling you up than delivering high end fish. Sure there is a crowd for this and they obviously like this place. If that's your thing, you'll be happy here. I believe the quality is OK and you could do worse. If you are into good sushi though, you may want to go up a class or two in sushi joint. It really is a totally different eating experience getting higher quality stuff.

Asked If we are in first time. Explained all options of the menu (in really perfect German). Some of the food is vegetarian, but can be ordered with broth. In this case, broth is made of bones - no longer vegetarian at all. Good to now but anyway - bone broth, sounds really good!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because most of the people here are Asians.

Our server was the absolute worst part of the entire night. She was slow and when we asked what was in the twenty-five euro bento box she said ""I have no idea! What do you mean?""Then we asked her politely if she could find out what was in it, and she said, ""what?"" By this point I was already so annoyed. When she came back she really put the cherry on top of the sundae was telling us ""the bento box comes with salad, a miso soup, and rice of course!""

https://www.yelp.com/biz/zum-sp%C3%A4tzle-hamburg,5.0,"Can't recommend this place enough. I lived my whole life in Bavaria but had to move to Hamburg to finally get some real handmade quality Spätzle again! In Augsburg, where I come from, it's gotten pretty hard to get good old fashion Käsespätzle because a lot of places turned into tourist-traps.Zum Spätzle is a very small and cozy place. It was cold outside so the warm and humid atmosphere inside was extra cozy. And with the smell of Käsespätzle in the Air I felt like visiting my grandmas ""gute Stube"". Everything is locally sourced and hand made. Especially the information about the Eggs coming from a farm where the male chicks are not killed was very valuable to me. There are dishes for vegetarians and vegans as well. So chose your Spätzle with Meatloaf or Tofu. I have not tried the Maultaschen, yet. But I sure want to do that someday.Both times I ate there I had a Spätzle dish. First time Käsespätzle with Meatloaf and brown onions was like my dream. Although I prefer my Meatloaf a bit more on the chunky side. This was almost too smooth. But everything tasted flawless, perfect balance of Spätzle and Cheese, the Gravy was to die for. Second time I had Käsespätzle ""pure"". What can I say, I love them. High quality for reasonable prices and you can get a free Spätzle-refill If you're not stuffed yet. Which you will want but can't manage to eat.Service is nice and chilled and asks for dessert & coffee in the best way without being pushy. Which is a quality I like very much. Lastly the place is so cosy with lots of pillows, natural wood, warm light and the smell of my childhood. At my grandmas or at a small cottage-restaurant were my parents used to take us to eat after we went hiking at the Alps. I recommend making a reservation if you want to eat there in the evening. I got lucky both of the times I went there. But I will visit again and again and I can not recommend enough to go and try it. Even If you are a tourist from Bavaria!

I've been there twice now and the issue is the feel. I felt treated by the hostess not like a customer that should be treated friendly and be welcomed but rather like someone who is lucky to even make it into the door. We got there a few minutes before opening time (10 am for a breakfast place -- weird by itself) and stood in line. She let in about a dozen people. When it was our (my daughter and I) turn she assigned us ""the couch"". Folks that came after us still got tables.  We went to the couch which is an old style leather couch with an old suitcase as table. Very uncomfortable. As we sat there uncomfortably, tables got served first. In addition there were at least 4-5 tables unused. So I went back to her and asked why we were sent to ""the couch"" whereas folks that came right after us got a table. Begrudgingly she said that we could take a table but that they all were reserved, some starting at 11 am, some much later. It was 10:15 am! We didn't plan on spending an hour there so took the table. We noticed several of the other unused tables had ""reserved"" on them with the time of reservation up to 12:30 pm!! Crazy! Anyway, we had our coffee and food (avocado toast which was tasty) and were out of there by 10:50 am. It's poorly managed in terms of seating, with a super snooty attitude from the hostess. Unwelcoming. A few suggestions: drop the attitude and treat people nicely. Get rid of the couch and add more tables. Get rid of the reservation deal for 2-4 people.

The owner was seated outside and seemed bothered that I was only there to eat food, not drink alcohol.  I was the only person in the restaurant so I would think my business would be appreciated. After a somewhat heated discussion about why I should order drinks whenever I go to any German restaurant, Claudia apologized and her smile came out, which was lovely. The waiter was young and jovial. Food: Dinner was great. Close to an entire rack of spicy-honey ribs, a small salad with sprouts, crispy potato wedges with sour cream and chives, and two pieces of perfectly grilled garlic bread. I don't even like garlic bread and I devoured the entire meal. A lot of food, a lot of great food for 990Euro. The ribs were overcooked in the slightest but not enough to warrant losing a star.

I fear ""Sushi Circle"" falls into the latter category. To avoid rambling on in generic terms, here's what I didn't like about Sushi Circle's sushi experience: - The Rice/Vinegar ratio. The rice was tasteless, non-sticky, and the nigiri was falling apart. - The fish.With fresh fish, my teeth sink into the sushi. With this stuff, I needed to put up a fight. - The service.If I ask for nigiri without wassabi wedged between the rice and the fish, do I have to wait half an hour? - The selection. ""All you can eat"" rounds are not always known for their marvelous selection, but having 4 types of sushi on the conveyor belt is rather poor. - The seating.Sushi circle's establishment is built in such a way where you need to squirm and crawl to get out of your seat, or to allow others to pass by you.

The location is right next to the Altona Bahnhof, so convenient to come with the S1.Even though the restaurant was quite busy, we were seated right away. All the dishes on the menu have pictures, so just point to whatever looks good. For me it was the Döner Teller mit Kalb for € 8,50. There was no beer on the menu (or I couldn't find it), so I picked the closest thing, a big Apfelschorle. It certainly looked like a beer when it arrived with a nice beer head.The food was very tasty. The Döner meat was grilled and tasty and all the sides (yogurt, tomato, cucumber, onion, rice, etc.) were very good as well.

A very laid back vibe, even if on Friday/Saturday nights it can get rather busy. Prices are fair (2.40 for an Astra). They usually spin good music, which is just loud enough to have a conversation over. The lighting adds to the atmosphere and the large glass windows makes it a good place to watch whats going on on the street from the comfort of an old couch ;).

Later they brought the wrong cakes for two of us (taking notes sometimes makes sense!) and kind of blamed us for it. We eventually took that cake to avoid a scene but it didn't taste very good. We were never asked if we want more coffee or drinks, the Apfelschorle I had wasn't really cold (it had almost 40C outside) and ice cubes seem to be unknown to them. When a motorcycle parade passed the restaurant, they refused to close the door, so we couldn't have a conversation for 15+ minutes due to the noise.

(Quick tip: ALWAYS bring the drinks ASAP and ALWAYS before the food- that way it's more likely that a second drink will be ordered; thus making more money and maybe more tips.)The food however was good and the portions large but nothing out of this world.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/sch%C3%B6nes-leben-speicherstadt-hamburg-2,3.0,"I was having a nice stroll as I often do in this gorgeous Hafencity I live in, and stumbled up this cafe, tucked inside a brick building around the corner from the Speicherstadt.  The decor really draws you in because there pasty case boasts a nice selection of desserts alongside a bar that opens up to a seating area blended into a mini gift shop filled with books, cards and such. I chose a window seat so that I could not only peek outside but get an overall view of the room.  Great place to lounge with friends because the layout is open and cosy. It feels more like you are sitting in someone's home dining table than in a cafe/restaurant. The meals range from light and healthy to rich and hearty homemade dishes.  I happened to be in the mood for wine and a dessert so I ordered the Kaiserschmarrn.  The wine was very nice, she suggested a glass of French,  Côtes du Rhône.  I really love this dessert, Kaiserschmarrn tastes to me similar of a thick pancake but with the sweet flavors of a sugary donut and served often with a side of berries or sauce.  My favorite is when they serve it with vanilla ice-cream, a dopple of whip cream and sprinkled with a few fresh strawberry slices. Here it was served mainly plain and a bit overcooked and too sugary.  I ate it nonetheless, but would it have been a bit fluffier and moist, I would have enjoyed it more.There is a lunch buffet for those in the area looking for a quick stop, as most people frequenting this area are there for work or tourists taking in the many sights. The main menu is very German with a mixture of Austrian and Northern traditional Hamburg recipes served. Meat and fish are the main components and though it is not an extensive menu of options, there are enough fine choices and it really does feel like a home cooked meal and atmosphere. Prices are a bit higher for such a cosy looking cafe, but I imagine it has much to do with the location being nestled in the main Harbor and historical landmark of the warehouse area.I had the Hamburger Pannfisch once for lunch and it was delicious.  This location is really great to go with a friend for cafe and dessert or even a nice quiet dinner if you happen to be in the area or it is also great for going alone and relaxing with your own thoughts after a nice walk along the Speicherstadt.  During the day, a good spot for a casual meeting on one of the sofas near the window.",2012-05-16

Mind you, we had been there barely ten minutes, not spoken much and I had never met this couple before in my life. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but considering my man and I were not fighting, nor were we having an argument or any other sort of spat, it was somewhat uncalled for and very rude. I know many people think they are so great at reading people, but trust you YOU ARE NOT. So before you think you can go get involved in others lives, maybe think twice.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/vienna-hamburg,5.0,"I walked the streets for over an hour finding this place and working up my appetite. Upon entering, I saw a bustling, too busy for words or greetings staff doing what needed to be done to satisfy the already packed house.But then... appeared in the doorway between the bar and the first small dining room, a middle aged man with herring bone rimmed glasses and a chef's stature, looking like he belonged. Our eyes met and I moved slowly closer to him to question if they were still serving. (fear set in that it was after nine on a Saturday night with a packed house they would tell me they are out of food). The gentleman introduced himself as Sven, the owner and chef and pointed to a small table they obviously squeezed in for single diners like myself.A woman server quickly set the table, seated me and handed me tonight's menu. Hand written (by Sven himself) in German, I struggled to grasp just one dish to be recognizable. NOT! When the server returned, I asked her what alphabet this menu was written in? She said the chef writes the menu every night in his own handwriting, and she proceeded to read and translate in English the offerings of the night. All sounded incredibly creative and amazing, so my reply was, ""what is everyone raving about tonight?"" She suggested the Pepper Steak on a bed of Navy, Lima and Green beans. And the Swordfish Carpaccio. I asked her to wine pair the best of what was 'by the glass' and that she did. An Italian Rosé with the Carpaccio and a Portuguese Cabernet Sauvignon with the Steak.A whole lot more action and another glass of wine occurred and wow, oh wow what an amazing culinary and night on the town with Sven unfolded. I could go on and on here... it was my last night in Hamburg which is why I opted to dine in the best I could find. Well it turned out to be Sven's last night as he was 'moving on' (not retiring) but just done with this chapter of his life. Upon finishing my main course, Sven politely joined me at my table and told me his story of how he started the restaurant 33 year's ago. He pulled a delightful older man close to him and began kissing his bald head and telling me how much he loved this man. The man had been with the restaurant for 28 years as the kitchen coordinator/dishwasher/busboy and all 'round go-to man behind the scenes. It was obviously an emotional moment for both these guys.Sven gestured to the bartender to pour me another glass of wine (on the house) and continued his story about how the German government offers a €100,000 tax deduction if you've started a business and sell it at age 55. Sven proceeded to invite me out on the town with him for a few more drinks in the St. George district where he knew all the local pubs and lots and lots of people. He even walked me to the train station to make sure I got on the right train back to my hotel.Anyway... so much more to this story...Bottom line... I'm sure the quality of food coming out of this kitchen will sustain because the staff obviously loved Sven and were sad to see him go. The understudies in the kitchen are apparently who bought the restaurant and planned on changing nothing.I hope I run into Sven again someday... maybe in Portugal or the Azores!",2016-09-07

The food is marvellous and fairly priced for the quality, the table service is friendly and abundant, and the dining room, while small, is cozy rather than cramped.

I ate a mouthwatering fish soup for starters, with homemade chips and a tangy remoulade on the side  great combination. Following that, and sticking to my theme of seafood, I practically demolished the Skrei fillet with pumpkin crust on a bed of spinach, leaving only two small potato fingers on my plate. While a peek at the dessert menu proved tempting, we opted out as a result of feeling perfectly satisfied after entrees and main courses.

Tucked in a pretty, quieter part of Hamburg near the Hummel statue, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the servers (not all spoke English, but were more than happy to get their coworkers who did, and English menus were available) were friendly and even attentive - not terribly common in Germany! You don't have only one server - the whole team is ready to help you. We were excited to try a craft Pils rather than something from the big breweries, so we ordered a few glasses. After a few inquiries we made our selections from the menu. I wanted to try a dish more local to Hamburg and our server helpfully pointed them out to me - all different herring dishes. I asked which she would recommend and she very helpfully told me that the Eingelegte Bratheringe (a fried herring dish) had started marinating that day, so it wouldn't really taste the way it should until it had marinated overnight and therefore suggested the Heringstopf - a dish with marinated herring fillets in a housemade cream with onions and apples. It came with Bratkartoffeln (fried potatoes) and salad. It was delicious but extremely rich. I couldn't finish it because we had ordered an appetizer (a very tasty goose terrine). The boy had pork schnitzel which came with a nice cucumber and cream salad that we didn't have in any other parts of Germany.

Luckily, we had one and were seated within a few minutes of arriving even though our party of 3 wasn't entirely here yet.The decor and ambience is certainly unique. In a good way, that is. The walls are decked out with what seems like a random collection of flea market finds, and the entirely unrelated music selection works to complete the experience. The waiters are also super high energy and witty, with an almost relentless desire to practice their heavily Italian-accented English. Our table was in a back corner, which made it easy to chat despite the somewhat loud setting. I'm not sure if that would also apply with the more central tables in the space.My friends recommended the pizzas over the pastas, and that seemed to match past reviews as well as what I saw around me. I got the Prosciutto e Funghi pizza. It's probably the best pizza I've had in Hamburg: really thin dough that's nicely charred from their wood-burning oven with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. These pizzas are huge, probably over 14"" in diameter, but the thin dough and toppings makes for a lighter meal than your typical, smaller pizza.At the end of the meal, they drop off the check along with bottles of grappa and sambuca and shot glasses for you to pour away. It's a nice way to end the meal even if the gesture felt a little robotic.

The pluses are that the atmosphere is always cool, the seating is good and the view is interesting (so long as you like shipping). The main minus is that the sand is dirty and full of cigarette butts. The beer is kinda expensive, but cheaper than the other beach clubs.",2009-06-05

This way you get a little taste of everything so when you decide to come back again you know exactly what you want. The spices, the textures, the flavors, it all combines in your mouth and it leaves you wanting more. Even if your mouth has a 4 alarm fire going on you can wash it down with a cool, creamy, mango lassi! The cold yogurt drink put the fire out while still being able to enjoy the flavors you love.

The exhibitions stretch over nine stories with additional smaller exhibitions on various sub-floors in between.

We happened to walk in on a presentation of a container ship simulator that let you slowly, painstakingly experience what it's like to drive a large container ship along a canal leading to the harbour. It's slow. It's arduous. I thought it was incredibly boring (the simulator, not the presentation) but apparently people spend hours at home playing with these simulators. And enjoy it. For some reason.I loved the miniature ship exhibition. Thousands of miniature ships spanning several centuries of ship building and design. The piracy exhibit was also quite interesting, while the rooms on the slave trade (including a piece of an actual slave ship showing shakles and chains) and plague ships were quite harrowing though still really well presented.All the history of human activity on the seven seas seems to be brought together in this amazing building.

On a sunny day, we saw seats outside and decided to try it out for lunch. We had some wine, a pizza and noodles with gorgonzola and bacon. First and foremost, the prices here are a joke. I live in the area so I know it's not cheap around here. At the same time, the prices here are higher than everywhere around and the portions are smaller. The pizza is a decent size but they forgot one of the ingredients. Further, it was thin-crust but mushy and wet. Nothing crunchy or appealing about this dish. The noodles were bland and I think I counted about 15 pieces (in total) of penne. This as a main course and for something like 12 Euros. The pizza for somewhere in the vicinity of 15 Euro for the ""large"" was ridiculous. The wine, also not cheap, was OK but nothing more. Finally, service was a joke. Slow is an understatement. Disinterested and unprofessional fits the bill.So, why two stars? Well, I really like the decor inside. It is well styled. Further, it's a nice location and if you are only coming in for a couple glasses of wine, fine. I'll give them two stars for deco and location. Otherwise, everything else is a joke.Finally, you better like snobs. The place is usually full of your usual Eppendorfer clowns. Pinks, greens, animal prints, silicon lips, LV bags and so forth.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/marsbar-hamburg,3.0,"Marsbar - for that little taste of Munich and Düsseldorf right in the west of Hamburg! I went there with a mate due to the simple fact that he likes the wine by the glass there. I hadn't visited the place before, because I know it's a favourite hangout of the Eppendorf Glitterati and hence doesn't exactly suit me down to the ground. Yet that evening at Marsbar turned out to be much more interesting than what I'd bargained for But first things first: the vain bodybuilder-cum-waiter is in place, as is an abundance of the cashmere-clad wealthy. It can get rather crowded, even though Falkenried isn't exactly the cosiest of places - but to see and be seen is apparently of much greater importance than an inviting atmosphere to many. As it got dark, things got a lot more interesting: there was the loud, aging gold-digger (-turned-wife?), whose favourite pastime seems to be shouting names in her loudest voice, especially when she sees a rather well-known German TV chef sitting at the other end of the terrace. After a few more people's names she changed her approach and screamed the names of some holiday resorts. Needless to say, her voice was of the shrill kind and hard to overhear. Yet Madmoiselle Namedropper wasn't the lady that left the biggest impression. That honour must go to a 40-something, sitting together with a bunch of obviously well-off friends, having a glass of wine. So far, so unimpressive - if it wasn't for the fact that she was obviously at her 15th glas and pissed senselessly. At first I thought it was some kind of candid camera comedy performance, but any sense of fun was lost when she, still sitting on her chair, fell to the side, not moving for a few seconds. One could hear a needle drop for a few moments, until a waiter (not Jean-Claude van Damme's bigger brother, but another, friendlier one) came to her rescue. And this was when I really couldn't believe my own eyes: not only couldn't her friends be arsed to help her, they also didn't feel bothered to take her home and to bed, preferring to stay until last orders instead. While Ms Boozer was still babbling and swaying relentlessly. I guess the Eppendorf Glitterati have their own etiquette It may be unfair that this grotesque evening will forever dominate my impression of Marsbar, but a bar is very much defined by its costumers. And, based on this visit, I have to say they're a strange lot. Apart from that I can commend their Ginger Ale (served with ice and a slice of orange!) and mint tea - the drinks selection in general seems to be decent, tough not exactly cheap.

If you've walked along Gertigstrasse at any point on a beautiful and warm evening you will notice that Deseo is one of two very popular tapas restaurants that are always seemingly buzzing. The vibe here is definitely more upscale than Arcada, just a half block down, and it's also reflected in the prices. The food here is very good though and very much worth a go.A reservation almost seems mandatory when dining on the weekend, and I would highly recommend it. Having made our reservation just a couple days prior, my wife and I studied and salivated over the menu, pretty much knowing exactly what we'd order once we arrived. We started off with complimentary bread, aoili and olives, which all of were great. We then proceeded to order the pimientos de Padrón, goat cheese with potatoes, chorizo, bacon-wrapped dates, prawns in garlic oil, and calamari in garlic oil. Every dish we had was savory and delicious; ones that I would definitely order again.Service was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice here as my wife and I indulged on our ""desired"" dishes and observed life passing from our window-bar seating.",2016-05-23

The single waiter than handled my room was a gentleman - thoughtful, professional, and capable of a laugh at the sight of a child (a family was dining that night).  The greeting woman seemed quite similar - a bit serious at first, but clearly very kind if you needed help.So the atmosphere was excellent, but the food actually topped it.  This is no neighborhood comfort food.  After picking out an incredibly inexpensive (but good) wine for me, the waiter brought out a complementary plate of variations on a pumpkin theme - ice cream, custard, pumpkin slices, etc, all prepared differently and all wonderful.  After a salad came the crusted duck dish. It was one of the best duck dishes I've ever had - full of flavor and wonderfully prepared.  I also had an excellent desert, but I can't recall it any longer.In sum, Landhaus Scherrer is a real find for a visitor of Hamburg.  I hope it's well-known by the locals.  Regardless, all who visit or live in Hamburg should stop in.",2010-11-13

The place was busy enough for a Sunday evening. Sat down at the table at 5:45 and ordered food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly enough but then it went downhill. At 7:00 we still had no food. Our waitress noticed this and went to find out about our food and came back to tell us they forgot our order! As our hunger levels were high and we were in such a bad mood with the service we asked for the bill for the drinks so we could go somewhere else. The waitress apologised and didn't charge us for the drinks. In fairness, I don't think it was all her fault. There wasn't enough staff working for the amount of people in the place. All the staff that were working looked stressed out and were running all over the place serving people. This might have had something to do with their rudeness! If they had more staff working things would probably run more smoothly. I've family and friends visiting Hamburg next month and wanted to take them here but I'm not going to now. It's a shame because the place is really nice and the food that I did see on other tables looked really good.",2011-03-07

Our reservation had requested a seat by the window so we can enjoy the view but we were seated at a table next to a table by the window; we asked if we could take the empty one by the window but were told the table was reserved. It actually remained empty the whole time we were there, so that was a disappointment.We ordered the Chateaubriand for two which comes with a total of four sides and two sauces, so we got the asparagus, broccoli, roasted veggies and truffle fries. As you can see we tried to even out the meat with all the veggies. For the sauce we got the truffle and lobster - both were rich and full of flavor, but we both liked the truffle one best. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and was flavorful and tender. The sort-of table side service (since the steak is cut in the dining room but at a special station vs next to your table) made it seem quite fancy. For dessert we got the coconut sorbet sans ""Happy Birthday"" message despite hubby making the request with our reservation.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/clouds-hamburg-2,2.0,"Clouds is a beautiful place to have dinner or drinks and I have been there several times. The food and cocktails are always delicious and I would say that they are worth the high price. As a grand finale to my mother's visit from abroad (and first time in Hamburg) I took her to Clouds the night before she flew the 27 hours home. Unfortunately this time I was utterly disappointed and have a particularly bad taste left in my mouth as a result of the service and tipping rationale. Our 'personal' waitress was abrupt and argumentative from the beginning when we simply asked if there were any tables by the window free. She then presented herself as our sommelier saying she could absolutely recommend the perfect wine to match our dishes and went on to dismiss the whole wine list and suggest merely the most expensive red and white wines on the menu. As a wine scientist I found this incredible considering the wine list has many options, and plenty that would have been a far better match. When attempting to discuss the wines with her she was dismissive and simply told me I was wrong by saying that Spätburgunder is the same variety of grape as Pinot Noir. I strongly recommend that your waitresses are trained in wine service (at least) before they claim to be sommeliers.Despite feeling hustled throughout our dinner we enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the restaurant. When it came to the bill I found the cost of the meal and a section below to rate our experience. Having not ticked a rating the waitress pushed me define if I was satisfied, happy or ecstatic with the experience. I was more than happy to give them a rating but found it staggering that the rating was accompanied by a percentage tip (already calculated from the total cost of the bill). Although I thoroughly believe in tipping when it is deserved and intended to tip for this meal too, being forced to tip is uncouth and a significant faux pas on the behalf of the restaurant management (who incidentally, were on holidays and not available to speak to on the night we were dining). My advice - train your staff in wine, don't force the tipping with satisfaction ratings on the bill.",2015-09-01

We were told that area wasn't open for another 2 hours but we stayed to take in the great view and plan our next moves. When I approached the bartender (Dougie sp?) to discuss our options, he quickly provided menus for drinks and food, not at other places, but at Clouds. I finally got it that it was fine to stay and he was incredible with prompt beers, two bottles of wine, snacks and food. He even provided a complimentary strawberry champagne drink and nachos. He made our afternoon even more delightful and was another wonderful example of the welcoming attitude of the great people of Hamburg. Don't miss enjoying Clouds!

Not only there was a lack of tvs on the roof terrace but also they just managed to hang the tvs on the walls barely on time since ""the owner took the key home, where the tvs were stored"". The menu was an A4 laminated piece of paper which I found totally inadequate for a place where you pay on average 10 EUR per drink. Not only was the staff completely rood and unfriendly they also overcharged us on the bill and made fun of the fact that we were an english speaking group and did not tip them for the reasons stated above.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/butchers-hamburg,5.0,"I am going to go ahead and give this place five stars. I'd be tempted to dock them one star due to the exorbitant pricing but to be honest, it's almost worth it. Yes, they are expensive and even more importantly, yes you knew this coming here. If you really think you are going to see this menu and not find it expensive then you shouldn't be here in the first place.Now, on to the food. Great, great steaks. Presented as steaks should be.....raw and on a platter for you to choose your cut. I had the ribeye (400g) which had a perfect blend of fat and meat and ordered it medium rare as quality meat should be cooked. Perfect.....not one complaint and I finished almost every last scrap of this cut, which very smartly came out on a hot plate......dislike when they don't do this with larger cuts as it cools off too quickly before you can finish it. The sides were just as good. We had the spinach, the beans with bacon and the steamed vegetables. Perfect.....everything just as I like it.Service is also top notch. We did seem to constantly have different people coming to the table...one for orders of starters, one for the order of drinks (bottles of wine in our case), one who brought the first course and so forth. Yet, everyone was super nice. Really liked this.One side note......and this is not meant negatively. I ordered some barbecue sauce to try it with the meat. This barbecue sauce was horrendous. I absolutely hated it. Yet, it doesn't mean it was bad. It just wasn't my style and I talked with the guy who seems to run this place about this. I very clearly told him I hated it but it didn't interfere with my meal at all. I was lucky I didn't pour it over my steak. One tip: simply keep the sauces on the side and try them before drenching your steak in them. You may love them. I didn't.Finally, if someone isn't going to eat steaks don't come here with them. My g/f for example doesn't eat steaks. Hence she won't be seeing the inside of Butchers. Don't get me wrong....I'd love to take her here but it's a waste.

The video footage was also complimented by very sad violin music. The rest of the exhibition was a weeks worth of viewing, and expressive pieces that told us truths about China.

There's also a full coffee and tea menu, a few cakes, and an ice cream section.I had the ""Den Burger"", which is some sort of play on words that escapes my feeble German. It's a lentil patty on a bun with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, ketchup, and some kind of basil cream. It comes served with too few sweet potato fries, and an extra little plate of the basil cream. The burger itself is quite large and filling, and actually pretty tasty. The condiments seemed like too much at first, but when you realize how dense and large the patty is, you're glad to have something to dip it in. The fries are pretty fantastic, but again, there aren't enough of them.To say I was apprehensive about trying Froindlichst would be an understatement. Aside from being a vegan restaurant (a category I mostly avoid), there were a few warning signs. First, my wife had made a reservation online, but when we arrived there wasn't a table set aside for us. Fortunately, there were plenty of empty tables, but this seemed like an opportunity for disappointment. Second, the service was perfectly friendly, but when we placed our order, the sound of juicy burgers hitting the grill didn't exactly emanate from the kitchen. Laid back, they are.

My fascination with these relics of the cold war stems mainly from enjoying ""The Hunt for Red October"" so much. U-434 is a Soviet vessel dating from 1976. She is a Tango-class (NATO designation) attack boat, armed with 24 torpedoes. Powered by 3x 5200 shp 6 cylinder diesels, she was, I believe, the largest non-nuclear submarine in service at the time. A German businessman thought it would be a good idea to buy her for around EUR1M in 2002, and she was transported back from Russia for a further EUR1M and now lies in Hafen City. Admission is around EUR12 with an extra EUR3 for the guided tour, which ou can have in English. I highly recommend the extra tour as you get to see areas of the boat (command room etc.) that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. Sadly, as she was still in active service as a training boat until 5 years ago, the Ruskies removed quite a bit of equipment from her before she was sold. Therefore, you won't be plotting a firing solution as the torpedo computer has gone, along with sonar and communications. For the most part though this is as authentic as it gets.

I was creeped out a lot more than I thought - it's a really tight and dark space with terrible gas fume smells. There's a loud engine room, but the rest of the space has fake sonar ping audio being piped in. There's little camera lenses cut into various walls so the people in the office can watch you as you browse through, but other than that, you're free to go at your own pace - provided there's enough room for others to squeeze by.

There is no system though to getting seated and people who came after us were seated before us. We also weren't given seats across from one another as requested but instead were seated next to one another in a bench seat area which was way too small to squeeze into as it was abutted up on to the wall next to it. Finally, once seated, everyone is so close that every word you utter is within earshot of six other people. Intimate seating for sure....if you want to be intimate with everyone around you. The ordering process is also quite inefficient. In hindsight, as two people, we should of ordered everything on one machine and with one card.

Four is enough to offend and halt an angry Water Buffalo at full waddle.Then the green beans were cooked squishy and had heavy butter. What happened to steaming so there is still a firm bite? And the steak sauce was an odd concoction of tomato cocktail sauce with onions??? For my premium steak? A horseradish Mayo with steak drippings would have been more interesting for a house steak sauce...The fries?

When we left around 8 PM there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant. Seating at the restaurant would be hundred plus. There were two of us for dinner, my wife had a tenderloin steak, which she said was quite tender and fairly tasty. I had a ribeye steak that was extremely tough. The manager came over and inquired about our meals and when I indicated that the steak was tough he did offer to make another steak for me. That was probably the best thing about the meal. The side salad was run-of-the-mill. The baked potato was nothing special. In a city known for its potatoes one would think that the potato would be something extraordinary. Think again.

There were a number of options for the amount of courses to partake in, five to be exact, and we opted for the 7 course degustation which really came out to 11 courses after the amazing amuse bouche and dessert extras.1st beef tartare-cucumber-gin: tasty and very well balanced, also came with two pieces of steak to grill on a tiny personal grill.2nd prawn-pork belly-couscous-saffron: excellently prepared prawn over fork-tender pork belly and savory fine couscous, it was one of my favorites.3rd stuffed cabbage-truffle-truffle jus: this dish was completely covered in decadent truffle shavings. 4th pineapple vanilla sorbet-champagne: excellent palate cleanser before the main.  5th iberico pork-truffle-celery-almonds: our main course had so many different delicious elements to it, my wife called it ""a journey on a plate""...apt.6th aperol spritz to eat: amazing frozen aperol with a lot of sweet and delectable surprises in it like fruit and candied things.7th frozen goat cheese-tarragon-white chocolate-olive oil: sensational dessert that was almost too pretty to eat and despite many of the savory elements, it was still quite sweet and was easily one of my most favorite desserts ever. 8th birthday cake!One thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the fact that we weren't really sure how everything was going to taste ahead of time.

I don't eat out a ton but, when I do, it's with the expectation of having an experience that I couldn't easily replicate at home (for half the cost and no travel time).We went to TrüffelSchwein to celebrate Valentine's Day. Even though it fell on a Sunday (when they're normally closed), they opened up for the special day and had a custom menu going. The dishes were mostly pulled from their regular menus with some customizations here and there. Still, points for opening on Sunday and printing a themed menu.Ambience: perfect. The dining room is intimate but gives each table enough room to have its own conversation. They have an outdoor space, but it was (1) February in Hamburg and (2) pouring rain. I'm sure it's amazing in the summer, though. The decor is relaxed upscale, not that I'm-rich-look-at-me feel that you'll find in most other Michelin-rated restaurants in Hamburg. It's classy yet comfortable, a nice-jeans-and-blazer vibe. For the occasion, they had rose petals on the tables, a perfectly elegant touch.Service: nailed it. That alone earns them their Michelin star for me. Their timing and delivery are impeccable. They're there to top off your water or wine seconds before you realize you need a refill. The courses are perfectly spaced out and presented. They give you space to enjoy your dining experience but magically show up moments before you even notice you need something. When our waitress heard us speaking English (and clearly butchering any German we spoke with her), she smoothly switched over to English without any hesitation. When we continued in German ('cause we're stubborn fools), she switched back again without missing a beat. Top notch professionalism, folks.Food: everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and superbly plated. We went for the 4-course menu paired with gin martinis and a white wine, which was just the perfect amount. That menu includes a bread basket with truffle butter and tapenade and two amuse-bouches.When it comes to higher-end restaurants, TrüffelSchwein is absolutely worth the splurge, more so than the 185€ you'd have to shell out at Haerlin just for food in my book.

Second group, the first two pages in the menu are for you!There is much variety to choose from, with a spiciness warning for most of the authentic dishes. Portion sizes are very generous - obviously you'll have more fun as a group to share Chinese-style, otherwise this will likely be a very meat-focused experience. The pork belly dish I sampled tasted really good, rich and fatty as it should be, nicely seasoned.Don't worry too much about the spiciness warning - even at the highest rating, the food remains nicely edible.

Not only is it grossly overpriced, but the quality doesn't even remotely justify it. We had to send back some buffalo wings that weren't cooked through. My burrito tasted like a wet sponge. My meal was bland and strange. Nothing had flavor except the salad dressing (which I regretfully discovered too late as a potential flavor enhancer). I've been to many Mexican restaurants in the Americas, from lavishly expensive to hole-in-the-wall family operations. Most all of them were splendid. Mexican food is actually very hard to screw up. But either I was mistaken and Sausalitos is not a Mexican restaurant, or like other Mexican restaurants in Germany it suffers the same curse German restaurants do in America: only still in business by virtue of their novelty. Service:People skills were sorely lacking. I got my coffee with a creamer that turned out to be empty; it had been reclosed, likely by the patron who whitened his or coffee with it earlier that day. The server was in no way apologetic or surprised by that. It also tells me something about what the restaurant does to save money when clearing tables: scavenging peoples dishes for reusable items.

Our order was taken promptly by a friendly waiter and off we went to the buffet. I was quite happy to see pancakes and bacon as well as two types of eggs (scrambled and soft boiled). For the Brits there were sausages and beans, as well. The ""make your own"" waffles were a big hit with my kids and husband. The buffet also had the typical German breakfast items, such as Brötchen, assorted breads and toast bread, cheeses, meats, jams, jellies, cream cheeses, yogurts, etc. I also enjoyed the more lunch-y items: chili, wraps and steamed veggies. All of us finished our brunch off with a giant portion of fresh fruits. The food was good, well-prepared and quickly replenished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The brunch costs just under 15€ and includes a prosecco, a warm drink and an orange juice - quite a bargain, I think.

Also the burritos looked huge and I knew we would fill up on chips and guac and wouldn't be able to finish our burritos later.The wait was a bit long for our burritos. Looks like there is only one chef handling all the orders. There is a sign on a chalkboard letting customers know that the wait can be long so at least they acknowledged this. The burritos arrived after about 15 to 20 min. They are not served in tinfoil and looks like they are grilled on a panini press and then finished in the oven. I am from San Francisco so I expect all my burritos to be in tinfoil unless its a wet burrito so I was weary when I saw the grill marks, the wax paper and the knife and fork. I cut into the chorizo burrito and it looked reasonable - lots of black beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, onions and chorizo. The flavors were good but different then my normal burrito experiences back in the Bay. We dosed the burritos in tapatio and habanero green sauce and that helped kick up the heat and flavors. The chorizo bits were a bit awkward they were a bit chewy and didn't mesh well with the other flavors going on in the burrito.All in all its an OK burrito spot.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/jim-burrito-hamburg,1.0,"I'm a native Californian.  I know Mexican food well. Sometimes I like it authentic. Sometimes I like it Americanized.  Being a native Californian it is likely I will eat Mexican food or a Mexican-inspired dish for at least one meal a day.  Which is why when I travel I find myself in Mexican restaurants in places like Germany or Scotland. I usually approach these places knowing that they will be pale comparisons to what I can get back home.  And it was with that in mind that I went to Jim Burrito. So when I say it was literally the worst burrito I've ever had, keep in mind that I wasn't expecting it to be as good as something from back home. What was so bad?  I got the Poblano covered burrito. The sauce tasted like dish soap. It was awful. The burrito's fillings were also very wet and lacking flavor. So basically I had a soupy soapy burrito.  The German friend I had with me tried a bite of my burrito after I refused to eat any more, and he also said it was awful.  As I looked around the place I noticed most people ordered the quesadillas. I'm sure that this much simpler recipe of cheese and a tortilla would have been a better choice, and should you find yourself dragged here by German friends, I recommend you keep it simple and order that.I think the most aggravating part of the meal though came when we went to pay.  We brought our dishes back to the counter, and in German the server/host treated us like we had offended him by not eating the awful burrito.  It was bad enough I had to pay for something inedible, but to be treated like we had offended them by not forcing ourselves to eat the awful meal, well that's just ridiculous.  I didn't make a scene, I didn't request the burrito be taken off the bill, instead I vowed silently to myself I'd write this review to warn other travelers away from this place.",2015-12-18

The burrito was just as good, well seasoned, perfected black beans, ungodly amounts of cheese. Oh BURRITO LORDS, WHY MUST I LIVE IN PRAGUE WHEN THIS SUBLIME TASTE OF TEX-MEX IS IN HAMBURG!?!?!? OH THE HUMANITY!!!!Added to this brilliant experience of burrito bliss, were the two lovely men working the smallish restaurant. I think I made the chef's day by singing the praises of this religious moment in my mouth. The only reason they don't get five stars is burritos need margaritas. Other than that, I will darken their door whenever I am in Hamburg.",2014-10-30

I was, for some reason, expecting to pick up the burrito and eat it like normal with my hands, but alas it was too overstuffed and soggy to do so. The mixture of the lettuce, rice, beans, and salsa tasted good, but the chicken lacked flavor. My hubby ordered the enchilada, which was a burrito smothered in mole sauce. The mole sauce was way too chocolatey, like milk chocolate was used in the sauce chocolatey.Yes, I know we live in Hamburg now and I shouldn't expect the same flavorful, meat and rice cooked in lard wrapped neatly in a heavenly package of greasy goodness...The place was quite crowded when we arrived but we were able to grab a booth in the corner.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/jim-burrito-hamburg,2.0,"Update: I'm going to have to mark Jim Burritos down a bit because they keep on disappointing. The food is generally still pretty good, although my last burrito was burnt from being left in the toaster far too long. I feel bad saying bad things about the place, but I think one member of staff in particular is rather dozy. She seems to have no idea who ordered what first. If she's on, you can walk in and order your food and then watch as streams of people who came in much later get their food first. Then when your food finally arrives (I have waited 90 minutes) you could very well be given the wrong order. I took two friends last week. We were the only people without food when we ordered, so I expected the three burritos to come quite fast, say in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, after watching plenty of other tables receive their food, we finally got ours. Mine was burnt. My friend was given a spicy one, when she'd ordered non-spicy. After a small complaint she was offered some extra sour cream. Instead of bringing it over, the staff went outside for a cigarette break. The sour cream never came and when we went to pay they had the nerve to overcharge us! Sigh. I still like Jim Burritos, and will continue to go, but I won't take visitors anymore, and I certainly will never go back on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday - they are just too slow.Old review: Pretty damn good burrito shop where the old Hatari cantina used to reside. We popped into Jim Burrito's last night - you've gotta try the new places, right? I got a beef burrito with guacamole for EUR6.50 (EUR5.50 without the guacamole). Their burritos come wrapped in tin foil, and so can be a bit of a pain to eat - I'd rather be given the option to have it straight onto a plate without all the foil.

First, it's not really a burger; they should rename it a sandwich, because it's just a fried fish sandwich. Second, my sandwich was absolutely drenched in Remoulade (tartar sauce), which made it a mess to pick up and eat. So I went after it with knife and fork (German-style), but that crushed the tender fish inside the bun, which made it less like eating a filet of fish, and more like eating a flattened fish paste. The fries were fine, almost great. Sauces for fries (mayo, ketchup) are extra, something I just don't understand. Total cost for sandwich, fries, mayo: 14 Euro.

The pâté had also good taste but I wished that it was a little bit richer. It felt a little bit dry, but this is probably normal when you consider that it's not pork-based pâté. Also strange was that my course was served without bread.The main course is where the disappointment happened. Both my wife and I had the cod served with spinach and seafood cannelloni. The skin of the fish wasn't crispy and the spinach was underwhelming. But worst of all were the two seafood cannelloni. Whoever made these should not be allowed to cook pasta again, it was really tough and I ended up leaving on the plate. Same with my wife and my neighbor at a different table. Overall this dish had potential but the execution was poor.Service was incredibly slow. The three first courses arrived at a good pace, not fast but it left time for us to enjoy the food, wine and conversation. But once we received our main courses, the waiters just seemed to disappear. We waited so long that in the end we decided to bypass the dessert and head home, because we didn't want to wait any longer. In the end, 3 courses took more than 2 hours.",2016-03-15
https://www.yelp.com/biz/atlas-restaurant-und-kochsalon-hamburg-2,3.0,"Atlas Restaurant is somewhat hidden in a relatively modern business district in the northwest of Altona. Like some of its surroundings, the restaurant oozes a bit of the red brick loft style that was so fashionable a decade ago. Unfortunately the dining room was rather empty on the evening of my visit, which - together with the empty (except for the cloth and a single candle) tables - made the place feel a bit barren. Service was fast and friendly throughout the evening and is one of Atlas' strong suits. The food, on the other hand, was a bit of a mixed bag. The evening menu is competitively priced (at 28 Euros per head) and includes three courses, which leads one to expect above-average, brasserie style cuisine. The salmon tartar starter was accompanied by pulpo, melted tomatoes and pickled cucumbers - a combination I personally didn't quite understand. The salmon tartar was decent, if a bit bland on its own, but how the other elements should be combined harmoniously eluded me, despite many attempts. The main, Boeuf Bourguignon, was better: the meat was tender and the sauce rich (in a good way), only the vegetables were slightly too tough.Desert was a lovely mousse au chocolate cake with pistacchio ice cream, which left very little to be desired, indeed. Atlas Restaurant is offering more than decent food at a good price. Maybe I'd just caught the wrong day of the week, but I'd probably not go there for dinner again, if the place is always as empty in the evening. Just in terms of food there is little to keep one from exploring the backyards of Altona.",2010-10-13

So, so good, and quite filling. Oh! And their garlic-chili condiment sauce is so good you practically want to eat it with a spoon.

More seasoned boiled water than broth. Noodles were not boiled soft enough for my taste but I understand that some people do prefer that over soft fresh noodles. Pho didn't come with fresh herbs on the side like usual so I was bummed out as well. I love bean sprouts in my pho.

It's the perfect cure for a hangover (see previous reviews of my Eurotrip). After a short amount of deliberations, Yelp brought us to Quán dò. The restaurant is conveniently located around the corner from the HBF and easy to find. We didn't spend much time studying the menu because it was in German. However, there was Vietnamese writing (no English?) next to the German item. It's not hard to find ""Bò tái - Rindfleisch ,medium'"" on the menu, especially seeing it on hundreds of other menus. I also ordered the Lychee lemonade to wash it down. Water is not free in Germany. You'll have to fork over some euros for stillwater. I was absolutely amazed to see water in glass bottles. They're pretty rare in America.The Bò tái was served Northern style for sure. The broth was very savory and the soup came with a Chinese fried dough. That's how they do it in Vietnam and it was great eating something authentic in a foreign place. If you are used to a plate of bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil, you are in the wrong place. That's Southern style.  Hamburg is certainly diverse enough to have a large population of Asians. Still we were missing some critical items to make our broth perfect. We asked for some red chilies because it lacked the spice we needed. The waitress gave us a bowl of chopped red chilies.

The pho here is different than most other Vietnamese restaurants: you don't get a side dish of bean sprouts, lime, chilis and herbs to add to you soup.This isn't a downside in my opinion, because the soup gets there fast and is beautifully satisfying.Since all the pho is 6.50 (a freaking steal if you ask me), I got pho tôm, which was pretty damn good. My friends all had Bún (pork, beef & tofu). I tried the tofu bún and it was truly amazing. I will probably get it the next time I'm here.

The entire Empire Hotel is chic, and the food is tasty and served with a bit of poshness as most trendy hotels usually incorporate into the overall experience.  The worst thing to discover with going to Lounge 20 Up is when a queue (or long line) develops to head upstairs to the bar area.  Either stand in line or enjoy a few cocktails at the hotel lobby level bar until the line dies down, then head upstairs.  The risk you run of not standing in the roped off line is that when you finally get upstairs, you might NOT easily find anywhere to sit, let alone stand on busier nights.   When it is crowded, you have little to no chance of actually getting close enough to the window to enjoy a city view, but if you finally manage to steal a table with a a view, the sight is gorgeous.. Floor to ceiling glass walls almost make you feel like you will fall.  If you are afraid of heights, your stomach gets a couple butterflies but you get over it pretty quick. Any tourist to Hamburg should come here just for the FREE view of the Harbor alone. What is not free, are the pricey cocktails!  I like to order the champagne mixed cocktails by the glass served in a flute, often with a gooseberry fruit garnish. Do not expect to dance here, it is mainly for cocktails and lounging, but since it is only a 10 minute walk to Reeperbahn, you can be at clubs, bars, other touristy attractions in no time.  It receives 5 Stars for the views of 20Up and the upscale trendy vibe of the hotel facilities and decor. Tip: There is a coat check but on busy nights, this is one of those establishments that frown a bit if you do not check your coat in and request to hold onto it.  You get a quick glance like, ""Oh, you want to hold onto your own jacket/coat?!""",2012-05-25

I've also had the benefit of eating steak in some of the best places in and outside of Germany hence my hurdle for quality meat is quite high. Hopi, located so close to my home, is unfortunately a disappointment. Having moved here recently I was looking for the occasion to try this place out. From the reviews here I was expecting to be wow'ed. Well, didn't quite happen. This is an older place and the interior is going downhill. Nicely maintained yet aging in terms of design. Even Block House with it's old school flair seems a bit more modern. Not a big deal though. This is a very subjective issue. Unfortunately where things went wrong for me was with the food. I had the ribeye steak. Prepared and served just like at Block House with the salad and garlic bread. The meat was horrible. I ordered it medium rare and it was gummy and bland. This was not good meat and if it were prepared by a gourmet chef would probably still not taste well. The garlic bread was ok but on the dry side. The salad very simple and the dressing forgettable. Don't get me wrong. For the cheap prices here, it's a good way to get your steak on. Once you've finished studying or received your first paycheck, it's time to move on. Yes, Block House is more expensive but the meat is consistent. Butchers, Meatery or the place in Afrikahaus are all better.On a side note, our waitress was super nice. We had the lady with the short, blonde hair and she really was a sweetheart. Unfortunately, the old guy (who I presume was the owner) was in the middle of a heated fight with the Asian lady at the end of the night.

After being a vegetarian for a year (and previously spending my time with either fellow vegetarians or kosher-keepers), I had very little experience with Hamburg's selection of meat. After much deliberation, our party of three decided to forego the ide of an upscale steak joint for Hopi - a much recommended, affordable steakhouse in Hoheluft-Ost/Harvestehude. Service was a bit slow to start with, but our meals arrived quickly. I had a ""Hopi Steak"", which was 8.90 for a 200g argentinian beef steak, a baked potato and a piece of garlic bread. The meat was okay - a solid slab of beef, but nothing exceptional. I found it very ""gummy"", hard to cut and chew. I'm not a meat connoisseur, so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about. I finished the meal off with a very yummy tartufo. Overall, I had a good, solid experience at Hopi and I'll be glad to come back.

There are plenty of places to sit, a dance floor downstairs, and a football/kicker table for a male testosterone match or teaming up on a date couple vs. couple or girls vs. boys :)I like this bar because the music is loud enough to listen to, but quiet enough where you can actually talk to people and socialize if you really want to.  They used to have this cool table in the center that had a neon glow with these fish shadows that swam around and they added just enough water on top to get your finger wet if you dipped it in to touch the screen.  People always played with it, because we thought you could control the direction the fish shadows would swim by touching the plexiglas screen, but i am not sure if that really worked or just mere coincidence, haha...People here dress a a bit more trendy than other bars in Schanzenviertel.  I feel this is where the preppy/casual crowd hangs out.  Overall, it is actually a good mixture of all different types and that is what I like, because there is always a different crowd every time I come here.  Sometimes older, sometimes younger, some in hooded sweatshirts and some in polos with Hamburg style red pants, and sometimes just all of the above.  It is also open late, so another reason for the popularity of the late night crowd.

It seems new, the staff is nice, and the food is good.The floor plan is a bit odd... the entrance is alongside the pizza kitchen, with a huge countertop and a giant red oven. Towards the back up a short flight of stairs is the dining room, which probably seats about 40 or 50 people, and is decorated in a minimalist, trendy way with plants growing in gutters along a side wall.The menu is mostly pizza, along with a few appetizers and a few salad options. They also have a pizza-based dessert which is chocolate raviolis made with pizza dough. We didn't try dessert on our first visit, but it will probably happen at some point. There is also a surprisingly long drink menu; everything from coffee and tea to beer and wine, and cocktails to boot.I ordered the special pizza, which was fennel sausage, roasted red pepper strips, and shaved parmesan. My wife had the portobello pizza, which has ricotta instead of tomato sauce, and is topped with mushrooms and truffle oil. Both were delicious and filling. There's a lot of advertising around to tell you this, but these are meant to be Neapolitan-style pizzas which are baked in a 400C oven for 90 seconds. As a result, the pizzas come out mostly cooked, but still a little watery, and the crust never gets terribly crisp. (I don't mind, but apparently this bothers other Yelpers.)In the ""How is it for kids?"" department, our daughter was greeted with a coloring book and a jar full of colored pencils, and when it came time to ordering, we were able to get her a smaller kinder-pizza withOUT (this is the most important part) any green seasoning (oregano) whatsoever.

Everything was soooooo good.  Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian but the meat substitutes that came on our eggs benedict was delicious even by my bacon-loving husband's standards. The service was very friendly, the price was right, the filter coffee was great and the venue was very cute and cozy. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were there right after they opened. So we will keep that in mind the next time we come back. All in all, I think this will become a favorite of ours in Hamburg. So excited to have found this place!",2017-08-12

https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamalicious-hamburg,3.0,"Update: I have to take this place down a notch. They are now vegetarian and everything which used to include meat now has some kind of tofu replacement or isn't on the menu anymore. This definitely takes them down a notch when it comes to many breakfast options.....bacon.....you can't take away bacon folks! It's a god-given right!Had breakfast here this morning with a friend and business partner and came away pleasantly surprised. There have been a lot of comments all over the place both on Yelp and Qype about this place. I had been at ""Don't Tell Mama"" in their previous location and really liked the cheesecake but service sucked and the location was a hassle for me. Had meant to come here forever but finally had the chance. I am finnicky about breakfast and very few places in Hamburg do it right. Mamalicious did a pretty good job. The eggs benedict were quite good as was a 3-egg scramble (with dried tomatoes and feta cheese). Coffee was tasty too. I had a fruit smoothie which was so so but I think it was more the mix of fruit verses anything else that didn't let it shine. All in all a nice location with outdoor seating as well (does get loud due to busy street right there). Service was really nice but we were first ones in the door in the morning and it wasn't that busy. Unfortunately, hash browns were out. No idea how something is already out right at opening and found this a bit odd but so be it. All in all we were happy with breakfast and enjoyed the place. I plan on coming back and hope not to find all the gripes which have been mentioned: too loud music, slow service nor missing food items, etc. This place is good but could very easily tip over to mediocre. As long as you get good service and they have everything available you should be happy with this place. Prices are a bit steep too but hopefully you're getting quality for that and they do use organic products (or so they say) and mention having a local, quality butcher for their meat. Let's hope that the second visit is just as good if not better.",2013-08-20

I recently was in Rhodes and comparing the food there and here at the Taverna -- I would say it can't get any authentic than this! My first time here I ordered the Calamari + Chicken soulvaki along with the white house wine -- best combination ever! The atmosphere is great-- really reminds me of Greece also with the loud conversations. The staff are great! We arrived but no tables were available so we had to wait but I believe who was the owner came over and accompanied us and asked if we would like something to drink while we waited! We were then promptly seated and the service is also very speedy here. What I would recommend is the Greek Bifteki -- it is ground meat with stuffed feta cheese, I think it is named differently on the menu-- just ask the servers!!! And with almost every dish you can get either french fries or rice and a greek salad.One thing that made me laugh were the napkins cause on the other side it is a mini-greek dictionary for you with phrases that I learned on my Greek trip!!! On our second time around, again busy as ever, no tables but we were then again asked if we wanted something to drink! This time I tried the octopus salad and the Grill platter (with assrt. meats) -- GREAT!!! YUMMY!!! But one thing I shouldn't have done was eat bits of the bread they place on the table -- the servings are plenty -- so you can always eat the bread after if you are not full from your main dish!Note to self: This place is very affordable (our bill for both outings for 2ppl plus drinks(bottle of wine and beers) and tip came to 25euros) and great location in Schanze! There are plenty of selections of meat, fish, vegetarian, pizza, pasta and salads. They also have some sort of German special also, just look at the daily special board. Oh and did I mention there is also a huge tv screen for all those sport lovers who are supposed to be on a date but can't keep their eyes off the screen;) I am going to try the moussaka next time and the guy next to our table had some sort of sizzling plate -- will have to try that also next time!!

They were reaching out for the apples that you can give to them, but there are these wires that keep them from falling off the edge of the animal encasement (which a big ditch separates them from where the people stand and watch) and they lean up against it to eat, and I can see the markings on their skin from all the leaning into the wire cables and that made me feel a bit guilty feeding them. The monkey display is very cool, you get to see Mandrills which are so beautifully colored but be careful, their hands like to grab anything that comes close to the cage (i.e camera cases, jackets, purses, etc...) and once they grab, it can be a struggle so if you happen to take a private back area tour, just keep this tip in mind!!!The orangoutangs are also very sweet, they have a big dome covering over their exhibit during colder winter months to keep them warm, but during Summer it is wide open and you can see them hopping around and dragging their blankets, playing with one another.  They seem quite happy!Overall, this is quite a nice local Zoo.  Basically when this zoo was build, the concept was not to ""cage"" animals but to let them roam in an open environment, so they use moats here instead of bars.  They have quite a display of animals and in some displays, they even mix animals like they are naturally done in the wild, but of course he does not mix hyenas with zebras!

If you come during the week, its nice to grab a high table behind the bar, order some world class drinks with fruits hanging all over the place that practically overwhelm the glass itself, and enjoy music with a friend and feel like you kinda went out, but without really doing it up too crazy. What is just okay about the place? Location, it is a bit of a walk unless you are driving by car or dropped off by taxi.  If you are wearing flat shoes, it is no problem at all, but if you are wearing heels and getting off at Jungfernstieg, then its a bit of a ""spazieren gehen"" lovely scenic walk as they might say in Germany.  At least you can walk up Ballindamm next to the lake, I mean the Alster just makes everything THAT much BETTER :)  The food is also just ""okay"" and they stop serving kinda early, considering most people like to drink and eat a bit later here, since it is busier between 7pm and 10pm, so if you try to come late to beat the cocktail rush, you also miss the opportunity to eat.The menu mainly consists of pizzas, salads, pastas and some general appetizers. The drinks really is the real reason most people come here and the music as they have a live DJ that spins good tracks.  For girls and even guys who are not shy to drink a cocktail with an elaborate fruit arrangement sprouting out of the glass, their specialty drinks here are nice to try and taste like an alcoholic dessert more or less. I sometimes am in the mood to enjoy a good martini, but I tried to order it here once and I was not crazy about it.  Martinis are not made equally in Europe vs. the US.  And funnily enough, James Bond was in international man of mystery who loved Martinis, so I wonder where he ordered his????",2012-05-26

https://www.yelp.com/biz/mash-hamburg-2,5.0,"I've already reviewed the London MASH restaurant so what more can I add here?Well, at the time of writing, this place was only a few weeks old in Hamburg. From my experience, these guys have really hit the ground running.The restaurant located in the smart and swanky harbour area of the city. From the outside and in, it looks and feels distinctly MASH. The glass front gives you views of the harbour but also opens up the restaurant and makes it feel quite spacious. The MASH bods have effectively split the space into two areas either side of the main doors and the cloakroom. The opulent bar is in keeping with the London offering - sleek, modern and stocked with a great range of spirits (especially whiskeys) and cocktails. The restaurant is is spacious and opens out into a second dining area at the back of the restaurant. So how does MASH Hamburg fare versus MASH London? I'd have to say, on this occasion I thought it was potentially better!! The service was faultless. As soon as they realised I was English, out popped the English menu and full service in English. The menu is identical but is actually even better value given that you pay the same in Euros as you do in Sterling. The wine list is also a hugely impressive tome which has to be one of the most comprehensive in Germany. The food was sublime. I ordered my regular; 600g bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed spinach and chips. Having only dined a week previously in London I had a decent barometer but this was even better. That is some compliment. As always, I didn't have space for a dessert. I'll be back in Hamburg and when I am, I will definitely be returning.",2015-10-15

We then went along and tasted the beans after being roasted, we then made a bar with a choice of approx 10 ingredients to sprinkle all over our bar from gummy bears to nuts, then we watched the machines that made the chocolates from the melting process to the wrapping of the bars.

There was a stone or something very hard, possible a bone piece, in one of the samosas (vegetarian). We told the server and he said sorry, but nothing beyond that. It was hard enough to shatter a tooth if bitten on aggressively. Next, the main dishes were very mediocre - not very tasty, but most of all the portion size was ridiculously small. I was astonished at how little was provided in each dish. There wasn't enough for even one person, and each dish was 14 Euro. Not to mention that one order of samosas only had one actual samosa in it. I've never seen that at any desi restaurant ever. After ordering those 3 dishes and paying 45 euro we were still hungry.

Most seats are hard and don't have backrests. Not cheap either (although, Germany take note, water ... is free and proactively offered.)- Drum roll -  my verdict on the Beyond Meat burger.The pessimist's take:This is, clearly, not beef. Too soft, and I can tell that this is not meat. If Beyond Meat is at version 1, wait for version 5.Mind you, I knew I was not having meat.So the optimist's take:I think that 95% of people would *not* have complained had they thought they'd be served a super-tender special-seasoning beef burger.

When we approached the bar we were offered two Guinness, almost as if that was the only option. I asked about the other beer available and then decided that it was either Kilkenny or Guinness. I went for Guinness. Next up, choosing some food. Near the front of the menu was Fish and Chips. I love a good fish and chips, but I've not had any since coming to live in Germany (1 year ago). I asked how it was, more meaning what type of fish and chips it was (chippy or restaurant), and was told that it's very good. I was then told that they were so confident in it that If you don't like it, you can have it for free. The Guinness was good. The fish was beautiful. As with all Irish pubs, the prices aren't cheap. A 400ml Guinness is EUR3.70 and the Fish and Chips was EUR10. I'll be back.",2008-11-13

They recently introduced a lunch menu! It's a bit sparse so I've only ordered the fish and chips during the two times that I've been in since this addition. It's a huge plate. Definitely the largest piece of fish I've ever gotten in a fish and chips meal and tons of fries.During the evening, they have a feta dip on their menu that is outta this world good. I always ask for no olives and they're happy to do so.On the weekends, they have a full Irish breakfast available for brunch. So yummy and kid friendly. They have a high chair! I've been bringing the wee one with me since he was about 5 mo old, both for brunch and for dinner.

Stone walls and exposed wood gives a great rustic feel to the place. Kilkenny, Guinness, and Bulmers are available, along with a fine selection of Irish whiskeys including a fantastic Tyrconnell 10 year Madeira cask and my personal favourite Green Spot, as well as some lovely German beers.There's a reasonably large patio out the front that over looks a square, and is great to sit in on a warm summer's evening. The staff are friendly, and super accommodating. Reasonably priced, and well located - this is definitely a bar to check out when in Hamburg.

In particular the Guinness was as good as it gets outside Dublin and the fish and chips comes with real chips (not frites, not french fries, CHIPS!!). The clientele was a mix of ex pat Brits and Irish and young Germans. Always a good sign. You would take a place like this for granted in Dublin or London.

The first night I went, I made the mistake of getting a BBQ burger. The BBQ sauce was less than pleasant and I welcome all Germans to swing over to the US sometime to try a taste of our BBQ, because you won't want to go back ;-). The fries I had were tasty and I appreciated that they offered mayo and ketchup in easy little plastic packs.

The bread used is that familiar super soft, highly processed looking bun that, frankly, isn't made to hold much in between them. This makes JB burgers a fork and knife kind of a meal. The burger patty looks mass-produced, was dry and highly seasoned, probably because of the lack of flavor in the actual meat. The fries tasted very much like McDonalds fries. Ketchup and mayo are 40 cents each and instead of serving the burger in a wrapper, it comes on a plate. I ordered the JB Champignon while my hubby ordered the JB BBQ.

I would have thought if she knew the problem, she would have given extra salad or addressed it somehow (I didn't want to pay for the rice and have it just go to waste), but she just left it. She never brought the hummus I had ordered, so I ended up getting up and going to the counter inside to ask for it. The grill plate also wasn't as described and was missing the stuffed meatball. The hummus was very good and the chicken was pretty solid, but everything else was just okay. The servers in the restaurant also came out for their smoke breaks and sat down on a stoop literally right behind my chair, which was pretty obnoxious. I wouldn't recommend this place.",2018-07-22

The menu isn't super descriptive and I don't speak German, but I was able to make out some of it from the online menu and photos.I got the regular size (one patty) JB Champignon, which came with mushrooms, cheese, and sautéed onions. I decided to make it a combo with their freshly made lemonade and garlic bread instead of fries, because I had never seen it as a side to a burger before (not thinking there would be an excessive amount of bread). I'm a big eater but the burger turned out to be larger and wider than I had expected, so I was glad I only got the one patty instead of two. These are the kind of burgers you might want to eat with a fork and knife! The burger also came with lettuce and, unexpectedly, this creamy, mayo-based type of sauce, which was good but got to be overwhelming and very heavy near the end. I ended up scraping some of the sauce off the bun and then later gave up on the bun to eat most the garlic bread instead.Like some other restaurants in Europe, my husband had to pay extra for ketchup, which was their own chain brand that came in a big packet. I also took a couple sips of his Fritz-kola, which is a soda brand made in Hamburg. My husband was also very stuffed with meal (I think he got a two-patty JB BBQ, but I can't remember).We were both really impressed with some of the people around us who were licking their plates clean. It seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck, though more expensive for us in general with the conversion rates from Canadian into Euros.

I think all of those are accurate.The menu is short (a good thing), with a choice of about four beef burgers, one chicken burger, and one veggie burger. There's also a beef tartare option if you're uncomfortable with any heat applied to your meat. I've always ordered the cheeseburger, and in my opinion it's good. They offer ""medium"" and ""well done"" for the beef burgers, and ""medium"" is consistently what I would call medium-rare in the US (which I'm happy about).You can't get a burger without fries, and their fries are pretty tasty. Lately the standard serving is a mixture of potato and sweet potato (I think this is new), but they're reliably good. You have to pay extra for any sauces/condiments, which is unfortunately too typical. The part that's even more dismaying is that the tiny cups of mayo are 1 Euro each. I mean, if you're going to charge me a Euro for mayonnaise, at least give me my money's worth.They also serve classic cocktails in the evening, along with beer and wine.

All our special requests were fulfilled, the chef created a state of the art vegan buffet (all the guests were NOT vegan and were shocked and happy and thrilled realizing how tasty and rich the food was), the tables were set the way we wanted with our artistic cards flowers and funky confetti and our balloons hovered around, making the room even more festive at the end of the event we all went outside and send the balloons to the sky.

Once we were seated it took a good 10-15 minutes before the waiter finally came over.I ordered the Thai Curry which was pretty good. For around 7€ I got the main dish plus a starter of my choice. I choose the spring rolls which were also tasty. Overall the food was pretty good, nothing to remember though. The service is what took this from a 5 star to a 4 star. There seemed to be only the 1 server and a lady who only cleaned the tables.I would probably come back though which is a good thing.",2012-04-20

It's a classy germanized asian food 2) This might sound like the loving hut chain you think you know from the US. It's not! None of the dishes are the same. Just the name and logo looks the same 3) the service is not about making you feel welcomed or comfortable. It's about making sure you get your food lol. Feels very chaotic and rushed. Would I come again. Nope. Do I regret coming here. Nope, it's good to know that loving hut doesn't equal loving hut.

The tables weren't clean and we had to wait for 25 minutes before anyone came to get our order, but so far so good, I can live with that for the sake of good food for such a price! Sadly, our entries arrived (one soup and spring rolls) and they were barely warm. Our main course also looked re-heated. It wasn't hot, the texture of my sauce was as if the gelatine used to thicken had been cooled down and then re-heated, which caused it to be way too thick and glumpy - not good. The menu advertised that I would get seitan, though it really looked like a can mock-duck to me. The fried rice was tasty still, they can have that. We got our drinks halfway through the main course.

I was actually on my way to somewhere else that had a good yelp review, when I saw Loving Hut and decided to stop here instead.Figuring out a vegan Vietnamese menu that is written in German when you only speak English is a bit of a challenge. Lots of words like ""tofu"", ""reis"" and ""soja"" were obvious enough. I felt pretty comfortable ordering with my limited understanding of the menu. I got number 29, which was spicy vegetables and tofu (aren't they all? I don't know). It was good. The proprietor spoke enough English to make it work.Prices are reasonable, but its cash only. They do not serve any alcohol at all. Service is pretty slow because there aren't too many people working the (just 2?). Still, I didn't find the wait bad. Just a little noticeable. If I had a bottle of white wine, I might not have noticed the wait at all. Hint hint.The joy of finding a place that serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan foods is diminished somewhat because the food is just so-so. It's not brilliant, but its not at all bad. I thought my order was a little light on tofu. Just 5 or 6 pieces. I asked fir it spicy, though, and i got what i asked for.

To the right is a boutique that sells Scandy candies, treats and miscellaneous gifts or decorations.  Once can stop in for a Fika which means coffee in Swedish or even have a nice meal.  They usually have Köttbullar, but since most dishes are made fresh in the back in a limited quantity, you have to check with the waitress to see what is on the menu that day. When I came in here, I ended up ordering some Tagliatelle with mushrooms and a truffle sauce which was very filling! I had wanted to of course try a more Swedish dish or even the classic Köttbullar (Swedish Meatballs) but to my dismay, they were fresh out of meatballs that day.Hamburg is actually heavily influenced by Scandinavian culture being so far north and in their history, the Danes and Swedes settled in areas around here such as Altona for example, particularly because the Hanseatic League had some battles over shipping merchant ships and even a history with Pirates.....and Vikings! I had to learn about this history when I did an Elbe/Altona tour :)Come here for breakfast, lunch or dinner they have cute names for their breakfast menu with Scandinavian themes like: the Oslo, the Stockholm, the Kopenhagen, and even you can order the Aarus.

Its interior uses elements from French brasseries and bistros including a full French loaf as starter. At the Brasserie guests can choose between leather booths facing the restaurant's inside and the Elbe River or tables next to the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river or the new Elbphilharmonic. The menu includes a German-French fusion cuisine and a comprehensive wine list (EUR 20 - 390 with an average bottle price of EUR 40). If listed I recommend to try the cold vichyssoise (actually the best I ever had) in combination with 'Carls Fass' a dry Riesling.Be cautious ordering their water flate rate, which isn't a real flat rate since every carafe is finally balanced on your check! The average costs per person, including drinks are about EUR 65 if you order a la carte or choose a prix fixed menu with wine.

The weather was hot and sun shining so the outdoor terrace was crowded. The service was slow because the staff was short due to several waiters being ill, so we got our drinks 15 minutes after we received our food. But they apologized and explained the situation. We didn't mind the tardiness. The food was also amazing and made up for it. It is also the only place I've seen that serves Nigerian Mountain tea. The day we were there they hade some musician playing on the square outside and Carls served drinks to the audience. Very nice atmosphere. Perfectly fitting for Hafencity. In the bistro they have a store where you can buy spices, tea and other things from their own brand Carls, wine from the related brand Louis C Jacob (Hotel and michelin-star restaurant C Jacob and Carls have the same owner), as well as lemonade, vineager, olive oil, cookies etc from various french brands. I LOVE the combination of bistro and store. And since the store is in the bistro it is open on Sundays which is a rarity in Hamburg.I bought Carls spices, Carls Elbe sea salt (profit goes to the elbe philharmonie foundation), avocado oil, Louis C Jacob's rosé wine (very nice btw) and Darjheeling tea. Oh and if you are there, either at the Carls bistro or the next door Carls brasserie, you HAVE to check out the ladies room. They look like they are from a old french movie from the 1920s, with upper half of the walls covered in in black and beige striped wallpapers, and the lower half in beige tiles, and the fllor in black and white tiles.

Not going to go into detail as many others have but service was top-notch from start to finish. Absolutely no complaints in this regard. Very professional and attentive. The food was also great. We had some oysters, a starter soup, the noodles with truffles and the Boeuf bourguignon. For dessert we shared the chocolate dessert with bananas and mango. Really enjoyed everything from start to finish. We skipped the flat-rate water for a normal bottle of still water. Not much more expensive to be honest unless you come thirsty. The wine was a bit off (Salvay Spätburgunder) but this was simply because of our taste. Wasn't bad but I was expecting something different....not the restaurants fault in any way. Finally, as others have mentioned, the toilets are really nicely done as well. I even snuck into the private room downstairs (with it's own bar...have to remember that for my next company event) to check out the IWC event going on....considering I'm a watch buff. Highly recommend Carls if you like Brasserie food. Don't be put off by the Hafencity surrounding. Only the philharmonie is to be completed.

I hadn't actually been to the top bar but spent an entire evening in the odd Inca-themed bar at the bottom, which reminded me of a bar I had visited in Disneyworld. Don't worry - even if you decide to party at the bar on the bottom floor, you'll end up having to go on up the spiral, since that's where the toilets are.

I had dinner on the night of a World Cup game so everyone was outside and all the restaurants were showing the game. It was really an event to see.The complimentary garlic dip at the beginning was okay, and a little bit on the saltier side, but when you're hungry and waiting on your food it doesn't necessarily matter. My boyfriend and I had the White Hauswein with our dinner. They brought our a bottle of it, and payment was calculated based on how much we actually drank, which I found to be liberating. I had the Paella Meeresfrüchte, which I definitely could've shared. The main problem with La Sepia is the wait and service. We waited for our food for over an hour and every time we asked about it, the server said he would go check on it and let us know, but he never came back. This happened about 3 times in one sitting.

Nothing major, you get that as a beer drinker, but, not very good quality sadly, and I thought that Sagres being a Portuguese beer (as far as I know) would have at least tasted good from a Portuguese restaurant.It's another one of those cases where they have a great location on ""the strip"" and they don't have to make an effort, and people still come and eat there.Look I agree the location is nice.  But seriously go to the Olympisches Feuer just to the right, the service, food, value is all a touch better and you'l still be on the strip.",2013-06-09

It doesn't look anything like the photo, cause you have to imagine the mass of people sprawled on the pavement. All good fun, and probably better than the Reeperbahn",2009-06-03

https://www.yelp.com/biz/gandhi-hamburg,4.0,"We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1:30. The restaurant was mostly empty except for one other table, but there are two small dining rooms, so it didn't feel too desolate.We ordered the lentil soup, the paneer pakoras, the mango curry with vegetarian meatballs, and the chicken biryani. The waiter was very patient with our German pronunciation of Hindu(?) words, and mostly ended up writing down the numbers of the dishes, so you can save yourself the trouble by just giving them the dish numbers.The food was quite good. We had some pappadams with a few tasty chutneys at the beginning (this is free/included). The lentil soup was really flavorful and had some fresh herbs on top that made it delicious. The mango curry was also quite good, with a very strong cardamom flavor (which my wife was into, but was a bit much for me), and served with a side of rice. The chicken biryani was a bit mixed for me. The chicken was boneless (I would have preferred the bones), but cooked to perfection. The rice included a tremendous amount of vegetables (zucchini, cauliflower, green beans, more than I've ever seen in a biryani), and was highly sauced, perhaps too much. It was a tremendous amount of food; easily twice as much as I could eat.The prices are higher than I would have expected (approx 5 euro for soup, 13 euro for curry, 15 euro for biryani), but it was a lot of food, and we ended up bringing some home.

This is mostly because they serve a handful of foods (Döner meat, falafel, veggies, various casseroles) in various formats (plates, wraps, sandwiches), and every single permutation is on the menu.The food itself is really good, and everything is prepared at the moment you order it, so you can customize as you like with sauces and other special requests.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/museum-f%C3%BCr-hamburgische-geschichte-hamburg-2,4.0,"I have been to Hamburg so many times that I thought I knew the city.Apparently, I can't be further away from being wrong. This museum - that is located on beautiful park with idyllic lake teaches you all about Hamburg and its history. It's located not far from U-bahn stop St. Pauli, so it can't get any easier than that, not to mention it's not far should you be interested to check out all the ""interesting"" entertainment on the infamous Reeperbahn.Again, dragged by my history and museum geek boyfriend, I came here by force (if not by free will) although I wasn't literally kicking and screaming. If it were up to me, I'd rather spend my time at Monckebergstrasse, but oh well - I guess a little history won't hurt.This museum has very interesting models of pretty much everything in Hamburg. At least you won't be bored by history by looking at interesting teeny weeny intricate models. It taught you what Hamburg really was back then when some Christian missionaries (and bishops) chose to settle here and named the town Hammaburg. It's almost like reading it on wikipedia, but with a lot of cute models. See? not boring.The layout of the museum was cool too and they had a room full of model ships just like in Copenhagen's Orlogsmuseet, and the most cool about this museum is that on the top floor, they have a working railway model of Hamburg in the scale of 1:32. That was amazing to watch. They did have people operating the trains and all. I felt like I went back to my childhood again.On the basement floor they had small exhibition of what Hamburg was like under Nazi reign, along with recreation of shops, places under World War II. Very interesting.All in all, a very interesting place to visit, especially if you're interested about history....and oh, did you know that Reeperbahn literally means the rope way? It's where back in the yore they made ropes for the ships. See? More knowledge of history here! I'm getting like 1% smarter than before... :P",2016-01-14

https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-da-enzo-hamburg,3.0,"I was hoping to see the (low) standard of service that we encountered in Bavaria get better as we dined in Hamburg but it was not so. Service here was definitely slow and not very attentive. Our waiter spoke fine English and that part of the meal went well, but engaging him to get our order placed was a bit challenging.Yes, they have a printed menu. It's in German. There's also a list of daily specials on the board, written in German that we could sort of read. Google Translate doesn't work well when you can't work out what the letters are. And then, there's another list of specials that the waiter has in his head, which is... interesting.I let him talk me into a mushroom salad starter which was unusual and quite delicious. A variety of grilled mushrooms, shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Enough for two to share.For main course, I chose the spaghetti vongole. Very good, a plate of pasta tossed in olive oil and garlic and then topped with cherry tomatoes, clams, shrimp and other seafood. Other than the pasta was perhaps a little underdone (or my taste for it is off?), it was delicious and I ate nearly the whole thing. Keto? Not today!My friend had the pappardelle with a beef and veal sauce. She said it was delicious but pointed out that there was no parmesan cheese to be had anywhere. And once she pointed that out, it was strange. Our waiter wasn't to be seen after the food was delivered so after waiting a bit, we decided to dig in. By the time we spotted him, there wasn't much point.So what could have been a five star meal dropped to just three because the pasta was underdone (in my opinion) and the lack of service which just left us underwhelmed.Note: There is Trattoria da Enzo and they have another Trattoria Due Da Enzo around the corner.[Review 12053 overall, 1836 of 2019.]",2019-10-16

It was nice and buzzy and fairly full with a mix of locals, tourists and business people.The waiter we had spoke German with such a strong, thick Italian accent that I couldn't understand him so we ended up speaking Italian instead! Once he knew I could speak Italian the whole experience became great; I told him more or less to choose for us then the food that came was really really fantastic.After respective starters of carpaccio and truffles & grilled squid in an octopus and black lentil salad my wife had rack of lamb and I had a Sea Bass with a salted crust. All with large glasses of red wine that we weren't told the name of but that it was 'buono' from the waiter!So it ended up being probably the nicest dinner I have had in Hamburg (maybe enven Germany so far) It wasn't cheap, at over EUR85 for two, however it would be hard to find nice food better cooked anywhere, plus the welcome, service and ambience made the difference between a good evening and great one.My wife and I agreed to go at least once a month, and I look forward to the next time.Enzo, Ci Vediamo!",2011-09-09

However there are some things that make the experience mediocre. For example, the dishes have unique ingredients or are prepared uniquely e.g. cactus enchiladas and chicken tamales. But, the Enchiladas are small and not ""loaded"" with cactus. Everything has too much cheese and the tamales are mostly corn meal, I could not seem to find the chicken in them. The Mojitos were too sweet. Generally Mojitos are made with soda water with dissolved sugar, not sprite with dissolved sugar. Overall food & drink quality 3 star. It took the waitress a while to come to our table (although we were one out of two groups at the restaurant). She also seemed to be more interested in cleaning the bar (which looked perfectly fine) than to serve the customers and avoided eye contact. Also, the food took a long time to come.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-haus-hamburg,2.0,"We tried seven different dim sum dishes but not only half of it was tasty and authentic. Some fried dumplings smelt already of (pork) fat when being served and didn't taste good either. Since we are regular in Hong Kong and Singapore, we know how it should taste. In addition, we were not amazed about the service either (actually fairly unfriendly, that's why I deduced another star).Nevertheless, we are 10.000km away from Hong Kong and authentic Chinese food is difficult to get: try the chicken feed at the Dim Sum house  they are really good and tasty!",2011-11-05
https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-haus-hamburg,1.0,The Dim sum was ok but the main dish Sweet and Sour was terrible . Cheap low quality chicken. The sauce was not made with love either and for 11.90 a real joke,2012-12-08
