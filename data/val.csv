3,"I wasn't expecting to eat Portuguese in Germany, but when in Hamburg... Delicious Aioli. Chorizo had a wonderful smoked paprika bent to it. The gambas in garlic and olive oil was exactly how it sounds with the garlic having nice roasted notes. The good news is that it all goes down well with a local draft, or a glass of red. The atmosphere was charming and felt like a hectic, but warm family restaurant."
4,"This museum was really amazing. It reminded me of the Natural History Museum in NYC, but without the barriers between you and the animals. You could get really close to the preserved animals and it made for a very interesting experience that really gave you a better sense of what the animals are like (you don't realize how big a grizzly is until you stand up next to it)."
4,"Das Piment ist ein sehr kleines nettes Restaurant in Eppendorf und wohl eines des besten Restaurants, in denen wir je gegessen haben.Es ist leider nie viel los im Piment, das mag aber auch an den Preisen liegen.Das Essen ist hervorragend genau wie der Service und wir waren nun schon einige Male hier und es gab nie auch nur die kleinste Beanstandung.Sehr nette Kreationen und fuer diejenigen, die gerne mal etwas Neues ausprobieren, ist das genau der richtige Ort. 5 Sterne fuer ein perfektes Restaurant"
3,"This is a pretty local place with good for for a very fair price. The small soup was pretty big and delicious. Everything was fresh. Only thing is that the meat seemed a hit dry, but overall great food."
2,"Right across from the Hauptbahnhof stands Nagel, one of the many German restaurants ín the city centre trying to attract tourists. It is nicely decorated, roomy and clean with interesting art-work on the walls. The menu choice is respectable as is the choice of drinks and the prices.My only complaint with this place is that I didn't find it very family friendly. It was made plain clear that my pram was in the way and it was even suggested to me that I should just leave it on the street - despite the fact it had a sleeping baby inside.This is still however a firm favourite for family and friends visiting from the UK"
3,"We came here for the 6-course house menu, which will keep you there for a very pleasant three hours.The food was good, rich, and portions sized to made sure you wouldn't leave hungry. All taken together, it was relatively heavy food without too many sides that I should probably not have eaten directly before heading home and going to bed... oh well...Loved some of their dishes - particularly the lamb chops - while others were just ok (e.g. the fried duck was overdone and not too refined). Overall, fair value for the price and a good experience if you want to sample some authentic Chinese cuisine while always staying on the 'safe side' for a Western palate."
0,"Wir waren heute abend dort! Nach einem Versuch von vor 2 Monaten, mal wieder griechisch essen zu gehen. Nachdem wir uns hingetzt hatten, wurden zwei Karten mit den Worten Auch was essen? auf den Tisch gelegt. Wir haben dann ewig gesessen und darauf gewartet, dass jemand die Bestellung entgegen nimmt. Vergebens! Nach 15 Minuten sind wir dann aufstanden und gegangen. In diese Kommerz - Tempel war ich das letzte Mal. Schließlich haben wir dann zwei Straßen weiter in der Behringstraße die Taverna Sotiris gefunden - Ein Traum!"
4,"This is a slightly ""hidden"" restaurant in the Hamburger Hof on the Jungfernstieg. It's my local coffee place as our offices are very nearby. Most people don't know this place by name but have probably walked by it often if they live (and shop) in Hamburg as it is quite central and everyone has walked through the Hamburger Hof at some point. They have very good coffee and the food is quite good. It's a fairly standard type of fare but is always good for a quick meal. I really don't order anything else except for breakfast type things in the morning or salads for lunch but these are favorites of mine. The service is also quite good and there is one waitress who's been there forever who is super nice. I can't remember her name though. The seating is also good because you can be inside, or outside/inside since the ""Hof"" is a ""Passage"" and you have variety in terms of people-watching. Further, they also have seating on both side of the Hamburger Hof completely outside which is nice in the summer months. Finally, it usually isn't overfilled so you can always find a place to sit."
4,Wonderful service! Worth the wait! Even the Caesar salad was great! Thanks for introducing me to some Hamburg Gins!
4,"My long ambition to get onto more submarines is finally coming to fruition. I've seen 2 in a month! My fascination with these relics of the cold war stems mainly from enjoying ""The Hunt for Red October"" so much. U-434 is a Soviet vessel dating from 1976. She is a Tango-class (NATO designation) attack boat, armed with 24 torpedoes. Powered by 3x 5200 shp 6 cylinder diesels, she was, I believe, the largest non-nuclear submarine in service at the time. A German businessman thought it would be a good idea to buy her for around EUR1M in 2002, and she was transported back from Russia for a further EUR1M and now lies in Hafen City. Admission is around EUR12 with an extra EUR3 for the guided tour, which ou can have in English. I highly recommend the extra tour as you get to see areas of the boat (command room etc.) that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. Sadly, as she was still in active service as a training boat until 5 years ago, the Ruskies removed quite a bit of equipment from her before she was sold. Therefore, you won't be plotting a firing solution as the torpedo computer has gone, along with sonar and communications. For the most part though this is as authentic as it gets. One ping only."
4,"Came here after a long walk around the city.  I sat outside on the picnic tables and ordered the seasonal special... a hamburger patty with white asparagus, potatoes and a big boat of hollandaise.  The best hollandaise I've ever had.  The meal was delicious.  Very friendly people that come here and the locals chatted me up even though I was a tourist.  Hamburg is great"
0,"They put the chairs upside down in our table while there were 15 min to closing. A good product will not sell if you don't know how to behave , sorry Jim Borrito"
3,"This restaurant is pretty good! I visited Ramen Bar Zipang on Saturday night at 6.30pm. There was already a queue but I was able to get a table within 20 minutes. I ordered a bowl of fried chicken and a chashu shoyu ramen. I enjoyed the fried chicken very much, however, although it was crispy and succulent, it was a tad too greasy for it be perfect. I also quite enjoyed the ramen. The ramen stock was thinner than what I was expecting but the portion sizes were great and the ramen was still tasty.At the end of the meal, my ramen cravings were satisfied."
0,We went there at 10:50pm yesterday to have a glass of wine. The waiter never cleaned the table nor did he ask us what we would like to have. The restaurant was about 70% full. This non-service is horrible. Never go there !
4,"We found La Trattoria on Yelp, and decided to drive over for a Saturday lunch outing. It was a rainy summer day, but the restaurant was open to the air, and an awning covered a few tables that were outside on the sidewalk.La Trattoria has a fairly standard bound Italian restaurant menu (antipasti, pastas, pizzas), then they have a chalkboard of what must be seasonal specials (or just recommendations) for lunch, and then there's a second chalkboard of daily specials. The waiter (who seemed like he must also be the manager) was friendly and got us a seat right away, tried a few jokes with our daughter, and was patient explaining the options.My wife had the cheese-filled ravioli with truffle cream sauce, which was excellent. There were seven or eight good-sized ravioli filled with some kind of firm-ish cheese, and covered in a very decadent truffle cream sauce. I ordered the daily special of chanterelles in a cream sauce over homemade papardelle; it was incredibly good. Lots of mushrooms, good portion size, and tons of flavor in every bite. Being six, our daughter ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce, and managed to eat about half of the giant ""kids"" portion (which she finished with gusto at home the next day).We also ordered tiramisu and tartufo for dessert. The tartufo was just okay, but the tiramisu was quite good. Overall, we loved our experience here, and will definitely be back."
4,"Wow is all I can say about this restaurant. The atmosphere was lively with an authentic Chinese feel. The food was absolutely fantastic, one of the best meals I've had in Hamburg. I cannot believe I've lived down the street for so long and not came here sooner. Be sure to call ahead because it was packed"
4,"Just wow... A must see and well really the only main attraction found in Hamburg. It might appear childish at first, but its far from, its a historical masterpiece. Whether you'd like to reminisce over your childhood modeling years, or your world wanderer this exhibition of tiny animated models will take you back. Outside of your personal experience, this would positively impact your child's imagination offering mechanical and historical significance. Prepare for a 3-4 hour visit, there is so much content I'd advise review it in detail. In any case you will miss something. Great for English speaking visitors, and German natives."
4,"I love, love, love Loving Hut! I come here for dinner at least once a month. Although the service can be a bit slow (this place gets packed and it's family run, so sometimes there's only one guy in front), the food can't be beat and it's well worth the wait. I've tried a lot of things on the menu and enjoyed them all, but I always come back to the summer rolls and the pho. Speaking of the soup, never will you have a better meatless pho, and even before I became a vegetarian I would've said this is the best in Hamburg regardless of animals protein content. So, whether you eat meat or not, this place is highly recommended!"
4,"Delicious! Great environment, friendly staff, and delicious ice cream- all for a great price!!! They also have vegan options. Would highly recommend!"
3,"Sundays around here don't have much too offer. Being first to wait had its merits though, because this place got packed fast.I had a L'envie with a cafe au lait. The crepe was ridiculously tasty. The cheese and ham tucked into the crepe with spinach and onion jam for toppings, then top it off with a dip into the egg yolk. Savory and delicious!The owner is French, but the staff regularly converse in German. English menus are a bit outdated in pricing at this point. Seating on two levels, bathrooms are on the second level too. Sadly if they catch on that you're from the US, they will push for an American sized tip."
3,"Strandperle is a beach bar, that quite unlike most beach bars in Hamburg is actually on the beach! Unfortunately the beach that it's on is the slightly crappy Elbstrand, but even so you can have a great time here. They do beer, wine, snacks and full meals. It's all a little bit overpriced, but hey, you're on a beach, so that's to be expected. I recommend coming in the late evening, watching the sun go down and then staying to watch the port at night. Last time I visited we actually got to watch the moon set too! (With a glass of Riesling)"
4,"The best coffee we had in Hamburg. Espresso as good as i Italy. Lots of people to look at, and excellent place to blend in and watch sct. Pauli meet schanzen..."
3,"Super cute place! Very American, love how they cater to vegetarians! But I will say that it would prob be in your best interest to get there around 8am or earlier or after 1pm. It's very small inside. Maybe less than 14 tables and I'm highballing it. Well worth the experience and very reasonably priced. Portions are large so if you are American like us please know you can not order multiple things like how we do at IHOP or Waffle House and eat off of those small plates. Literally you will be full off of one plate. Oh yea and I had THE best veggie burger I've ever had and I don't normally like veggie burgers but this was amazing."
4,"The ""transparent bakery"" (Gläserne Bäckerei) is a bakery located conveniently next to ""Planten und Blomen"" (plantenunblomen.hamburg.… ) and the Dammtor train station. It is run by Effenberger (effenberger-vollkornbaec… ) and offers a selection of freshly baked and often still warm delicious organic whole-grain bread. You can observe the whole process and have a chat with the baker in charge. A fun place, also for children."
4,"We hopped in here at 9AM on a Saturday when everything else in the surrounding area was closed until 10. Best decision ever, because the miniatures here on display are amazing! You have some very stereotypical US regions like New Mexico, Nevada, Hollywood, etc., but also some very faithful and amusing representations of Hamburg, other parts of Germany, and other regions of the world.The attention to detail is astounding. Each display has lots of little things to notice, such as a man photocopying his backside in an office building, or a man covered in toilet paper coming out of a port-a-potty. Even underwater or underground displays have little details and secrets to uncover. Even if you're not interested in miniatures (I certainly wasn't) it's still a marvel to behold, and very much worth the ticket price."
3,"Very tasty pizza, always a lot of ppl and friendly staff. One of our favorites in hamburg once it comes to eating pizza."
2,it was OK. not perfect and also not bad. Decent food for a normal/high pricevolume was not good. could be better. quality was OK. Juje and Kubide both were at normal quality.
3,Gemütlich freundliche Bedienung und außergewöhnliche leckere getränke zu guten preisen!
4,"This place is great. It's the only ""real"" bar in Hamburg where the bartendar probably knows more drinks than you. I used to tend bar so I am inclined to have a broad range in regards to drinks. The guys here blow me away with their knowledge. Great bartendars to ""chat"" with and talk alcohol. The vibe in the place is cool. Everyone is here because they know they are going to get the best drinks. Period! The fact that it's pretty classy in terms of the little details makes it that much better. I made the mistake last night of planning on going there after dinner for a drink with my girlfriend. Well, one drink became two and you know the rest of the story. Now I just need to figure out how best to get over there to go pick up my car. Tip: don't drive there for 1.) the obvious reason of thereafter not drinking and driving but, 2.) because there is no parking whatsover in the area.....it's all residential and you have to drive around quite a bit to find a ""legal"" spot for the car. In summary, if you're looking for ""hardcore"" bartending and really quality drink, this is your place. It's a bit off the beaten track but it's always ""on the way"" somehow. Do your best to visit!"
4,"I've already reviewed the London MASH restaurant so what more can I add here?Well, at the time of writing, this place was only a few weeks old in Hamburg. From my experience, these guys have really hit the ground running.The restaurant located in the smart and swanky harbour area of the city. From the outside and in, it looks and feels distinctly MASH. The glass front gives you views of the harbour but also opens up the restaurant and makes it feel quite spacious. The MASH bods have effectively split the space into two areas either side of the main doors and the cloakroom. The opulent bar is in keeping with the London offering - sleek, modern and stocked with a great range of spirits (especially whiskeys) and cocktails. The restaurant is is spacious and opens out into a second dining area at the back of the restaurant. So how does MASH Hamburg fare versus MASH London? I'd have to say, on this occasion I thought it was potentially better!! The service was faultless. As soon as they realised I was English, out popped the English menu and full service in English. The menu is identical but is actually even better value given that you pay the same in Euros as you do in Sterling. The wine list is also a hugely impressive tome which has to be one of the most comprehensive in Germany. The food was sublime. I ordered my regular; 600g bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed spinach and chips. Having only dined a week previously in London I had a decent barometer but this was even better. That is some compliment. As always, I didn't have space for a dessert. I'll be back in Hamburg and when I am, I will definitely be returning."
2,Sushi was alright. Staff wasn't directly rude but it felt uncomfortable. On top of that it is very busy and very very loud. Not suited for a relaxed dinner with friends.
3,"Burgerlich had me licking my fingers. Good thing I came in with clean hands.The burgers here are very juicy and flavorful. And with the accoutrement of the housemade sauce, sundried tomato relish, melting cheese, and a pretty generous helping of mayo, you can expect it to get a little bit messy. Being that the burgers come on a tasty and light brioche bun, by default, you know that a brioche bun can't soak up the entirety of this meaty-juicy mess, so it's gonna get on you. The bathroom is upstairs when you're ready to clean up.The ordering system is pretty fun and novel. They've installed pop-up screens at every seat within the restaurant. Choose your burger and customize via a touchscreen. I didn't get too fancy with my cheeseburger, I just added some bacon on it. Side note: the onion rings here are awesome and I don't normally order or care for onion rings. Another really good hamburger in Hamburg that I've experienced as a new Hamburger."
4,"Another cozy bar on schanze, where you can hang out any day of the week and drink some nice cocktails or whatever you prefer."
3,We've been there for the third time. Cute place for breakfast and coffee. Average friendly service. Unfortunatelly rather slow if its crowded which happens pretty much every weekend. The food is good and not too pricey. The decoration really catches the swedish atmosphere. We'll probably come back!
4,"Great Chinese food all round. As already mentioned by the other reviewers, the DimSum are excellent and the best in town. The Duck Rice is also very good. All in all I would say that this place wins it by a mile on the Chinese Food front. It's like many of the places in Asia, the decor is a little tacky, but the food is great. This place is essentially like a short trip to Asia and back!"
4,Just discovered this place tonight. Very good Pho soups and hot ginger tea. Staff very friendly. Prices also very reasonable. Great to have such a place in the Innenstadt.
3,Went there for dinner. Pretty good sushi. Probably one of the best places in town to get sushi. Nice atmosphere.
2,"Ciu bar has a lovely location next to the Alster, and it's nicely decorated and serves good drinks, but it's not my kind of bar. It's relatively expensive. It's a bit too shiny. All the customers there look like they earn much more than me and are happy to flaunt it. Yeah, it's just not my kind of place on first impressions. Maybe I'll give it a second chance sometime though."
1,Bad service even for Germany. Not the best food either. If you want beer and to be ignored go here. If you are actually hungry.... good luck. The sampler platter is not very appealing. Just skip to the entrees and save your self the money.
4,"After reading about this place in the New York Times' 36 Hours in Hamburg, I went to Hamburg just to see this place and I was not disappointed.We spent 3 hours(2.5 hours looking and 30 minutes in the cafeteria where they have several types of beer and free wifi)  there and still felt that we had missed things. The scope was amazing as was the detail.The only reservation that they had online was at 6:30 pm on the day we wanted to go (which was a holiday weekend in Germany). This was a great time to go as there were no lines and very few people.We ate in the cafeteria at 8:30 pm (they stop serving food at 9 pm) but they were still replenishing the food and it was pretty good (3 Radlers and 2 wurst and frites dinners for 17 Euros).They have a coat and baggage check. They also have charging lockers for digital camera batteries. You need a 1 Euro coin to start the charging, but you get it back when you retrieve your charged battery. They know that people take a lot of pictures here and they run down their batteries."
4,"Woohoo!!! Simply amazing...I decided to enjoy my dinner here with my parents, we had an amazing food experience!Everything is perfect! You start with a shrimps flambè, then two courses of fish/meat and dessert. Everything is so well presented and the cozy atmosphere let you enjoy a really good dinner!Reservation is suggested since the restaurant is quite small inside."
2,"The food here is simply excellent.HOWEVER, the service is arrogant and unfriendly to say the least. Be prepared to be treated dismissively and rudely."
4,"A range of great burgers and beers, and the service is very good; you'll be served quickly and, in my experience, food doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to arrive. Plus, if there's a Bundesliga or 2.Bundesliga game, they'll have it on all of their three TVs. Really cool place."
3,"Good Ol'e Jim Block. The ugly step child of Block House. Ok maybe not ugly but they're definitely related. Anyway, put that McDonalds burger down and head over to Jim Block because for about the same price you can have some real food! Everything is made right in front of you, it's fresh, it's fast, it's real, and most importantly, it's good.The only downside here, (at least at this location) is that there never seems to be enough seating. It is a rather small location which has very few seats. The lines are usually to the door if not out. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone who had their heart set on McDonalds or Burger King."
4,"I walked the streets for over an hour finding this place and working up my appetite. Upon entering, I saw a bustling, too busy for words or greetings staff doing what needed to be done to satisfy the already packed house.But then... appeared in the doorway between the bar and the first small dining room, a middle aged man with herring bone rimmed glasses and a chef's stature, looking like he belonged. Our eyes met and I moved slowly closer to him to question if they were still serving. (fear set in that it was after nine on a Saturday night with a packed house they would tell me they are out of food). The gentleman introduced himself as Sven, the owner and chef and pointed to a small table they obviously squeezed in for single diners like myself.A woman server quickly set the table, seated me and handed me tonight's menu. Hand written (by Sven himself) in German, I struggled to grasp just one dish to be recognizable. NOT! When the server returned, I asked her what alphabet this menu was written in? She said the chef writes the menu every night in his own handwriting, and she proceeded to read and translate in English the offerings of the night. All sounded incredibly creative and amazing, so my reply was, ""what is everyone raving about tonight?"" She suggested the Pepper Steak on a bed of Navy, Lima and Green beans. And the Swordfish Carpaccio. I asked her to wine pair the best of what was 'by the glass' and that she did. An Italian Rosé with the Carpaccio and a Portuguese Cabernet Sauvignon with the Steak.A whole lot more action and another glass of wine occurred and wow, oh wow what an amazing culinary and night on the town with Sven unfolded. I could go on and on here... it was my last night in Hamburg which is why I opted to dine in the best I could find. Well it turned out to be Sven's last night as he was 'moving on' (not retiring) but just done with this chapter of his life. Upon finishing my main course, Sven politely joined me at my table and told me his story of how he started the restaurant 33 year's ago. He pulled a delightful older man close to him and began kissing his bald head and telling me how much he loved this man. The man had been with the restaurant for 28 years as the kitchen coordinator/dishwasher/busboy and all 'round go-to man behind the scenes. It was obviously an emotional moment for both these guys.Sven gestured to the bartender to pour me another glass of wine (on the house) and continued his story about how the German government offers a €100,000 tax deduction if you've started a business and sell it at age 55. Sven proceeded to invite me out on the town with him for a few more drinks in the St. George district where he knew all the local pubs and lots and lots of people. He even walked me to the train station to make sure I got on the right train back to my hotel.Anyway... so much more to this story...Bottom line... I'm sure the quality of food coming out of this kitchen will sustain because the staff obviously loved Sven and were sad to see him go. The understudies in the kitchen are apparently who bought the restaurant and planned on changing nothing.I hope I run into Sven again someday... maybe in Portugal or the Azores!"
2,"I've never been to this style of restaurant before and found it rather amusing. Whilst the food wasnt exactly 5 star, there is plenty of it and the quality was good. I was in a group of 4 and we found the service to be quick, polite and attentive. Whilst the visit was on a Tuesday evening (not exactly prime time) the atmosphere was good. If you love ample portions and no frills dining I'd recommend this restaurant."
4,"Have always had a great experience here. The interiors are very cool and the cocktails are very good. Let's just say the drinks are complicated in a good way. Only problem sometimes, it can get super crowded."
3,If you are ever in Hamburg. Don't miss this place! The schnitzel was excellent as well as the potato pancakes Nice atmospheric. Truly enjoyed. C
3,"I went on an English Hamburg Dungeon tour with my friend and it was really fun! It was informative and easy to understand, though I will admit that more of the focus is on the effects and experience. My friend got a little creeped out, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't walk through your basic haunted house."
4,"I've walked past this place at lunch time, and there's always a line out the door. I finally tried it today, and wow!! Excellent tasting ice cream. Very very fresh. You should go here if you're in the area and looking for dessert!"
3,"I had lunch here today and immensely enjoyed it. The quality of the seafood is excellent and they cook it very well. My Pfannfisch (which I was told was a local Hamburg dish) with pan fried potatoes and a mustard sauce was excellent. Light fluffy and flaky fish with excellent potatoes and the sauce was also quite tasty (missing a bit of intensity for a mustard sauce). My oyster entree was also great and fresh. It was a bit expensive at €21 for 6 oysters but I had to try it as I have not had any oysters since arriving in Germany :-) I think I will keep looking for good oysters but it is not easy to find.This place is certainly not cheap and lunch for two with two courses and mineral water was around €80. I think you pay for the view here which many of the restaurants in the area do not have.I would come back here for the seafood but will explore loads of other places nearby also, that serve seafood (there is a line of seafood restaurants in this area so you have plenty of choice)."
4,"Unglaublich gute Sushi, sogar das vegetarische Sushi mit den 3-4 Stücken tempura-Gemüse finde ich zum niederknien (in anderen Restaurants sind das oft nur Gurkenmaki, die man am liebsten vergessen möchte) Vorweg gab es eine ganz schlicht aussehende gemüsebrühe mit lachsstückchen. Selbst die war ein Gedicht. Mein neuer lieblingsasiate."
4,Fantastic experience and customer service. We accidentaly bought tickets for the wrong day and they let us join the tour anyway. The chocolate is amazing and we had so so so much fun!
4,"This Miniatur-Wunderland is the biggest model museum in the world (in the Guinness Book of Records). They have various model constructions from Germany to USA.  There is so many houses, automobiles etc that make up the areas with most of the model villages/areas with moving elements from people to automobiles. Throughout time at the museum the lights will dim to give you a glance of how the model village looks like at night as well as during the day.  The night scenes are as spectacular as of the lights that come on in the houses, etc.  I highly recommend to anyone and don't forget to press the buttons to make some of the moving elements move.  Highly recommend to anyone that loves trains and models that move and light up."
3,"Great Coffee, Muffins and Soup! I have not tried their other offerings, but this small cafe is full every day at lunch and throughout the day with people picking up coffee to go. Wonderful location right at the Hallerstrasse U1 entrance, Make sure to get a frequent buyer card!"
4,"I always thought that burgers are something you get at McDonald's or Hesburger, but that changed when I came to Hamburg. Oma's Apotheke was the place i've tried my first real burger and I still can't find a place to top that. The staff is very welcome, interior is good, the food is great! What else do you need? :)"
1,"Kofookoo is very spacious and nicely decorated. I liked the high ceiling and the interesting light fixtures. The menu is all you can eat or you can order al a carte. Just so we can try more dishes, we went for the all you can eat. We came at lunch on a weekend so it was 15.90 per person--honestly rather steep for the quality of food. I had a hankering for sushi so we ordered most of the sushi, especially those with the raw fish. The only decent thing was the sake (salmon). The octopus and squid were super chewy and had no flavor. The tuna maki was a little concerning because the rice around the fish had turned pink. That shouldn't happen unless the fish was dyed, or something. Also all the maki tasted like they was pre-made and left out for awhile. We tried the warm dishes and the tofu was the most tasty so we ordered a second one, but it was cut too thick so the center was not warm at all. The best part about the food was the black sesame ice cream; we ordered two portions and ate it with the fried kokos creme and fried banana. We got the fruit salad and it was melon that had obviously been cut and sitting there for some time.The staff was nice and friendly and the service was good and quick. However, I wouldn't come back."
4,"Have been to this place a handful of times now and the experience never gets old. It's one of those you have to be appreciative of where you are type deal. Literally if you blink you will miss this place bc it's so small but the intimacy will never fade. Hands down some of THE best drinks I've had my entire stay in Germany. Service is impeccable and they also have a coat check. Hope that smoking is not an issue because they smoke indoors with the windows closed. This place is great to let your hair down without having to do the club two step of prepping, dressing up, meeting a guy/girl. You can just come here in regular clothes, grab a drink and make a new friend since you will more than likely be bumping into people even though you may not have been planning to."
4,"We went to Meine Kleinraumdisko the other day after a hard night's drinking gluhwein at the DOM. A few friends were over from the UK, and one had brought a bottle of ""Pendle Witch's Brew"" as a present (see photos). Unfortunately being completely drunken the beer was lost during the course of the night... that was 5 days ago. On the off-chance that it was still there and had been saved from consumption, we turned up there last night. Amazingly they had found it and kept it! (see photos) The place itself is a cool little bar that I always think of as being on feldstrasse, but is actually on the bit that is called Neuer Kamp. Very confusing. The decor is 70s-styled wallpaper and disco lights. The music is chilled and there are loads of sofas to lounge about on. As far as I'm concerned the beer is Augustina."
0,"A place that calls it self CHICAGO MEATPACKER and just offers 3 american beers (and 3 standard beers at that) seems like a rip off wrapped up in an US theme to me.Haven't had food there, because the beer experience was enough already."
4,"We ordered chili cheese fries for appetizer off the board. I had The Jack, it was delicious. The meat was cooked at perfect temperature and they put a pretty good amount of cheese. I was afraid the blue cheese would be too strong but it wasn't. I added an egg on my burger for the hell of it. The bread they use are English muffin which is a nice change."
3,"I actually got lost looking for this place. I'm a damn tourist that doesn't know how to read street signs, let alone have a sense of direction whatsoever. A bartender recommended Oma's but we misunderstood what he said so we walked around in circles until we found it. The place was packed even on a weeknight so we knew it was good.The food is surprisingly good and cheap too. I ordered the schnitzel with bacon. Everything is good with bacon! It came with potatoes and lots of bacon. It was quality food for under €10. You should come here with a big appetite because the Germans are known for serving huge portions."
4,This is definitely a must-see when you're visiting Hamburg. Or when you live here.
3,"We went here on a busy hot sunny day last week. We would have walked right past it, but my 8 year old daughter saw it and was capitivated. So we paid for a family ticket expecting to just walk up and down the deck, go to the loo then get off. How wrong! The ship is brimming with interesting things about itself, the original merchants who commissioned her, how the crew lived, lots of artefacts plus all the lower decks and cabins left how they would have been in days gone by. There is also a nice looking restaurant deep in the heart of the ship. We really enjoyed our 90 minutes on there and regard it as one of the highlights of my family's week in Hamburg"
4,"I've eaten at the bistro twice. Last time was last sunday which was a very busy day. The weather was hot and sun shining so the outdoor terrace was crowded. The service was slow because the staff was short due to several waiters being ill, so we got our drinks 15 minutes after we received our food. But they apologized and explained the situation. We didn't mind the tardiness. The food was also amazing and made up for it. It is also the only place I've seen that serves Nigerian Mountain tea. The day we were there they hade some musician playing on the square outside and Carls served drinks to the audience. Very nice atmosphere. Perfectly fitting for Hafencity. In the bistro they have a store where you can buy spices, tea and other things from their own brand Carls, wine from the related brand Louis C Jacob (Hotel and michelin-star restaurant C Jacob and Carls have the same owner), as well as lemonade, vineager, olive oil, cookies etc from various french brands. I LOVE the combination of bistro and store. And since the store is in the bistro it is open on Sundays which is a rarity in Hamburg.I bought Carls spices, Carls Elbe sea salt (profit goes to the elbe philharmonie foundation), avocado oil, Louis C Jacob's rosé wine (very nice btw) and Darjheeling tea. Oh and if you are there, either at the Carls bistro or the next door Carls brasserie, you HAVE to check out the ladies room. They look like they are from a old french movie from the 1920s, with upper half of the walls covered in in black and beige striped wallpapers, and the lower half in beige tiles, and the fllor in black and white tiles. And cool square shaped toilet seats to match. They also have a nice dressing room outside the toilets. Next time I'm in Hamburg I will visit the brasserie."
4,"The Rathaus is their city hall, but you wouldn't think so with how grand and big it is!  The architecture is truly breathtaking.  I was surprised to see that it was open on a Sunday.  My boss and I went in before closing to look around and just awe.  Apparently you can take a tour, but we didn't know this and opted for a quick ""free"" self-tour.  Loved the back area as well.It's in the heart of the city center and is worth a visit!"
4,"We got there pretty late, probably 30min before closed. Still a lot of people there. It is really popular. I had shrimp pho, and my friend had no 7. Both are pretty good. Wanna try the drinks next time. 很好吃，并不是特别地道但是融合的很不错，下次还会再来。想尝尝喝的，看到别的桌喝的，看起来很好喝"
2,"Had dinner here a few nights ago. Aubergine auflauf was really good, so was the service, but it's a bit crammed and the bare walls make it pretty loud.I don't think you'd be disappointed coming here, but considering it's in a region with a lot of good places I'd look around for another option."
4,Excellent cakes and hot chocolate/coffee. Really chilled and a great place to pit stop whilst exploring Hamburg. Highly recommend!
2,"We found Al Volo on Yelp a few months back, while we were looking at an apartment nearby. It was cold outside, we were tired and hungry, and Al Volo's clean, warm, and well-lighted interior was extremely welcoming.On my first trip, I ordered the pizza affumicata (smoked ham and smoked mozzarella), which was really excellent. My wife is partial to the pizza piemonte (with black truffle cheese), and my daughter loves their kids' pizzas. The pizzas are tasty and come out of the kitchen quickly.On our second trip, I made the mistake of venturing beyond the pizza menu, which turned out to be a mistake. I love me some spaghetti carbonara, so I gave it a try. It was heavy, with overcooked noodles and a too-heavy sauce that stiffened after a few minutes. There was ample pancetta, but that couldn't help the situation.The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The dining room is casual and comfortable. Just stick to the pizza and you'll be fine."
3,"Scandinavian style, with wooden tables. They also have toys and books to keep the kids entertained. The menu is in german but the waitress kindly translated it for us. They have tasty dishes for an healthy lunch."
4,Fantastic food and atmosphere. Leave enough time to get through all the yummy dishes. Probably a good idea to make a reservation!
3,Excellent cheap Indian food as evidenced by how crazy busy they were this Wednesday night. Got the veggie thali and okra curry for 6euros each. Very busy around 7:15 on a weekday- ended up waiting more than 30 mins for our food. (Thus minus one star). Otherwise very flavorful and the mango lassi was perfect on a summer day.
4,"Golden is certainly one of my top favourite chinese restaurants in Europe. Instead of choosing from the German menu, I recommend to talk to the owner-manager, a smiling chubby 50 year-old chinese who speaks English and is very friendly and helpful. If there's too many people to get a hold of him, choose dishes on the menu starting from number 700 and above. Those are the authentic ones. All previous ones are for foreigners. I beg you not to drink soft drinks with this food, order jasmin tea for heaven's sake! They actually serve an excellent one, a rare thing these days and a distinct sign of quality."
2,"Though the burgers are a bit expensive, they are a joy to bite into when you are craving a burger similar to something you would find in the US.  Their burger sauce is pretty good, and everything is fresh and made to order.  Another downside to it being a bit expensive, is your not full after one burger."
4,"An intimate wine bar with a lovely menuA short convenient walk from an M2 bus stop, I had a very pleasant evening in this wine bar which seems to have a very dedicated local clientele.  I had a salad and soup--both were extremely tasty and the recommended wine to accompany was superb.  The staff was friendly and kind and welcoming to an American on a business trip."
0,"Is it even possible to provide slower service? I would't recommend stopping by there but there is not many places in the area for a coffee, so..."
4,"This place rocks! A great beach bar with a great Hamburg vibe. It's more off the beaten track than the inner-city beach clubs, and the vibe here is chilled and ""real"". Try the matjes-brötchen (matjes herring rolls), they're lovely, and I get told by Hamburg colleagues they are some of the best in town. A real bonus is that you get the nice evening sun here."
4,"After having eaten at Thai Cowboys in the Sternschanze area of Hamburg, I decided to try out this one and see if it was up to the same high standard. The staff were friendly, and when they could see that I couldn't find what I wanted on the menu board, I was asked what I was looking for. When I told them I wanted something with squid, I was told that they didn't do anything with squid, but if I really wanted it, they would be happy to fulfil my wish. The result was absolutely delicious, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending you try this. It's an ""imbiss"" rather than a restaurant, so don't be expecting silver service. If all you want is top-notch Thai at a ""gunstig"" price, then you've found the place."
4,"Think of Mc Donalds or Burger King and then think better quality. JB's is a fantastic burger bar in Barmbek. It's a bit of a walk from U S Barmbek and situated underneath Block House.JB's and Block House are tied together business wise or were. Someone told me about that but I forget the full story.The burgers are a big sized and packed full of tasty stuff ranging from fried mushrooms, bacon, cheese. All with a good dash of salad. Plus frieds or garlic bread on the side.Insider tip: Try the garlic bread!! It's the same as Block House. So incredibly tasty!The restaurant is nicely sized with kids area. It's also well kept and maintained. Staff service is also pretty good. But expect a queue around 6pm when everyone decides they can't be bothered to cook."
3,Best lunch place in the area. The Pizza is delicious and the price is unbeatable... For just 4€ you get the classics like Salami etc.At night time the place is usually packed and you have to expect some waiting time. Even with a reservation which gets you wondering why they bother to take them in the first place. With the check comes a complementary bottle (!) of Sambuca... which not too bad (except for the morning afterwards).The focus on the menu really are the pizzas. Just once tried some pasta and it was average at best. So don't even think about anything else.
4,The best six euros you'll spend on Indian food! The mango lassi is delicious and I highly recommend the matter paneer and the butter chicken. Not great for big groups though.
4,"A cosy place, next to u2 Hauptbahnhof. From ordering to getting food is just in a short while. Totally in  with their chicken avocado bowl. Absolutely recommend this place for everyday healthy lunch"
4,"Bester Burger Hamburgs! Leckere Brötchen, sehr gutes Fleisch! Wer medium bestellt, bekommt auch medium! Die Süßkartoffel-Pommes sind auch top und vor allem wird eine recht große Portion serviert.  Die Location hat echt Charme, individuell und modern eingerichet ohne steril oder snobby zu wirken. Die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich. Reservierungen sind nicht möglich, wir haben aber kaum 10min gewartet.  Burger essen in Hamburg? Dann zu Otto!"
4,"This was the most amazing food I tasted in months! The hejpapa-crew didn't pay me for saying this  they just surprised me with quality food, best coffee (as good as kopiba coffee) and very good service. People, you should come here.Last not least, they have free WLAN."
3,"Dubara is apparently ""the best kebab shop in Hamburg"". This is more of a folk-lore thing amongst my friends then an official claim, but of course, I had to test this theory out. OK - I have to be honest here, due to the baffling popularity of doner in continental europe, you're never going to get quite a good a kebab in France/Germany/Holland etc. as you will down the curry mile in Caspian's, Manchester (check out the reviews!!), but this place isn't bad at all. They do a special with coated nan with some sort of pizza sauce, all wrapped cylindrically, so you can eat it length-ways. This is important as any kebab-lover can attest. This monster will set you back EUR 3.70, although there are cheaper options, including a kebab with chips actually in it. I must try this. They also sell beer as everywhere here, and the staff are funny, so give it a go."
4,"Yes, I love this place, even though I thought I ordered meat on my pizza, but ended up with peppers instead. Oh well, I guess something got lost in translation. (my own bad). You can choose from various ingredients and combine your own pizza. Superb! Pizza tasted good, nice crunch to it and the pizza sauce was a nice surprise! Price was ok as well. Its just a little walk from Reeperbahn, so not far from public transport. Would love to have a place like this as my neighbour. Free wifi as well."
4,"I'm the fans of this restaurant as I was living around the corner of the it. I haven't been here for a long time after I moved out this district. I was here again for their Tuesday 3 courses Menu which costs €19,90. You can pick up either fish or meat on the main course. I was very very happy and satisfied as their cooking was no change at all, still keeping their high standard. I'm sure I will come again and it's highly recommended."
1,"A bland and overpriced chicken curry. A waste of time, money and my appetite. By Hamburg's standards it's not that bad  but it is a very low standard. Must do better Chutney and Hamburg generally."
3,"Had steak menus here, twice, yummy! Nice service and a great atmosphere!"
3,"The place is quite small but beautifully situated and it is serving good fish dishes. The service is very helpful and nice. The owner is a nice and chatty guy. Unfortunately there's no toilet and one must use one in ice cream spot next to it, which is kinda awkward. One must also know that there are few places to sit. Nevertheless place worth visiting."
4,A great place for fish and seafood. Always something good on the menu with regular specials. Reasonably priced and friendly staff too.
2,"This is one of my favorite cafes around the area where I live. Coffee is decent (I generally have the soja cappucino) but their food is the real deal. Great to have a small bite or for brunching during rainy days. I recommend their soups and their vegetarian quiche. Additionally they have free wifi, making it a great alternative to Starbucks if you need a place to read or work. If you are in the area, check it out!Mucho love,D."
2,"The grilled fish and meat is really good and would warrant the fourth star. Unfortunately sides are a little bland, and sauces clearly contain ready-made convenience ingredients. Atmosphere is ok, and they keep distributing glasses of Raki..."
2,"The new Jim Block is really shiny looking, probably due to it's position next to the Alster where everything seems shiny and expensive. Thankfully the burgers are the same price as everywhere else. I should mention for those unfamiliar with the Jim Block franchise that they're a sort of classier fast-food burger joint. You get a real plate and cutlery and you can choose a beer as part of the meal-deal. The burgers are better than standard fast food burgers, and the fries are pretty decent too. If you want a quick burger I'd recommend this place. However, in the context of Jim Block restaurants, this one is super-busy. They don't seem to have any more staff though, and do the service really suffers. Last night there were 5 staff and only 2 people ahead of me in the line, but it still took me 10 minutes to get served. I shudder to think how long it'd take with a line out of the door (I have seen this)."
4,Love this place! Great burgers. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Asahi and saké with a Waygu Chesseburger and kimchi is hard to beat!
2,"Nice and warm and filled with manily uni students this is a great little place for lunch as it's near the Uni, cheap, fast and effective. Their soup and bread is yummy, filling and a bargin. There's plenty of other things on the menu if soup isn't your thing, pizza, bagels, pasta etc... the coffee is drinkable too."
3,"This place blows the Miniature World in Victoria, BC.  Respect to the people who created this place.  I noticed the awesome replicas of Las Vegas, New York, and Hamburg.  The model of the Hamburg Airport was pretty cool with planes departing and landing with day and night scenes.  A must stop for anyone visiting Hamburg."
3,"We went there for early dinner on our last night in Germany. The place was packed though the food came out at reasonable time. We ordered medium spicy chicken wings for starter. It was good but very spicy for us so we suggest if you want mild, choose the bbq variety instead. For the main course we had hickory bbq burgers served with fries on the side. The buns were brioche so it's softer than the usual burer buns. For dessert, we had hot fudge sundae which is my favorite. It taste better than it looks! My bf had a beer while I got a .75l of water. Our bill came at around €60. It costs more than our usual budget but we enjoyed the food anyway and it's our last day in our Germany vacation. It is not a quiet restaraunt. And don't expect so much if you want to be seated by the window with a nice view. I am not sure if they accept table booking because the feature on the website was not working when we tried."
4,"A great little cosy cafe auf dem Kiez to hang out on Saturday or Sunday afternoons in St. Pauli. Located in between the Reeperbahn and Millentorn-Stadion, in whats slowly becoming one of my favorite parts of town, this cafe is off the beaten path enough that there are few tourists and mostly locals hanging out in a relaxed atmosphere. Staff is friendly and after a while you feel like a regular. Prices at Mimosa are very fair, you can easily get a drink and a piece of cake for less than 5 Euros. When you consider that all the cakes are made and baked in the back (it smells quite good on days they are making jam), this is a steal- and they are delicious to boot (Im a fan of the chocolate-poppy-cherry cake). The sandwiches are also great and are a good option for a light lunch."
2,"Fun, airy, Moderate.  Told myself I didn't go to Germany to eat Italian, much less at a chain, but after several days of never seen anything remotely green on my plate (ubiquitous potato, one restaurant served me two side dishes of potatoes prepared differently), i needed the vegetables.  DH got roasted vegetables on his pizza, I decided on a spinach pesto pizza.  Slices of heaven.  Salty, though.  Did you know heaven was high in sodium?  Drank a gallon of water, but water is good for you.You go station to station.  Pay at the end, it's added to this card you are given upon entering.Very brightly lit.  Communal tables, but no one talks to each other.  Often crowded.  Potted basil and rosemary plants on the tables."
4,"Amazing food in a warm, somewhat stuffy basement filled with Chinese people even on Tuesday night (always a good sign).Very good Dim Sum, Kai Lan with garlic, even the small spring rolls were perfect  super crispy and fresh. This is REAL Chinese.I have had a lot of Chinese food over the years but this was certainly one of the best and I will certainly go here again on my next visit to Hamburg :)"
3,Really good food. Service was slow but other wise OK. The biggest downside was the lack of English menu.
4,"Das Restaurant is einfach genial! Sehr schön, wirklich leckeres Essen mit einer super Präsentation, und vor allem echt nette Bedinung!! Wir waren zur viert, zwie hatten nur ein Hauptgericht bestellt und die zwei andere Hauptgericht+Vorspeisen. Die Kellner sind einfach mit zwei extra Mini-Vorspeisen angekommen, damit die zwei mit Vorspeisen nicht allein essen. Das war einfach Klasse. Die Preise sind ein bisschen höher als normal. Wobei ist es nicht übertrieben für die Qualität vom Essen und vom Service! (ca. 18-25eur für ein Hauptgericht). Dieses Lokal ist wirklich zu emfehlen!"
2,"This is OK Thai food for people who are not overly fussy about Thai food.I usually have pretty specific ideas about what the food I order is supposed to taste like. Nothing we ordered here tasted the way I thought it should have, but it was nice enough all the same.My husband ordered the cashew chicken which was generously portioned with nuts, veggies and meat in a flavorful sauce.I ordered a Tom Kha Gai which was a bit bland, but I soon fixed that up with some chilis in fish sauce (what they bring you in lieu of hot sauce). Was pleased. But then came my fried noodles which, in all fairness, more or less the exact same thing one gets at whatever Hamburg's equivalent of China Box is. Sure, it had bok choy and lots of meat in it, but it was absolutely flavorless and uninspired.We couldn't find anything resembling Phad Thai on the menu; maybe it was there and we missed it, but I was pretty disappointed about that. None of the awesome rice noodle dishes, no Pad See-Ew either.For the price, I thought we could have done much better at the dim sum up the street or even at the China Wok imbiss at the train station.The service was competent and the food was not bad, but we work hard for the little money we have and will spend it elsewhere in the future. Nothing wrong with paying a decent price for good food but that was not really what we found herejust mediocre versions of potentially amazing dishes for people without a lot of experience with Thai cuisine."
3,The first time I went to Germany I stumbled on the Schanze by accident. The next time the intent was to hit the Schanze and I ended up at here.  You can start off with drinks upstairs as the bartenders do a great job working their way around the bar.  After drinks and lounging upstairs it's then time to go downstairs after I think 11pm.  Be prepared that it is pretty hot down there if you have on multiple layers as I did.  No matter nothing more drinks can't fix and an escape to the bathroom to peel off a couple of layers.  The music was a great mix of old and new. Great !!
4,"Cracking little Mexican cafe/bar serving real mexican food, the likes of which, I had never tasted! It's a lot like mud, basically, but made from chocolate, and call Mole. Maybe it's made from moles? Of course, the real attraction here is the extensive range of tequila, some of which didn't even make us projectile vomit across the table! Actually I suspect there may have been a little chundering but hell, it's all good."
4,"Loved this place! Definitely the best Indian food we've found in Hamburg. I think you can't go wrong with ordering any dish here. Loved the naan and chicken curry. Definitely not a pretty restaurant and service here is not anything to write home about, so the food here is the star!I wish Germany had more of these types of restaurant options, where you order at the counter and pick up your food when it's ready. Easy, quick and cheap! Love it!"
0,"Sub-par food at high prices, snobby owners more interested in joking around than dealing with the customers queuing. To me, this is another one of the many operations riding the vegan trend for maximum cash and giving the vegan movement a bad rep."
4,"My new favourite café and a highlight of my Hamburg visit.  Quaint and full of character,  good vibes and chill tunes - this café serves up some amazing homemade cheesecake (highly recommend!). The homemade ice-cream is also bomb! Staff are friendly and informative."
4,"I went to Oma's Apotheke (which is not a chemist!) for the first time last night. I was really pleasantly surprised. I've always previously crossed the road to Franck und Frei, but I have to say, the steak in here is even better. Lashings of absolutely delicious creamy pepper sauce, with great thin cut fried potatoes instead of fries (you can have either), and quick service considering how busy it was. My friend had the salad which was also huge, and neither of us finished despite going in hungry. Definitely worth a look."
3,So a place called Mr. Kebab is not exactly what you would think of as great for a pesqutarian. This though was one of my favorite meals in Hamburg. There were a whole bunch of vegetarian options and the one I got was absolutely delicious. My mouth waters thinking of this restaurant. Great place to visit!
4,"I got the best calamaris (baby calamari) here, I love them so much I eat only this food here. So amazing and even my friends tried them and told so. The other food I have tasted from others was also nice but the calamari.... Can´t wait to come again."
4,"Excellent vibe and great selection of craft biers! Visited on a mid-Saturday afternoon. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and knew their biers. The pulled pork sandwich was also huge and probably one of the largest sandwiches I've ever had. I'll definitely return!"
4,I simply love it! The best pizza in town! Friendly service and great prices! My favorite party-italian:-)
3,"Came here early yesterday night between two apartment visits. The restaurant was approximately empty with only a single table occupied. It took about 3 minutes for the hostess to seat us which felt like an eternity. How many reservations can you possibly have on a Monday night to not be able to seat 2 people at 6 pm??Afterwards, the service quirks continued. For the first time since we arrived in Germany (~2 weeks), we dared to do the unthinkable: Order 2 glasses of tap water. We were not disappointed. At first the waitress made me repeat what I said, although I'm pretty sure that she perfectly understood the first time. Then she wrinkled her nose and went away. A little while later, the other waitress came back with 2 glasses of water on a tray and asked us: ""Is this what you ordered? Really?"" Haha, what a laugh! It is well known that German restaurants do not like to serve tap water and that they would rather sell you bottled water, however I was not expecting such an intense reaction. Anyway I thought it was quite funny and I can't wait to try this again in other restaurants.I had the grilled octopus which was amazing and my wife had the lamb souvlaki which she said was the best lamb she's ever had. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service: 4 stars overall. We'll be back if we're in the area, and we'll order tap water again."
4,Reviews about the hamburgers are accurate.  The burgers were well cooked and filling.  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly.  Television in the back corner was convenient but did not overpower or consume the room.
3,Love this place. Love the wall paper. Love the free mini Lucky Strike matches. Love the music. Came here once a bit too early I think about 11pm (although that's quite late for an English person!) and it was really quiet and my boyfriend fell asleep But when this place is packed it's definitely one of the best places in the city to go.
4,"This is a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant! As we walked in we were already so glad to be there. The interior design is so pleasing - both calm and hip. It would be a great place to bring a big group to. Clean lines mostly white, accented with dark wood tables and yellow cushioned benches gave it an snappy touch. There are only about 10 main dishes on the menu which is in my opinion a good sign. Everything tastes fresh. My friend and I ordered two different things and shared. The veggies were crisp and the meat perfectly prepared - the beef was tender and the chicken and pork were crisply grilled. I thought the offer was cleverly assembled, offering a variety in just one dish. For example: the grilled combination of pork, shrimp and egg roll on vermiccelli. It is located about 10 min. walking distance from Central Station or directly at U-Lohmuehlenstrasse. The price per plate is around 6-8 Euros. I suggest trying the Vietnamese beer, Saigon, made from rice. It was really good - kind of like Sake. They offer cocktails as well and of course tea."
2,"The Neustädter Grill Meier is a no frills German fast food joint in the Wexstrasse, frequently visited by office workers in the area. It has all the usual menu items you will find at any other German Imbiss like Bratwurst (grilled sausage), Currywurst (sausage in a sweet, curry-spiced ketchupy sauce), Schnitzel, fries, Halbes Hähnchen (1/2 roasted chicken), potato salad but also other meals such as goulash with mashed potatoes. I mostly opt for the large Currywurst with Fries. Even though the sausage is not grilled (since this place doesn't have grill, everything is deep fried) it's good and the sauce (not self-made) also does it's work. Fries come in a well-sized portion and are hot and crisp. Those of you who want a no frills German Imbiss with acceptable prices should spend their lunch here. Unfortunately this place is closed on weekends, so I have to find another joint to satisfy my rare Imbiss cravings"
4,When did you last sit on a stove while conversing with someone on a washing machine? Exactly.
3,"Riad's is a nice little restaurant. It's a little bit dark in here if you don't get a seat in the front room, but pretty comfortable nevertheless. I had a delicious Falafel plate for 5,50EUR from the lunch menu card. For 7,50EUR you can also get a lunch menu consisting of any main course, three starters and a desert. This is what I'm going to try next time, since I still was a little hungry after having had my Falafel plate."
4,"Absolutely worth a visit! Booking your tickets ahead  of time is highly recommended. Alternatively, you can try going on a weekday and being there very early. It worked for us - we only stood in line for about half an hour and got to see most of the exhibition before it got super crowded. There is also a cafeteria where you can get snacks, drinks or meals before starting your tour.The gift shop offers a variety of souvenirs and model trains. They also have their very own newspaper which looks super cute and realistic. Don't forget to take your free copy at the entrance!"
4,"Classic Greek! No major decorations, no shi-shi people, just quality food and heartfelt service. It's not often you go into a restaurant where a bunch of people hug the owner before leaving. I am sure these are the regulars but nice to see. This also isn't gourmet cooking. Its basic Greek food prepared really well. If you're looking for something fancy go elsewhere. There is both indoor and outdoor seating with a small bar right past the entrance. The menu is what you'd expect. There is a nice selection of wines and other drinks. Although I wouldn't remove any stars for this, there isn't necessarily a lot of parking in the area so you're better off biking it or taking public transport."
3,This is my first salad's place in Hamburg and it turned out to be great. Best thing is you can create your own salad with awesome sauces. There was a queue at lunch time but salad was great.I will definitely go again!
0,"Had duck with vegetables and rice with peanut-curry sauce. The meat, if it was meat, tasted absolutely artificial and the sauce neither tasted like peanut sauce nor had a kind of curry taste. Somewhat unidentically! The meat was extremely tender and underneath the panade was dough or something. The ""meat"" to my mind was some kind of fake which had no meat content at all. Overall it was a really unpleasant experience. Never again!!"
3,"My friends constantly referred to this place as the best Turkish restaurant in Hamburg, so we finally went there on Saturday at 2 AM. I was not disappointed! I only tried the Doner Teller, which was of decent size, and good taste. It was a bit cold, but nothing too serious.The service was great, even though the restaurant was full at 2 AM! Will definitely come by next time I am around the area"
4,"I love this cafe. When I was there they played great music...David Bowie, some fifties music, some hip hop, very eclectic. They are open late on the weekends and have a full bar. St. Pauli is a nice neighborhood of Hamburg, and this cafe was super cozy. The vibe was very chill, the prices were fair, they had soy (soja) milk. I got the latte macchatio with soy cold and it was delicious. The Wifi is free, the staff is super friendly and young. The atmosphere is hip without being pretentious. I felt very comfy. They also have a lot of local events listed on the walls, and the staff spoke great English as well. Lots of cool german magazines to read. Some outdoor seating as well. And, its was fun to try the 'deathpresso'....Dont miss this spot"
1,"Cool ambience place that was full, people were in a waiting list for tables.Thank goodness I just wanted to pick up some take away.I had to wait forever for a menu since the waitress that wanted to get me one just disappeared. After searching for another waitress I got one.I asked for a Bacon Burger with double patty and asked for it to be rare. They told me they only do medium. Since that always means it's dreadfully overcook I asked for it to be as rare as they can possibly do it. I also ordered chili cheese fries for over 6 euros and an Oreo shake for 5 euros and 2 dips.After a while I received my food and went home:A dip was missing. The very very expensive chili cheese fries were literally a small portion of normal fries with a tiny cheese dip on the side (over 6 euros!).And of course, the burgers were dreadfully overcooked. All grey & dry. Meat densely pressed together, not a single trace of anything even remotely pinkish. (While waiting for my food I have seen some burgers with pink Centers being medium, still not rare enough).The shake was VERY tasty. It was really really good. But the price of 5 euros for the small amount is not justified at all. The price of the ridiculous fries took the cake.Always looking for good burger places this place showed potential but disappointed with extreme prices for deceiving product and tough meat that was pressed too hard. Ground meat needs to be fluffier.My 25 Euro tab was just disappointing, considering I did not even get one of my tiny 2 Euro dips."
4,Incredible restaurant! We had our wedding party here and the employees went above and beyond to help us make it special. Not to mention the food was incredibly delicious! I had the salted sea bass. Yum!!!!!! We will definitely return for more excellent food soon again.
4,"Very very good burrito. Dead friendly staff, quick service, delicious burritos and good beer. Only slight criticism is the lack of cheese topping, but can't fault them on the filling. Good price too. I'm definitely becoming a regular. Going to have to try the steak burrito pretty damn soon."
4,"First time visiting Hamburg and happened upon this gem! This is the most fantastic pizza...I love it...seriously. #likeseriouslybestpizzaeverPros:*As I said, it's one of the best pizzas I've had. Worth every penny.*Quick; ordered when I got there and it was ready in about 10 minutes (no line when I arrived)*Friendly; every employee was kind and had a smile; they were very patient with the ""unsure American"", lol*English-speaking; much to my benefit, the employees spoke English -- I would not have been able to order otherwise.Cons:*small place; not appropriate for a sit-down meal if that's what you want*can be pricy; I got a ""large"" (medium by U.S. standards) with ""all the meats"" (which actually surprised the employees, lol) and paid about 13EUR -- but also like I said, worth every penny!*maybe not the best place/location/area of town for small children*CASH ONLY (I've found this is rather typical around the area in general, but this place only takes cash...be prepared)"
3,"first time here. Came with a group of people, actually 20 people. Really great for group. Food is great. I order extra no 4, it was pork and lamb skew mix with fries. The meat was nicely grilled. The guy next to me ordered a lamb plate, also looking really good. Probably gonna try it next time. Well, what is funny is I just found out lemonade in Germany is actually sprite. Well maybe I will try beer here next time."
4,Clean and well maintained! This is one of the highlights in Hamburg! Worth to check it out for picture with your friends.
2,"Turmbar is certainly unique. It's a little bar in an old water tower (?) thing. Walking to the bar seemingly takes forever, going round and round in circles. At the top there is a little bar that serves most of what you'd expect. The main problem is the slight lack of windows!"
4,You want to eat great steak/food? Go here. I visited the Delta Bistro twice already and each night was an awesome experience. Try the tomahawk steak (800g). 60 Eur for that gorgeous piece of meat but it's worth every cent! The service is quick and friendly. 5 stars well deserved!
1,"The food is very disappointing but the service is great!! This place is decorated really well and as soon as you walk in you feel like you're over at someone's home. They have cute couches, coffee tables and dining room tables everywhere. There even is a cabinet with children's books. So overall it looks perfect! The staff was really friendly but where it all went wrong was the food. I ordered the couscous salad and what I got is a massive plate with one small scoop of couscous which was in ball shape and two leaves on top of the couscous. I was expecting a salad, since they advertised it and two leaves of lettuce do not make a salad. The couscous was SO small it was barely enough to feed a small child. The couscous tasted a little bit crunchy and they definitely overdid it with the oil, it was leaking in oil. Food deserves one star but the fact the restaurant looked cute I bumped it up to two stars."
4,"I try to visit HH at least once a year and Mo-Grill is always one of my first stops after I get to the city. Of course, we all know from reading ""The Invention of Curried Sausage"" novella by Uwe Timm that Currywurst was first created in Hamburg and the claims by Berlin are quatsch. The food at Mo-Grill is great -- served fast and hot by friendly folks and their expansion has not affected the quality. There's also a peculiar Hamburg ambiance with everyone standing around small tables eating with lots of people walking past. Nothing like it anywhere else!"
2,From 1 (worst) to 5 (best)Food taste: 3 Good.Food variety: 4 Many.Price: 3 ModerateMobility: 5 Easy by public and private transport. Recommendation and comment:Many would find the taste is good.
3,"The Rathaus is a pretty magnificent building right in the heart of Hamburg. You can just wander in off the street. Definitely a must see for visitors to the city, shame I don't know much about the place other than it's impressive. My only niggle with the place is the current exhibition they're running; although I personally don't have anything against it, I think perhaps it's a bit overt for children? So maybe if you're there as a family you might want to check it out before taking them in."
4,Xiao Xang Garten is a really wonderful restaurant situated in Elmsbüttel in Hamburg. The staff is very much considerate with the diners and very friendly and professional. We were invited by German friends who made us discover this most pleasant place. All the dishes we had were excellent. We strongly and heartily recommend this Chinese restaurant which is very quiet and intimate.Michel and Marie Moulin Lyon France
2,"1. homeless could come in to beg for food while you are eating ( so environment is bad) 2. food quality --- bad ( I'm Asian, so maybe I'm too strict on the taste.) 3. cheap --- so I still go there from time to time. When it get better, I will reverse my review :)"
3,"At the higher end of the Hamburg restaurant spectrum, and also a little bit off the beaten track, being as it is in Aldstadt, and nobody comes here at night. However, I had a good time here. The service is excellent, and the standard of food very good too. My main gripe would be that it's completely dead midweek, so really not somewhere you'd want to eat, unless of course, you like sitting alone. As we were having a meeting, that worked out pretty well."
4,"When I first came here just over a year ago I was shocked that such a place existed in Hamburg. It's really great, but I can't imagine coming here much more than once a year.. playing sports in soft sand is just too tiring! Both of my visits here have been for a beach football competition. The first time I was injured and so hung around drinking beer all day. More recently (last weekend) I was playing and I'm still feeling the pain. Beach football is dangerous! Still, it's a great asset for Hamburg to have such a facility."
4,wie immer sehr fleischig!
3,"Great food, very limited seating options. Expect to queue for a seat around lunchtime. The real menu is scribbled in chalk on various blackboards situated around the restaurant."
3,"I always really enjoy Vapiano's food  freshly-made with creative combinations for their specials! I've always had good fresh (I guess you'd call it fusion) Italian pasta here, great flavors and for a reasonable price. Also some nice dessert and wine choices. Sometimes can be a bit crowded, but I still enjoy the atmosphere  a good deal for the price if you're in the mood for some pasta!"
3,"I love the french toast with maple syrup and fresh freuit. for 5,00€ i think it is a pretty good deal.I'm tempted to try out the salads but I know that my bill will be a LOT more expensive. but I'm sure it is all very delicious!the place is always PACKED on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/Brunch... if you don't reserve, you might not have a chance.my only disappointment is that they list red velvet cupcakes on their website as a kind of the baked goods, but I've been there several times and they never have them available. :-(  whyyyy?!?!  i would be so many and so often. ;-)"
4,"My favourite Italian restaurant ever. Reasonable prices, great menu and great service. Some of the best service I've had in Germany - not that there's much competition."
4,"We could not believe how much delicious food we received for such a low price. Seriously, some of the most flavorful curry I've had. We had curry chicken, butter chicken, Palma paneer, and vegetable Sampras.  Order at counter and buzzer when food  is ready, but so delicious!"
4,"Sehr stylischer Laden und die Pizza ist auch lecker.Die Pizza ist zum selberkonfigurieren und dann am besten draußen essen und ein bischen Menschen schaun, das ist auf St. Pauli ja immer eher unterhaltsam."
4,"Miniatur Wunderland deserves its reputation. They make you travelling through different countries like the US, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria.. The details are fascinating and you won't have the time to get bored. How they conceive the cities is truly impressive and you will be immersed in this miniature world."
3,"Keep coming back for the fried noodles and of course Vietnamese Ice Coffee! The restaurant can be very packed during lunch time or dinner time. I don't know if what they serve is authentic, but I'm pretty sure it's tasty!"
4,enchiladas de mole are amazing !
3,"Great source for Hamburg's bestest chips. And I hear their Currywurst is much appreciated by the carnivores, too.I can only rate their Grillgold (chips) which is excellent. Tomato sauce, mayonnaise and vinegar are splashed out for free. Nice! Prices are generally okay seeing that they sell e.g. organic Wurst. :)The grill master can be a little slow indeed but has as yet never been unfriendly.Schmitt's is always a good place of refuge before the drinking starts - or after the drinking has been done.I have heard rumours of people who came in twice on one single night Addictive so! ;)"
2,"Fine but not stellar sushi.  One of the few sushi places I passed on my wanders that actually had customers, which is a good sign.I got a basic Menu 4, with some roe-covered California rolls and two nigiri; the fish was in that middle bland area, not tongue-bursting fresh and not old.  Rice was fine, and not too gummy.OK if you're in the area, but maybe not worth much of a trip."
2,"I came here with a group of 12 last weekend for my friend's going away dinner and drinks celebration. The location, weather and atmosphere were all lovely. After living in Hamburg for seven months, it was a revelation the city had such a lovely spot. It was very crowded, so there was a long wait to get my Falafel burger. Unfortunately, it was expensive (10 Euro), was accompanied by literally 5 potato wedges and it costs about 10 Euro. Similarly the cocktails were expensive and very watery. The group I was with had similar experiences. So skip the food and get a beer instead"
2,"Being used to award-winning burgers back in the States, I was hoping that Billy the Butcher would satisfy a month-long burger craving since I moved here. I ended up walking away satisfied, but not blown away. I ordered their maxed out burger, which came with bacon, sautéed onions, and a fried egg. The ingredients were high quality, and the burger was topped with a tasty, albeit too sweet burger sauce. The meat itself was on the bland side, and lacked a proper seasoning. Fries (a separate order, as the burger only comes by itself) were a refreshing mix of about 2/3 regular, and 1/3 sweet potato fries, and came topped with a rosemary based seasoning that was original. For a 13-14 euro lunch meal, it could have been better."
2,"Atlas Restaurant is somewhat hidden in a relatively modern business district in the northwest of Altona. Like some of its surroundings, the restaurant oozes a bit of the red brick loft style that was so fashionable a decade ago. Unfortunately the dining room was rather empty on the evening of my visit, which - together with the empty (except for the cloth and a single candle) tables - made the place feel a bit barren. Service was fast and friendly throughout the evening and is one of Atlas' strong suits. The food, on the other hand, was a bit of a mixed bag. The evening menu is competitively priced (at 28 Euros per head) and includes three courses, which leads one to expect above-average, brasserie style cuisine. The salmon tartar starter was accompanied by pulpo, melted tomatoes and pickled cucumbers - a combination I personally didn't quite understand. The salmon tartar was decent, if a bit bland on its own, but how the other elements should be combined harmoniously eluded me, despite many attempts. The main, Boeuf Bourguignon, was better: the meat was tender and the sauce rich (in a good way), only the vegetables were slightly too tough.Desert was a lovely mousse au chocolate cake with pistacchio ice cream, which left very little to be desired, indeed. Atlas Restaurant is offering more than decent food at a good price. Maybe I'd just caught the wrong day of the week, but I'd probably not go there for dinner again, if the place is always as empty in the evening. Just in terms of food there is little to keep one from exploring the backyards of Altona."
4,"I already passed this bar many times on my way to the schanze. Never went in because of the tight packed crowd.Until last friday, I arrived early, lucky to find seats on the bar! Perfect setting, when you feel like drinking!Around 10oclock it was getting more crowded, which only improved the chill, social atmosphere.A goodlooking dj played funky background sounds, although, unfortunately, this is not the place to dance your night away...Perfect for starting off though!The caiprinhias were amazing, so was the service (only woman...?!), and after some tequilla gold shots I was feeling like I wasnt able to leave this place ever again! Or else...come back for sure! Prices are reasonable, luckily! Another reason I should go back...There was supposed to be an aquarium in the middle of the room (cool!!), I did had some thoughts..but yeah, to be sure, definitely have to come back to have a closer look!"
4,"Visiting Hamburg for 6 days and we've decided to have dinner again at Xeom.Loved the food and service.Great food, atmosphere and a very fair price."
1,"Very disappointed having made this a ""must do"" evert time I'm in town. The service was good. The lobster bisque Ok, and the penne beef pasta boring flat and not worth eating. My colleague ordered a gin and tonic and couldn't finish it. We ordered the tiramisu and there wasn't the hint of liquor in it - ""safe for all ages"". Not what I want from one of my favorite desserts."
4,"Love the food, super taste, fresh and well priced. Good service. I wonder if they have home delivery. My family loves this place. From their grilled chicken, I make more dishes quickly at homeyummy food. Must try."
3,"This is the first time I have been in this restaurant,it is a Very nice persian enviromental restaurant,very good varities of meal and services with reasonable prices.sertainly I would recommend this restaurant to eat in."
4,"We were able to book a last minute tour here in English. The guide was very informative and taught us a lot about the whole chocolate making process. We also got to taste the chocolate at different forms in the process and make our own bar to take home. If you're planning on visiting, I would recommend booking early, as there are not as many English tours available. Another bonus is that the bathroom here is FREE."
3,"A great place for a get-together.  The atmosphere is inviting, buzzing;  the lighting, the sparking glassware here, the stacked bottles there,  the open table seating with little nooks here and there - - it is a great place to be.  The drawback being, that it gets loud.The food is on one page at the back of a massive drinks menu, but the quality shines.   The salads were big and beautiful,  and the flammkuchen with crème fraîche, spring onions, speck, and pfifferlinge was perfect - - beautiful balance of ingredients, satisfying creamy base, and just delicious.The wines were OK.  The recommended red from our stellar server opened up nicely over time.  My two whites had character, but were nothing I'd buy in.    The staff were knock-out attentive, gracious, and capable.   The were super busy, but always responsive."
4,Wow. Simply delicious food & really excellent service. I was a single diner here during a business trip in Hamburg and will make a special effort to return every time I'm in Hamburg!
4,"What a lovely place. Feels like ""Little Italy"" in Hamburg.Coffee, sandwiches, baguetts and other small things makes the time there timeless.Fantastic place to relax, enjoy and chill Clear recommendation!!"
4,"Top of the line as far the currywurst I've had in Germany! Really nice guys in here - great service, and all cooked to order. The seating area outside is cool and has a decent patio heater to keep you warm. It's the perfect place for a quick snack before visiting the cinema down the road. Good stuff."
3,"This place is always packed with young people. Very nice atmosphere and extremely cheap coffee. You can buy there soft drinks, snacks and cakes too."
3,"This is a pretty big and nice Irish pub. You've got your typical Guinness and Magners but also surprisingly a large selection of craft beer. I had the 'Zweitel' and that was pretty damn good. This is a great place to hang out with others but as I came to watch the footie; they have 2 TVs on which they show games, it was a little disappointing with the music playing and no game sounds being heard hence the loss of a star. Great bar to hang but not super great to watch football in my opinion."
4,Really good vegan breakfast foods! I had the scrambled tofu and my girlfriend had the blueberry pancakes and it was both delicious! We had to wait a little bit to get a seat and to get our food but the tasty food makes up for it. Definitely bring some time and hunger!
4,"I love this place. Great for a date, for going out with your friends, taking your parents when they are visiting. It is better to reserve!"
3,"Yum! By word of mouth I ended up at Quán dò last night and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is small and stylish. Red walls and colorful lanterns turn up the fun factor here. We waited a few minutes to get a table inside and it was worth it. I got the bun with sesame pork and it was simple and savory. I like how Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg don't use msg so the food tastes fresher and cleaner. My bun was good! It came with cucumbers, carrots, peanuts, rice noodles, and grilled pork. My green tea came out scorching hot so I had to wait a while to drink it. Quán dò is good for people watching, grabbing a bite to eat before you hit the town, or just to have a casual night out with a buddy. I will definitely be back. CASH ONLY."
3,"Really unique, genuine and nicetasting kebab! Tried the durumone which wasnt that big which accounts for 4 instead of 5 stars. Very affordable though so what can you expect."
2,"Went there for a business dinner. Recommended by a colleague.The beer is good, but given the fact that they are a brewery, choices you have a a bit sparse.The craft been (only one available) is lacking a proper description.Food is OK. Waiters however were good - friendly, quick. Location is very nice.Noise Level to high for business lunch - unless of course you are looking for Nomunication."
4,"Super friendly staff that made you feel like you were in Italy until you stepped back out in the Hamburg rain. The pizza was amazing and I managed to finish one on my own, which is rare, but it was so good I simply couldn't stop."
3,Nice place to eat a burger in the center of Hamburg. It was quite busy but my order didn't take very long to prepare. Decent prices. Will visit again!
4,My two kids loved the joy of ordering on a tablet and swiping the meal themselves! Good food and good atmosphere. Will be back this week.
0,"Save your €26.50 and head to a real restaurant.  This one is a joke for service and value for money. Eaten in many places like this all over the world, and  don't expect much.  Buffet is extremely basic for the money, pre cooked food was with cheap ingredients and small choice.  ""Live Cooking"" is ok, although hygiene of the food is far from ok.  Flies buzzing around the mounds of uncooked meat and fish and the cook didn't seem to know what he was doing.  The very small selection Sushi was awful, cheap and dried out.  The tiramisu was a mushy mess left in the bowl, the scraps from others desert helpings.  Asked the head waiter if they had a fresh tiramisu, who did get a fresh one, but proceeded to moan at his customer that normally you need to finish off the scraps before they can change, or their boss gets angry... All in all, save your disappointment and keep on walking..."
4,"Had some really good chicken wantan with a sweet chili sauce and then an excellent Panäng Gai (chicken red curry), Number 90. Very quick and friendly service. Handy location near Kampnagel. Will have to try some Vietnamese dishes next time. Can definitely recommend."
4,"Crispy duck is so good here!! I've only ever had takeout, while staying at the Park Hyatt in the same mall complex, but they are prompt and the food is delicious. I keep going back thinking I'll try something else, but seats get the same dish.For foreigners, it is cash only (no international cards)."
2,"FYI: I only rate the food! :)We went there to have some proper Japanese ramen, this place was recommended by my sister who lived here (Hamburg) for around 3 years - according to her it is one of the few ramen shops.We were excited. We had fried chicken, 2 bowls of ramen (the 12/13€ ones, can't remember the names), and 1 dessert (mochi ice cream). The chicken was good, fresh, good coating, crispy and the chciken was really soft and juicy. It lacked some flavor in my opinion, but I was aware that Japanese tend to have quality food with less intense flavor, natural. There was a dipping sauce, was ok, but I wished there was some sea salt or other additional dipping. Would order it again!The ramen, the main attraction, was a little disappointing, I am afraid to say that. I was looking forward to the broth - it was indeed rich and thick - but it had really little flavor, personally I liked some ramen better back in Japan (like street food ramen for 5€). It lacked the soothing taste of rich porky flavor, Indon't know how to describe. The ingredients, noodles, pork meat were ok too. I wish I could have given a positive review for the ramen, but it was just ok.The mochi ice cream was good, nothing too exciting, but a refreshment after the rich and fatty food. SUMMING UP: I wish it was our favorite ramen shop nearby, but it is not. Whenever we feel like having soothing ramen (esp. on cold winter days), we wouldn't think of the ones here. Even though it is not bad, it wouldn't be satisfying either. The chicken was the best, followed by the dessert. While the ramen in total was almost good, the main criteria for me, the broth, didn't give me that sense of satisfaction I am looking in bowl of ramen.Maybe we will try it out again, in winter, but until then we will hunt for another ramen (if there is any).Not included in rating: The price for everything (fried chicken, 2x ramen, 1 dessert, 2 drinks) was 45€, not good value in my opinion, compared to the expectations I had. The service was nice and quick."
0,"NOT authentic pho!im asian and live in a viet heavy community so i knownoodles wrong type and broth is wrong flavorno tendon, tripe etceggrolls look like lumpiathis restaurant is scamming the german customers who dont know any better!"
4,"Great Greek restaurant. We walked into the restaurant at midnight on a Saturday night. It was still opened until 2am. The waiter was not so nice but I can understand given the time. For only 12€50, I've got a big plate with pork Souflaki, tzatziki, gyros and fries. They even offered us a salad in entrance. The flavors reminded me when I was in Greece few years ago, so good job!"
4,"One of my favourite restaurants of the area. They got a lot of nice Portuguese and Spanish food on offer as well as the usual San Miguel and Sagres beer. Loads of yummy seafood things (meat, too, for all you carnivores) and great tapas. All very delicious. Aioli and bread will get served before the main meal so you can feast on that first. And it's worth it. Even though your partner / colleagues will hate you later on / the next day.The waiters are really pleasant - and always happy to deliver a wisecrack on top of it all.Prices are moderate especially compared to the other Portuguese restaurants in the middle of the street.It's strongly recommended."
3,"This place is pretty good. I have my favorites in Hamburg when it comes to Currywurst but you can't go wrong with these guys, be it left or right side of the road or their newer location on the Jungfernstieg. The people are pretty nice and I haven't yet ever received a bad Wurst. It tends to be fairly packed which somehow adds to the charm. It wouldn't be the same if no one else was there. It is tough at times though to find even the narrowest of space to put down your plate to stand there and eat."
4,"We went here on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. We were greeted and looked after by very friendly and knowledgeable staff from our arrival to our departure. A lovely bowl of spicy krupuk crackers was a tasty appetiser followed by a whole steamed perch (Rotbarsch) with a light orange and ginger sauce, cooked to perfection and served with boiled rice. All very reasonably priced in a stylish, modern restaurant."
0,"This restaurant has the distinction of having the rudest waiters I've ever encountered in a life of eating and traveling. I lived above this restaurant for six weks and ate there only once, my first night in Hamburg. I went in alone after having slept all day following an exhausting trip. I walked in, slightly disoriented because I expected something different than the nice surroundings. A  waiter with an overly-tailored beard approached me in English and gruffly asked me if I wanted to eat inside or out. I apparently took a few seconds too long to decide and exasperated him. ""Inside or out?"" he demanded. Only because I was famished and still exhausted did I stay. I sat in a secluded corner and was ignored for fifteen minutes, then requested service from another waiter who was busy doing something behind the bar. I wasn't happy, but too tired to leave. No takeout. Great. He then felt it necessary to lecture me that I wasn't in America when I simply offered a curious comparison to the size of the coffee cup presented. He eventually lightened up and complained that I tipped him too much. (I kept getting conflicting information about tipping in Germany). The owner did come over and ask if I liked the meal. It was just okay, but I said it was very good, other customers seemed to be having a good time. This wasn't enough. He looked at me for a moment (the stare) and didn't say anything else, then turned and left. They had an inflated opinion of the restaurant and of themselves, an arrogance similar to what I encountered often in Hamburg, but nowhere else in my travels throughout Germany and Paris this past summer. A sweet young lady smiled and said goodbye as I left, as the first waiter tried to make a point of ignoring me as he dried a plate. I really wished I had had dealings with her instead of these arrogant fools. This experience was so surprising because I had just stayed a week and a half at the Hotel  Kempinsky in Berlin where I experienced, with one exception, nothing but the absolute best service, most professional demeanors, and genuine smiles at all times."
3,"One of the only restaurants with terrace overlooking the Elbe and the beach in one of the nicest and oldest areas of Hamburg where the old Captains' and fishermen's houses are lining a pedestrian street. The only thing missing are cobblestones. Only the walk along Oevelgoenne is worth it: the abundance of flowers, the meticulously maintained houses and the views of the Elbe and the sunlovers on the beach make you distinctly feel on holiday. The restaurant is primarily axed on fish and shellfish with soups based on lobster, shrimp cocktail and classic fish preparations as main course. Some innovative touches like dried flower petals in the soup). Nice place to linger, but it is also a popular place, so you cannot linger too long.."
4,"Honestly one of the best tourist attractions in the world. You absolutely must see this place at some point in your life. Miniatur Wunderland is a massive museum of models. It started out as just model railways, and indeed railways do continue to make up a significant portion of the place, but it's expanded to so much more. There are glorious mountainous scenes, recreations of the world's great cities, and piles and piles of cars and humans as well. My personal favourite is the model airport, with a huge selection of planes, terminals, fuel trucks, passengers. Literally everything has been thought of. The planes even land and take off in front of your eyes! Tremendous!The detail throughout the place is astounding. I literally spent 10 minutes just staring at the football stadium, where a match between Hamburg and St. Pauli was happening. The spectator's excitement, the floodlights. Top class. Another little detail that caught my eye was when I peered into a random office building, and saw two colleagues secretly kissing in the office. A tiny detail that most people probably don't see, but it is so realistic and well thought-out. I'm sure these details are evident throughout the Wunderland. Would love to hear about some others from people. :)It's well worth the entrance cost. You can really see where your money is going when you pass by the workshop and see the newer areas being constructed. I can't even imagine the sheer number of hours that went into creating this, and there's more being built all the time. By paying your entry fee, you are helping create something amazing!There is a shop and restaurant on site, both of which are reasonably priced, and have a selection of stuff. The shop has a huge variety of models and toys and collectibles. The restaurant interior is designed to look like sitting on a train or in an aeroplane. Very cool.In conclusion, if you're anywhere close to Hamburg, please PLEASE visit Miniatur Wunderland. I don't regret it one bit, and hope to be back to see your new creations in the future. :D"
2,"Hier habe ich öfter ein kleines Frühstück genossen oder auf die schnelle ein Kaffee. Jedes Mal fand ich die Bedienung SEHR freundlich und hilfsbereit, das Essen schmeckte, und die Einrichtung finde ich nett und atmosphärisch. Leider habe ich heute die Minestrone bestellt.Die Suppe war dünn, und hell Braun mit kleine, oben-schwimmende Fettaugen. Grundsätzlich habe ich nichts gegen Fettaugen, wenn sie zum Geschmack beitragen. Nur diese Brühe hatte leider keinen Geschmack. Die bunten Zucchini Würfeln und sehr wenige Bohnen und Weißkohl Streifen konnten alleine die Braune Brühe nicht zum Leben erwachen. Knoblauch?  Fehlanzeige, Pfeffer?  Fehlanzeige, Salz?  usw. Seltsam finde ich es, dass die Brühe Braun war, und scheinbar nichts (Geschmacklich) mit dem Gemüse zu tun hatte.Nein, ich habe mich nicht Vorort beschwert aus dem einfachen Grund, dass ich wenig Zeit hatte und gar keine Lust hatte auf ein Grundsatzdiskussion über der Definition von Minestrone, und verschiede kulinarische Interpretationen davon.Das Erlebnis heute war enttäuschend. Ich hoffe, dass Engelke beim nächsten Besuch besseres zu bieten hat."
4,"I love this place. It's nearby, is a classic bar, and the Polish owner/bartendar remembers every time that I am from Slovakia. Their food is basic but good...it's not a gourmet place, yet I've always been happy and never went home hungry. The bar is well stocked and they have a nice selection of beers I like. Sitting at the bar or in one of the ""cubby's"" each has its benefits and drawbacks. At times, the place can get tight as it's not that big. At the same time, it's very ""gemütlich"" which I consider one of the major draws for me. Finally, the Zwiebelkuchen rocks as does the Tzaziki. Both great companians to a good beer."
2,Nice bar at the beginning of the Reeperbahn between Operettenhaus and Schmidt's Tivoli Theater. Perfect place to start the evening or have a chilled evening during the week. It can get very crowded on weekends. The bar has all the usual drinks. There are several djs that play at Hörsaal.
3,"I absolutely loved this place. Was in Hamburg on business and was trying to check out some local restaurants that were also trendy. Went with 4 of my colleagues and we had such a wonderful time - the linguini was fantastic and the wine (Nero) was impeccable. We especially enjoyed the two waiters who were warm, helpful and full of life. Charming experience!"
3,Really good Greek food. its always full so book a table.
4,"Charming space. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Warm and welcoming. Efficient service. Fantastic seafood. Great drinks. Reasonably priced. Classy, but not at all stuffy. The Labskaus was excellent. It's kind of like a seafood tartare. Lovely. Excellent soups and sauces. Highly recommended. Would definitely return."
3,"Nice museum with art from the 16th century and onwards. Logically displayed so it was easy to follow how art forms has developed through different eras. Nice to look at paintings from Degas, Monet, Renoir, Picasso  to modern artists. Close to Hauptbahnhof so easy to get to."
3,This is a really nice restaurant! Really relaxing and enjoyable. I ordered a sandwich with pesto and it was really good!
4,"I never thought I would be a fan of the currywurst..unless it is at 4am in the morning after a big night out where anything would taste good!! However, Curry Grindel has completely changed my viewand my tastebuds! They are brilliant and the chips are great tooand to think that this place is just at the end of my street! Great place for a quick snack and if you ever have visitors to Germany.this is the place to introduce them to the currwurst!"
3,"I've now been here three times and can say I think the food is stupidly good for the price (~6€ per meal). I've ordered the palak paneer thali the last two times and would highly recommend this dish (spinach with cheese cubes).This is a pretty small place with authentic Indian food served on metal trays. You order at the counter, get a buzzer, then pickup your food, which is divided into entree, rice, yogurt, side salad, side chickpeas, and naan. Everything is really fresh tasting and delicious, besides the small salad which is really boring (but whatever, ignore it). I could easily recommend this place if you want some authentic Indian food."
2,The service was good. The burgers were a bit too dense/ over cooked. It wasn't the best burger - just soso. The fries are very good though and the salad was nice.
3,Always go here when in hamburg. It's god great schnitzel which is always good. Nice location overlooking the canal in central hamburg. Only issue with the place is the service is painfully slow. Been here 3 times now and every time had to ask a few times for a beer or a table or a menu. They seem to be always busy so service is not something they have dealt with. Great place otherwise though and always a good atmosphere.
4,"My visit to Herr Max without a doubt was one of my Hamburg highlights. Friendly staff, ok prices, easy to find, great cakes and an extremely cool interior.It's hard to name Herr Max's style, but I guess I'd go for something like 'classic abandoned' or 'a long-forgotten castle', but all without making it a dirty or uncomfortable place. Absolutely not. I felt very welcome, and actually didn't notice most of the details - like the handdrawn skulls on every single plate on the wall and wall paper that looks like it's falling off - until I looked at my photos again at home. ;)They sell ice cream and cakes and although I'm sure the ice cream will taste great as well, I can only say: choose cake! Everything is homemade, looks (and smells) fantastic and the chocolate mousse cake I went for is amongst the best I've ever had. Because as soon as I took a bit, the topping got a bit more liquid and spread out over the whole cake as if it was sauce. SO DELICIOUS.Oh and they also have free wifi, fast enough to FaceTime (when you're a lonely traveler like I was) ;)."
3,"Just around the corner from my flat in Hamburg, this place is brilliant with a group or just on your own. I have eaten here a few times and its my favourite local. It does great Roast Potatoes and lovely Weissbier!"
4,"This is not my first time to visit them, but a first on a weekend. The service is still very good & it all arrive on a timely manner inspite being full house. They have a nice selection of drinks for both alcoholic & non-alcoholic drinker. Definitely will go back !!"
4,"Fabulous food menu changes daily. Today, soup, pasta and chicken and rice with curry tomatoe sauce.  Not a big curry fan but this was fabulous!!!  She sells all kinds of cookbooks too."
3,"Great burger, but with slightly too many customisation questions from the waitress.Historically this venue has had problems with slow food service, but after visiting on a Thursday lunchtime they seem to have worked these issues out."
2,A regular Starbucks place with nice and interesting interior and a truly nice views of the lake
3,"Jim Block used to be my favourite burger in Hamburg, but I've gone off the place recently. They display very little care putting their burgers together. The only things that sets them apart from other fast food burger joints is a) the higher priceb) you get a platec) the ingredients are of a slightly higher quality If you want a burger, are sick of the American chains, and don't want to spend the time to go to a real restaurant, then this is Jim Block's niche. You get a decent burger, no more"
4,It was pretty delicious ! Haven't had such a great falafel  in ages :) thanks ! Will be back soon
2,"Previously the Milk bar and now the sands bar. Weird name for a pub that is nowhere next to a beach! I went there after watching a movie at the close by Cinemaxx. I was there relatively early, around 9 pm, the place was still empty, so we secured places at the bar.The bartender and the waitress were very nice, and friendly.The clientele however is a bit older. The DJ kept on playing weird old music, and when we asked him to pump it up a bit, and play newer songs he refused, claiming that the average age here is around ""60"" (exageration!) and they wouldn't appreciate it. So besides the crappy music, the drinks were ok, large selection, tasty cocktails. a bit less than 10EUR / long drink which is fine!"
4,"Long live Sommersalon! My friends and I love this place. The music is a great mix of funk, hip hop and R&B - old and new school. The DJ's will stir up some James Brown with Kanye and throw in some Rolling Stones too. It's a really cool vibe. No fancy drinks, but who needs them? And absolutely no mind-numbing, repetitive techno beats. It's never our first stop, but we always end the night there. The dance floor is jumping after 1am. The place itself isn't so pretty, and it gets really crowded but you'll have a good time. Ladies - take tissues. They are always out of toilet paper."
4,"Kartoffel Keller! I loved everything about this restaurant. At first glance, Kartoffel Keller looks like any other restaurant from the front. That is, until you realize that it's actually in the basement! Open the old door and be greeted with plenty of old world deco. They use waxy candles that melt over a wine bottle and by the look at the wax, they only use candle light. The ambiance is a bit dark but it's fitting. On to the food! I love potatoes. I love everything about potatoes and this restaurant specializes in potatoes! The translation of Kartoffel Keller is Potato Cellar. I went straight to the potato salads because I love German potatoes salads back home. There were types I have never seen nor heard of before so I went for the one that was that sounded the most unique. Potato salad with young herring, onions, beet root and apple slices. Everything in the salad was excellent. The sauce was a bit more watery then you'd find back home but it helped coat all the pieces nicely. The onions added a nice spicy bite. The potatoes were a little bitey which is exactly how I like them. I ordered the potato stew with sausage for the main course. It was very filling. It's served in a pot hanging over a tea light candle to keep it warm. The stew consistency was a little thin for what I would call stew, but the taste was there. There was some ground sausage in it with some cased sausage as well. Both were excellent. Since it was almost Christmas, I had to order the Gluhwein. It was very well done as well. The spices weren't over powering and it was just sweet enough to overcome the winey vapor you get from hot wine. Combine the ambiance with the food and the price, this place is a winner in my book. Next time I'm in Hamburg, you know where to find me. :)"
4,"This place is fabulous! I have been there a few times after playing sports or with a group of co-workers. Service is attentive, not fake, funny, knowledgeable. Atmosphere is Greek at heart, sometimes there are Greeks from the neighbourhood gathering and singing. Food is delicious, portions are big, but not too big. The appetisers like octopus or sardines were not drowned in oil, but just delicious. We usually order other appetisers, too and mix food and drinks....  Drinks: I always have a retsina wine, which reminds me of Greece. Happy customer"
1,"The service is friendly but extremely slow. Waited 40min for an order that arrived incomplete. The quality is ok, but the food is overpriced. If you have time, patience and no other choice go for it, otherwise I would skip."
2,"We've enjoyed our diner at the Parlament. The building is very spacious and has a nice and fresh ambiance. Diner was nice, not excellent or very special, but for us - tourists on the go - it was ok. We sat down pretty early (5:15 pm) and could be seated right away. Guests who arrived later had to wait al little while, but in a crowded city like Hamburg, that is something you have to take in to account."
3,"Delicious and authentic buckwheat French galettes (crepes). The space here is lively, bright, and feels like that of a European country home-like atmosphere in a historical building that overlooks the canal. Good food and nice location...yeah, it's no wonder it's popular and why you should probably make a reservation.Both savory crepes that my wife and I ordered were delicious -- some of the best -- and prepared promptly despite how busy the restaurant was. I really don't think you could go wrong with any single one on the menu. We had some difficulty choosing because they all sounded very appetizing. We will definitely be back!"
2,"Perfectly good cafe with a good number of seats, music at an acceptable level and a decent range of drinks on offer. A nice selection of cakes too although the ones we had seemed to have dried out to a degree so maybe we were there just a little bit too late in the afternoon."
3,A pretty nice place for beer and food and a great place to sit outside in summer.
3,"I ordered the falafel-teller platter, which came with five falafel balls, humus, tzatziki sauce, and two vegetable sides. I chose cauliflower and chickpeas. The portions were very generous, so I was definitely full after finishing my meal.The cauliflower was my favorite part of the dish; it was spectacular, and I would definitely order this as a side if you come here. The falafel was good but not excellent -- I really enjoyed the texture (very soft yet crispy outside), but I didn't think it tasted as great as other falafel I've had (it was still yummy, though, don't get me wrong). Chickpeas aren't my favorite, so I don't know why I ordered this side, and I thought they were decent but not amazing (I enjoyed the tomato sauce).The tzatziki sauce was excellent (very flavorful), and I really enjoyed this along with the humus, which tasted great as a dip for the pita and falafel. The staff was very accommodating, and I liked the setup of the (small) restaurant quite a bit, with a variety of seating arrangements including lower couch-side seats. Overall, this restaurant had excellent service, atmosphere, and food, so I would highly recommend eating here. Although the falafel wasn't excellent, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and also saw some other great looking dishes around (including a fried empanada). I will be back here for sure."
3,"I was coming here quite regularly 3-4 years ago but gave up because only one big problem and that is the glutomat chemical which they put in almost everything to improve the taste. I came again to see whether something changed but I'm afraid not much. It's really pity because the place is really good, and most of food and specially dim sums are delicious. Staff should be more polite but this is usual problem when place is very busy, they dont have time for nicer approach. I wasn't sure wether to give 3 or 4 stars because glutomat is serious problem but in the end I gave the streched 4 star because delicious stem breads just landed on my table :-)"
4,"Probably the best pizza in Hamburg!Great lively place, crazy packed so the first challenge is to actually get a table here but if you manage to get it you're in for an experience. Great Italian menu but the pizza's are the highlights.The atmosphere is very lively dark with loud latin music mixed with communal and private tables."
3,"Great place for American breakfast: pancakes with maple syrup, eggs&bacon, coffee. Very casual and cool atmosphere. Americana-mania reached Hamburg! A bit too loud and not cheap. Definitely worth going once in a while, but not the healthiest choice for regular consumption."
4,Cozy and unique.I love this bar/lounge! Definitely will come back again since it has a wonderful indoor and big outdoor seating. The sofas are really stylish and probably even antique! The walls are just a master piece... its just a great place to have a drink with friends and chill out.
4,Best museum I have been to! Super cool and such an accurate architectural design. I loved the airport and runway design as I just love flights! Everyone will definitely love this. Worth every penny
3,"Haifisch Bar is such an archetype of a Hamburg harbour bar that it almost hurts to see its raw realness. Loads of dusty, mysterious memorabilia all over the place. Reminding you of the good old days when the rough sailors were there on shore leave for strong drinks, picking fights and the girls. The furniture and bar are very old-fashioned - but not in that trendy retro way, it just IS original. A bar, some stools, a few tables and that's it.The lady behind this bar is profesionally friendly and nothing like the big-mouthed trollop you'd expect. Drinks are free of any glamour so you'd get your plain Astra or Jever. Prost!I have also been there for a 2 funky fiestas thrown by a business friend for their clients. So apparently there was food involved for the media people, too. And guess what? It was home-style cooking à la Hamburg: a buffet consisting of meatballs, bread rolls with fish, fish cake and potato salad. And everybody liked it.. as spoilt as they may be. Amazing!Maybe some thought this place was especially set up for them as a big spectacle?! So it's definitely worth checking out even though it can get pretty touristy (No photography allowed!). But if you wish to experience the real Hamburg, please do go."
4,"War etwas skeptisch ob der stylischen Einrichtung, ungewöhnlich für einen türkischen Imbiss, dient aber nur zum weiteren Wohlfühlen. Superlecker das Essen, frisch. Irre nett und gastfreundschaftlich der Laden. Optimales Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Da gehich bestimmt noch mehrmals hin."
3,"When planning your trip to Hamburg, don't count on going to any museums on Monday, as they are all closed.  Except for this little culinary nugget :)We actually ended up here by default, after realizing everything else would be closed for the day.  We also found out that we would have to join in on the German tour, as they only do English speaking tours on the weekends.  Fortunately, this all changed when the tour guide was having someone shadow her because it was her first day.  This meant the seasoned tour guide could stay back and explain everything in English.Overall, this museum is really cool.  They walk you through the ways in which chocolate is made, from selecting the cocoa bean, to roasting, to processing, to the final product.  And they let you try the cocoa all along the way! It is also equipped with an opportunity to make your own chocolate bar, which is very cool.  This tour can  take up to 2 hours, so make sure you plan accordingly.  You definitely don't want to cut it short.Fun museum and would definitely recommend to those looking for something a bit different in Hamburg."
4,"It would be easy to walk right past this little place--I did just that the first time I was in the neighborhood! But don't do that--you want to eat here. This place is a lovely little gem.I came in around 8 on a Thursday night and took one of the last seats in the house. The atmosphere was great--lights low, wood fresh, good music (Jimi Hendrix, among others). It was easy for me to focus on the book I was reading, which was really nice.I couldn't make up my mind, so I picked the Knoedeltricolore and a glass of zweigelt. The zweigelt was the best wine I've had so far in Germany--smooth, slightly jammy. When the knoedel arrived a bit later, I had to take a picture because the three colors looked so pretty.For the three colors, you get a beet, spinach, and cheese dumpling. I believe all of them had ricotta inside--don't quote me. All of them were good, but I may have preferred the beet to the others. I ate my meal about as slow as I could, really trying to savor each bite. The salad that came with the dumplings was much better than your usual side salad with nice, fresh lettuce. I would go back here again in a second!"
4,When in Hamburg- must try this Italian gem ;) the creamy pasta with truffles is the most delicious dish I've had! You can share small dinner portion with the veal fillet ... OUT OF THIS WORLD. The waiters are all very nice and helpful- Bon App!
2,"A typical ice cream shop with a pretty large selection of your basic and expected flavors. It was good, but with so much competition in the area (Eishunger, Cellos...), this would probably be my last pick on Mühlenkamp to get a scoop in the future. If they had more interesting flavors or more attractive prices, then I'd come back!"
4,"Amazing mostly-vegetarian food, in a elegant yet comfortable setting.  Basically, my ideal dinner party.I had the risotto with Provence herbs and veggies (zucchini was the most memorable); creamy and cheesy, but still firm and not overcooked.  Feels like they might have a copy of the Moosewood cookbook, or something similar.I picked up the peanut and pepper soup and bread as a side --- again, immediately reminded me of the Moosewood.  The soup was savory, and the bread was fluffy but still hearty.The owner wasn't impressed by my first guess at a wine, and steered me towards a grechetto which better matched the risotto; I'm fine taking advice from someone who knows wine better, but there was definitely some steering.For dessert, I got the crème catalan --- a cinnamon version of a crème brûlée.  Tasty, but a bit puddinglike for my taste, and I would have been happy with half a serving.Many of the other reviews describe it as a vegetarian restaurant, but it does serve a few meat specialties like jamón serrano.Piccolo Paradiso serves the food I cook for myself --- and they do it better than I do."
3,"A really excellent venue, we came here since one of our daughters came here for a birthday party  it's the perfect place to tire out a large group of tweenagers! Since it was Winter (December) when I visited, I only managed to see the main indoor courts but it is a pretty amazing facility, with a number of huge indoor sand courts interspersed with rest areas and a central cafe. Surprisingly out of town, however its not far from the nearby u-bahn station so easy to reach on public transport."
3,"It's difficult to find good Asian restaurants in Germany that try to deliver a food experience close enough to their native kitchen in their homeland. The Quan Do is certainly a recommendation for those who despise the stereo-typical, sweet-sour fast food style pseudo Asian kitchen. The food is fresh, simple and soul soothing. For friends of a good Pho this is a good address. I also like their summer rolls.The staff is always friendly and competent, you can tell they like working there. The place is always crowded and does not take reservations, so at peak times you need to calculate some waiting time to be seated. The Quan Do is not a suitable choice if you're in a hurry to grab a lunch for example during your work break.The Quan Do is also nicely decorated with Vietnamese lamps hanging from the ceiling and nice photography of Vietnamese street scenes.I would grant a fifth star if the food was even more authentic to the taste in Vietnam or ethnic tribe area of South China, bordering Vietnam."
4,"Randomly happened to be here as a business partner picked it. Never had heard of it before. What a nice find. Love that their stuff is all organic. Super simple, yet stylish decor with a relaxed atmosphere. Service was truly top-notch and very helpful as well as attentive. Most importantly, the food (at lunch) was really good. I found the prices to also be very fair for the quality of food which you are getting. A bit of a pain to get to if you're coming by car (limited parking) or public transport (no subway right near by) but I will definitely make an effort to come back. Will bring my g/f along next time."
4,"Everything is probably ordered from oyster to Zander here, which lives in such a way in the water. In addition a spectacular view of the putting on maneuver of the England ferry comes. A beautiful interior arrangement, and evenly this view, invite to staying."
4,"Well known to hamburgers, but something of a secret for people from out of town, it's taken me 3 years to get there!Tucked away behind the exhibition halls in Lagerstrasse you go through what appears to be a Culinary Wholesaler, up an industrial staircase and enter a world of meat. Yes it's almost a palace dedicated to the consumption of flesh.Beautifully laid tables and Napiery, serious steak knives, great bread,  four types of salt, a warm greeting, promised that what would was to follow would satisfy deeply.I was just there for the meat and ordered a steak medium rare with some gratin potatoes. Delicious flavoursome meat. A very generous 250grams. I was in heaven. Hear fish is amazing too."
3,"When in Hamburg, you eat a hamburger, right?We'd had a long and exciting morning, traveling from Lubeck all the way to the airport and back into town, and needed lunch as soon as we got into town.  We walked out of the metro station, saw this place, and agreed that it made sense.  The place was packed, even at 2pm on a Friday.  Our group of 3 sent 2 to get food while the third held space for us to sit when we got our food - yes, it was that busy. The menu was all in German but with pictures to make it easy to understand.  I got the burger with the extra tomato relish and arugula, along with fries.  Most meals come with the combo, and I chose the sparkling water.   You order at the counter and then wait for your food to come up.  They're cooking it fresh, so it did take a few minutes to get the food.  The burger was cooked well, but was still juicy.  The bun was a little weak, but since everyone in the room was eating with knife and fork, they didn't mind that it was falling apart.  I also liked the crisp fries, even without ketchup, which I didn't get since it cost extra.  Portion was large - good deal for a lunch in Europe."
3,"I was walking around hungry in this fantastic neighborhood when this random German girl came up to me and suggested this place. And she wasn't kidding, the food here is top notch. Low key (meaning not fancy) decor, typical menu for this kind of cuisine but the quality is fantastic. I had the falafel with halloumi and it was fried on-the-spot...amazing. The counter is small and crowded, but service is brisk and you get your food fast even when there is a lineup (there is always one here apparently, which is a great sign). The crowd here is very mixed which makes it interesting. And it cheap, cheap, CHEAP (my dish plus bottled water around €5). Recommended!"
4,"Gaaaanz lecker und preiswert!!!! Ich stimme zu was die anderen geschrieben haben. Wer Kartoffeln essen will, geh einfach ein da man viel drauf auswahlen kann :-)"
3,"something nostalgic and very Japanese about this place. I figured out after donkeys ears of going to this joint that there is even a karaoke section somewhere in the cellar. you'll find groups of Japanese MIBs in the neighbouring tables which probably means it's not a japeusch concoction their delivering. daruma comes from the Indian word dharma btw. dharma as in dharmic religions Hinduism, Buddhism etc.  it also stands for the cute red paper figure lining the top shelves of this place. albeit a bit dusty. I suspect they haven't been dusted since the 70s. which is also the look and feel of the place BTW. recommend going here for an authentic Japanese experience with a hospitable Japanese family. the man cooks, the woman waits."
3,This place is perfect for a short stop. Good Service with very friendly servants will offer you a sattisfied stay at this bar. Also the food isn't expensive it is quite good and they are very uncomplicated with fullfilling special wishes and preferences.
3,"If you have ever been to a Sausalitos Bar before this one will not really be any different, excpet it is much bigger than any other I have been to before. It has a huge first floor and a smaller second floor. The cocktails happy hour is every day. You get a Jumbe cocktail for the price of a regular. The food is great especially if you are a mexican food lover. It is located in the Chille house which is in the back of the Moenkenbergstrasse. Every thursday they organize afterwork parties very very nice.cheers"
4,"Good donairs - crisply roasted bread with chunky lamb meat including enough fatty bits, fresh salad, good sauces - check!Good value for money - be seated with your Mini Döner - check!Friendly staff - check!Cosy in- and exterior in wood and warm colors that feel like Turkey and not like a fast food parlor, including good bathrooms - check!But what really clinches the 5***** is that they seem to be the only(!) donair place in Hamburg that still serves the more expensive lamb meat (for a modest surcharge), which is of course the original Turkish donair meat. Döner Queen nearby doesn't do so any longer - Dubara are the real donair deal."
4,"Authentic Italian restaurant that is said to be frequented by celebrities also. Wouldn't have wondered if I had met the Godfather himself there. You won't get served pizza, but tasty antipasti, pasta, and tiramisu. Luckily I didn't have to pay the bill!"
3,"This is a new breakfast favorite. Have been coming here for some time and never wrote a review. We like sitting outside on the upstairs balcony. Great people watching as well as a great breakfast. When it's too cold we prefer sitting at the bar upstairs and eating there. The service is super nice and breakfast is pretty varied and always tasty. One argument I have is that the place tends to be a bit smoke filled if too many smokers are around. Somehow the place doesn't air out well and if there are a bunch of smoker around, we turn around and head elsewhere. Otherwise, a great place that's very central and comfortable. Great place to hit for breakfast followed by shopping in town. If you come, make sure to sit upstairs....downstairs is kinda boring and if it's nice outside, you can sit out front or upstairs on the balcony. Don't forget though that the balcony fills up real quick. They also have heating towers outside and blankets so even on colder days, the outdoor option is one to consider."
3,"We just stopped in for a coffee and snack after a long walk, but was happy with the service and atmosphere. Would like to go back sometime for a more proper meal."
3,"After a team building event nearby our whole team from all of our company's different offices enjoyed dinner at Bullerei.  I was told by one of my colleagues that lives in Hamburg that this is owned by a famous local chef and is a hipster restaurant.  The atmosphere is farm hipster sheik.  Since we were a big group we had a set pre fixe menu.  They were very kind to ask us if there's anything we are allergic to or strongly dislike and I told them a few of mine.A delightful amuse bouche was brought out to us before the handful of appetizers.  Everything was served family style.  A hunk of glorious burrata was served and steak tartare for appetizers.  I love medium rare beef but just can't get myself to eat tartare; I heard it was excellent though.  The burrata was nice and creamy and served with plump tomatoes and arugula.  I've heard that seafood is huge in Hamburg, and for the second dinner in a row, I was presented with huge head on prawns.  For veggies they gave us a nicely dressed salad with the right amount of dressing.  They also served us corn on the cobs with a holder.  Corn was average.  We also ordered a few bottles of Sauvingon Blanc which was light and sweet enough for my picky palette.  Next up were the entrees which were hunks of beef and some salmon.  I am super picky with fish so I went for the beef.  It was a bit fatty but the pieces I got were perfectly mid rare.  It could have used more seasoning but they also gave us a few sauces to use.  Also accompanying our protein were delicious plates of asparagus and roasted potato slices.  Gotta have your veggies and carbs! I was already stuffed, but dessert was up next, and I'm always a sucker for dessert.  They gave us various bowls of fruit mousse, a cream mousse topped with fruit, chocolate mousse, and a huge bowl of scoops of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice creams.  We were a group of about 12 women and for us it was served family style, so not sure about what others mentioned about micro portions but we had a ton of leftovers to bring to the office the next day.  I feel like it's most of Europe though, with long leisurely dinners (we got here around 8ish and left around 11).  Service was attentive and the food was good, though my favorites were the steak, veggies, and dessert.  Everything was fairly average, and I don't think there's really an area of Europe that's really known for steak unlike areas of the US.  Everyone says it's a hipster place, yes, but the area is a hipster neighborhood too.  It's a bit of a trek from our office, but if you're in the area, I'd recommend it.  I'd say 3.5ish rounded up."
4,"My favorite attraction in Hamburg. If I have friends who are visiting, I bring end our tour of the Speicherstadt and Hafencity with an outing to Miniatur-Wunderland. I've been several times now and am never disappointed. You can spend hours just looking at everything. Great if you have kids with you but grown-ups will love it, too."
4,Excellent gyros and other Greek specialities from very friendly people who know their food. Also a great take-away selection.
4,"If you are into kebabs, then this place is a recommenation. Simply because of the very high turnover - surprising at this location - you can be assured that the food is always fresh. I found the service really fast. Prices are not dramatically on the cheap side, but worth it."
3,A great place to eat as a couple or with a group of friends. Great service and food. Moderately priced. Good atmosphere. All in all we had a great experience. We will definitely return.
4,"Amazing Breton style buckwheat crepes. I had the Nordique, which comes with smoked salmon and sour cream. The atmosphere was pleasant and nautical and my table shared a bottle of the house white wine which went perfectly with the meal. Ask for an English menu, there is one available."
3,Delicious taps and other full entrees too. It's a small but busy restaurant. A little cramped but since the food was good it did not matter. Good find
4,"Super cute ice cream shop ! The place is cosy, modern and full of charm.They have different and original flavours such as strawberry-rosmarin, salty caramel or coconut-strawberry. If you have allergies, it is really easy to understand how the ice creams are made of, thanks to a colours system. They also create vegan ice-creams ! You can either eat inside or take-away."
4,"Some weeks ago we finally went to the Deli section of the Tim Mälzers Bullerei. We ordered the Burger and some potato wedges. The staff was efficient, attentive and very pleasant (most of them good looking blond girls) and the wedges were tasty. After a long time in Australia I have to admit the burger was average, but it surely was the most healthy burger Ive eaten in a German restaurant. Tastewise I thought the sauce didnt fit the whole comipilation. Moreover we had cakes, which were massive. Apart from the burger the whole evening was great. Summing up the cost-benefit is high for Hamburgs standards."
4,"Great burgers and atmosphere. This is my favorite place in town, I've been there with friends several times and we all love it. I recommend the Gonzalez and the Big Rock Burgers, and if you are looking for a vegetarian option, the Black Beans Burger is really good. I highly recommend this place for a casual and relaxing dinner, just come with a bit of patience. Reservations are advisable for groups and weekend nights."
2,Beautiful view of Harbour in Hamburg however the service is incredible poor and unfortunately the cocktails are mediocre at their respective price point.Nice if you want a great view not if you're just interested in drinking
3,"Watched Deutschland lose their World Cup match here, which hurt the mood, but the food and beer were very good. I actually had the best Schweinshaxe ever and most of the time it is pretty good anywhere, you really need at least 2 people so don't order any apps if you go for that glorious piece of pork. Nice friendly service and good place to catch some sports action!"
1,"Disappointment. Seems I ordered the wrong food I guess. I paid €15 for the Lasagna with a side salad... Yuck. The lasagna was only pasta with the color red, no meat and only a slice of cheese on the top. Plus it smelled and tasted like fish. Do yourself a favor and order breakfast there. I even waited a day to write this to see if I would change my mind...."
3,"I really like the Irish Rover. It always makes me feel at home, being a traditional Irish set up, complete with live music on Sunday's as well. They recently introduced a lunch menu! It's a bit sparse so I've only ordered the fish and chips during the two times that I've been in since this addition. It's a huge plate. Definitely the largest piece of fish I've ever gotten in a fish and chips meal and tons of fries.During the evening, they have a feta dip on their menu that is outta this world good. I always ask for no olives and they're happy to do so.On the weekends, they have a full Irish breakfast available for brunch. So yummy and kid friendly. They have a high chair! I've been bringing the wee one with me since he was about 5 mo old, both for brunch and for dinner. I guess you're not truly Irish unless you've brought the babe to a bar.The cooking is great, the beer is delicious, the people are friendly and those will all have me coming back again :-)"
4,"Great atmosphere! Food and drinks were very good as well. 4 of us sat in the front bar area. Thumbs up for the shrimp ceaser salad, focaccia bread and potato soup. Food, 2 beers, a Moscow Mule, and wine coat around 60€. A little pricey but nothing we wouldn't pay for the cool, modern atmosphere and quality of food."
2,We were there during the happy hour. Our sahne cocktails were very very sweet and probably had no alcohol. It was not as expected at all and that is the 3 stars. Although their ambience is quite nice & the service is fast & good!
4,"Ja ja der Elbstrand, was wir da schon alles erlebt haben , (als wir noch jung waren xD) haben dort oft gegrillt, (Party gemacht) uvm. Ach ja . ich vermisse die Zeiten total .. aber man wird älter und hat nicht mehr so die Zeit wie früher :( Schade eig. aber naja kann man nicht ändern :( Der Elbstrand ist auf jeden Fall total toll =)"
3,"The best about this restaurant is the terrace and the view of the Hafen. When you combine it with a very friendly staff and great food, it's just perfect! We loved both their meals as well as desserts"
4,"I was lucky to get to visit the Exhibition 'Mahjong;' in the Hamburger Kunsthalle. This was an extensive exhibition that was curated with the highest calibre. The exhaustative exhibition told truths about China from approximately 1979 to 2005 through the work of many chinese artists. On entering this exhibition the first piece reduced me to tears and of course frightened my pal who ran off to hide in the toilets. The piece featured a giant sized wallet that framed video footage of the production of wallets in sweatshops, slaughter houses and high street designer stores. The video footage was also complimented by very sad violin music. The rest of the exhibition was a weeks worth of viewing, and expressive pieces that told us truths about China. We were educated with hard hitting expressive modern peices. The final pieces I viewed were some Mao propoganda graphics. I think this exhibition at the Hamburger Kunsthalle was one of the most outstanding of exhibitions I ever visited and i would of course always be interested to know what goes on in the Kunsthalle."
3,"I tried the palak paneer combo that was available at lunch. Overall, I was satisfied with the meal and had a nice siesta. The combo comes with yoghurt, black lentils, spinach paneer, zeera rice, salad and naan. What I did not like was that the portions for yoghurt and lentils were pathetic. So I find it funny that the black lentils was either too bland or too small a portion to even get a proper taste. Restaurant itself is, obviously, too small and may not appear too hygienic to certain folks. Based on my conversations with the locals including Indians, the place offers authentic Indian food and sweets are also a specialty here."
3,"When I'm hungry and I'm in the Reeperbahn area this is my favourite spot to get some fast food. Their Pide is really tasty, I'd definitely recommend it and they make it right in front of you. I've never been bothered to try anything else apart from it though , but they've got even Kebap here."
2,"The place is dark like Ali Baba's cave. You wait minimum 15-20 min. for such simple meal as crouques. Quality of sandwiches is ok, but nothing special."
4,"This was one of my favorite places while visiting Hamburg. Such a great welcoming vibe: old wooden tables, candles - cozy but not precious. The owner was extremely nice and they have an English menu too which was so nice after struggling to decipher German menus for weeks. I had the chicken burger which was incredible - full of flavor, topped with bacon and all the usual toppings. Highly recommend!  I enjoyed it with a Petit Chablis which I rarely see for sale in the US - definitely not a wine snob approved pairing but it hit the spot. If you're in the area definitely try this spot out!"
3,"It'sbeen ages since I was at Panter last time. To my satisfaction my visityesterday confirmed that: a) this place is as cool as it was before b) cosy, unpretentious, good quality c) friendly service d) unfortunately limitedchoice of drinks, i.e. wine This place will suite you if you are looking for a nice & cosy place to have a coffee and chat. It's not spectacular, just good."
0,There really are NO DISGUSTING words that I could possibly muster to perfectly describe what a horrible place this was! From the get go the waiter was such crabby old man- I asked for hoisin sauce he looked at me like I was asking for marinara sauce! Later to give it time I asked for some ice to cool the €9 euro bottle of water that was room temperature & he literally rolled his eyes at me- Seriously? Ok whatever- just bring the dim sum out and be done with it- a few plates of mediocre fare later he brings out what should have been the highlight- Sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf- we carefully unwrapped the steamy hot item only to find what looked like a massive dung with no discernible rice grains to speak of- just a big brown turd of mush- still I dissected it as supposedly it contained chicken- which at the very center was a dried up tasteless chicken wing- bone in and just GROSS! I called the crabby old man over and lied that while we enjoyed the other items that this was just inedible- thank you please retire it from the table- which he did- I felt bad for having returned something so I asked for another small plate of dim sum to make up for it- but when the bill came to my surprise he had charged me for the lotus wrapped pile of ... and so I said to him- I'm sorry but you forgot to remove this from my bill- and he insisted that he would not take it off my bill that I HAD TO PAY!  I was indignant at how utterly preposterous this was- I have rarely returned anything and when I have the service has been apologetic and settled quickly- the crab would not let up and the scene he was making in the restaurant had me on pins and needles- there's a price for dignity and it was obvious his was €6 euros! NEVER EAT HERE if you're in Hamburg! Try the Dim Sum Haus literally around the corner! Bon Appetit! Just NOT at the Mei Moon-
1,"It was not tasty.The menu on the card is nice, but the kumpir itself.. is small and less tasty. For this price you could find more tasty potatoes everywhere else.Compared with other Kumpir in Berlin or Istanbul, this is the worst.The salad and sauce was kind of interesting and it looked almost fresh. The shop itself looks clean."
1,"I'm giving Wasserschloss two stars because I love the building and location, but the food was not good and the service was really bad. My partner had the vegetarian pasta, which she hated and left unfinished -- there was no sauce on the pasta, so the dish wasn't integrated.  I had the nothing special currywurst, but I'd asked for ketchup and mayo and by the time I finally got it (after asking a couple of times) the pommes frites were cold. And the bill came late after several requests.  Come here for a beer and enjoy what it offers:  ambience."
2,"Bei derriesigen Auswahl an asiatischen Essensmöglichkeiten bietet dieser BOK imUnterscheid zu vielen anderen, auch derselben Kette, doch wirklich ein gutesNiveau. Essen und Preis stehen im korrekten Verhältnis, verstehe auch nichtdiesen Hype, dass in Deutschland immer alles so heiß gegessen werden muss.Gemüse ist frisch, Tofu hat Geschmack, und ich mag die Atmosphäre."
3,Great hidden but very busy spot.  Absolutely delicious coffee. Solid bagel sandwiches & delicious marzipan cruffin. Offer huge variety of coffees they roast on site so you can bring some delicious beans home. Only downside is it's often packed and hard to maneuver around or find a seat.
4,"Sudhang was a great dinner choice for our 1st night in Hamburg.  We visited in the 2nd weekend in December and it was bustling with booked Christmas parties.  Although we were lucky to get a table, ours was far too small and so there were lots of shuffling dishes around during the meal.  But the owner warned us of this in advance and my friend assured us that it was too good to pass up.  Definitely recommend a reservations as the place is small and cozy, and clearly very popular.  We went with the specials/set menu and the goat cheese soup was delicious, the monkfish main was succulent and juicy, and the shared dessert between the 4 of us was enough to satisfy everyone's sweet tooth.  The staff was friendly & helpful and recommended some excellent wine, as there was quite a large selection.  Inside is romantically dark and the vibe is relaxed and cool, and my friend who lives right around the corner frequents the place for the great food, atmosphere, and homey-feel to the place.  Definitely worth a visit for tourists & locals alike!"
4,"Let me preface this by writing that normally, I am not much of a zoo person. However, I was really impressed with Hamburg's Tropen Aquarium. I was amazed at the lemur exhibitthe lemurs jump on your shoulders, leap from ledge to ledge, and scurry around the floor. The zoo keeper in charge could tell them all apart and was clearly very experienced. While the lemurs were by far my favorite part of the aquarium, I also really liked the variety of fish and reptiles they had. I even got to see a live feeding of the sharks! You don't have to be a kid to be really wow'ed by this place."
2,"I stumbled in here on the end of a girls night out already one too many vino's... there was an entrance fee but we just pushed through anyways so I actually am unsure how much it was?! It was an 80""s night with all your favorite ""love-to-hate-but-secretly-i'm-a-80's-fan-too"" tracks ! People were in costume which added to the trashyness of it and there were plenty of lounges to park myself down on and take it all in. Fun!!"
4,"I believe this is one of the most beautiful views of Hamburg Hafen from a bar.  You really capture the beauty of not only the Harbor city but can see down the Elbe River for quite some distance. The entire Empire Hotel is chic, and the food is tasty and served with a bit of poshness as most trendy hotels usually incorporate into the overall experience.  The worst thing to discover with going to Lounge 20 Up is when a queue (or long line) develops to head upstairs to the bar area.  Either stand in line or enjoy a few cocktails at the hotel lobby level bar until the line dies down, then head upstairs.  The risk you run of not standing in the roped off line is that when you finally get upstairs, you might NOT easily find anywhere to sit, let alone stand on busier nights.   When it is crowded, you have little to no chance of actually getting close enough to the window to enjoy a city view, but if you finally manage to steal a table with a a view, the sight is gorgeous.. Floor to ceiling glass walls almost make you feel like you will fall.  If you are afraid of heights, your stomach gets a couple butterflies but you get over it pretty quick. Any tourist to Hamburg should come here just for the FREE view of the Harbor alone. What is not free, are the pricey cocktails!  I like to order the champagne mixed cocktails by the glass served in a flute, often with a gooseberry fruit garnish. Do not expect to dance here, it is mainly for cocktails and lounging, but since it is only a 10 minute walk to Reeperbahn, you can be at clubs, bars, other touristy attractions in no time.  It receives 5 Stars for the views of 20Up and the upscale trendy vibe of the hotel facilities and decor. Tip: There is a coat check but on busy nights, this is one of those establishments that frown a bit if you do not check your coat in and request to hold onto it.  You get a quick glance like, ""Oh, you want to hold onto your own jacket/coat?!"""
4,"Possibly one of the best falafel in Hamburg! Really tasty!! Nice chunky vegetables and quality food for only 3.5 Euros. It's a bargain and you can eat in too, sweet little mezzanine."
4,"Great customer service, cozy interior and excellent food. The food portions are big, so you will definitely not leave hungry.I had the Labskaos , which was delicious, and so were the pancakes I shared with my boyfriend. Totally recommended! 5/5 stars"
4,"Good quality and quantity, best sea food in town. But if you go there during busy hour you may need to wait for a while or need reservation"
4,"The best bar on Hamburger Berg- Rosis is similar to many of the other ""dive"" bars aufm Kiez but it has a special something going on for it which seperates it from the rest of the bars around here. Is is the drinks? Nah, an Astra here costs pretty much the same in every bar near the Reeperbahn. Just dont get caught drinking any other beer. Could it be the atmosphere? Maybe- the wood interior with paintings and lamps straight out of the 60s and 70s certainly lend this place some character. The foosball table and couch also add nice distractions when you dont want to dance. Oh, now that I mention it, its the dancing! People here just want to dance, dance, dance. The DJ on Thursday/weekends is likely spinning old soul 45s (think James Brown) and everyone just gets down, in an unpretentious way. The crowd here is totally not an ""Im here-to-be-seen"" scene. My stand-by when it comes to a night out aufm Kiez. Check it out."
0,"Worst place ever, the most not nice people gathered together and work there, if you wanna ruin your night and evening I totally recommend it."
4,"Very cozy place, somehow dark and homey in the evenings, with very nice and friendly staff!"
3,"I don't come to Germany for the coffee.  But I stopped by nord coast after hearing about it from a friend and was pleasantly surprised.They make both light roast and dark roast espresso.  I was surprised by this, and inquired with the owner as to why, and he responded that most Germans do not drink anything other than dark roast.  Him and I wink at each other and acknowledge that light roast is where all the flavor and complexity is really at.  I know German culture takes time to adapt.  GERMAN PEOPLE IF YOU'RE READING THIS -- try the light roast it will not harm you.The food is great.  My favorite breakfast I've had so far is the poached egg with pesto, pomegranate, and spinach.  The waffles are pretty good too, with fruit and whipped cream.If you've tried the espresso, then it's worth trying the coffee.  They've got some preparation techniques that are uniquely German (I forget the name but ask one of the folks working there).  I tried one and it was really good.Other highlights: the place is on the canal and has a nice view.  In addition, they are pretty chill so you might wait for your coffee sometimes.  I pestered the staff with a ton of questions and they were nice enough to answer all of them!"
3,"I passed this café a hundred times, but now I made it inside! And here you go:Service: Very cute. And friendly and quick. I just do not know if she would have been able to speak German as well. Pancakes with maple syrup: Just great! Verrrrry yummy. Way too much, but as it was that yummy there was no way not to eat up everything..Ambiance: Not overwhelming, but the pancakes make up for it, promise. Remarkable (and surely a matter of taste): A hotchpotch of very colorful cups. Definitively worth a try.  : )"
2,"Been here a bunch of times at this point. I always get the Döner Teller to go but most of my colleagues get the regular Durum Döner. One way or another, the fresh bread in this place is super tasty. The meat is also usually quite good. Unfortunately, the service here is extremely hectic and not at all customer friendly. Actually super annoying is the process of ordering. You pay, get a ticket and wait. No one really makes much of an effort to find out what you want and if full at lunch, it's chaotic. Further, the place is a dive. Each of the many guys behind the counter is covered in grease stains and sweat. Hand washing seems to be a non-issue and I am concerned about these guys touching my food. Finally, the restaurant itself is filthy. It's not inviting from the outside and the interior is quite repulsive. In summary, the food is actually tasty and the bread is the best part. Unfortunately, you have to risk food poisoning when eating here. I do admit at times I say f""§k it and just go for broke. You only live once! :-)"
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (4/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
2,Very simple Asian imbis with afordable prices. You can eat and drink well for under 7EUR. Staff is quite friendly but if you are one of those people who can't stand spicy food than this place is not reccomendable. Almost everything there is made of chilli.
3,On the way into Deichgraf there is an inconspicuous little photo on a table in the hallway. If you stop to look at it you'll notice that it's a photo of Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder in the restaurant! I guess that means this place is well regarded. The restaurant is certainly well decorated with antique furniture and original paintings. THe prices are medium-high rather than mega-expensive. Myself and two friends had lunch here for EUR30. I don't know what my meal was called but it was delicious and being the lunch special was only EUR8.80.
1,"Great atmosphere, and they're very accommodating.   I ordered Nackensteak, and it was terrible, all tough and mostly gristle.  Not much to eat out of eat, but it was my first time eating Nackensteak, so maybe it's supposed to be like that.  I went with a large group and they were able to accommodate us all sitting together.  The salad I had was good."
2,"Was there the other day for a drink on a Friday night. Place was packed and we waited that the door for the hostess to get to us (there were still two other tables in front of my buddy and me). While listening to the conversation of those guests we inevitably noticed that the restaurant was full and only waiting for bar seats were still free... which was fine with us as we wanted to have drinks only anyways! Ended up in front of the hostess and she said to us, 'We do not have tables anymore, unless you have a reservations!'. I was a bit stunned by that 'welcome' as it was not really what I expected and said that bar seats would be fine! Her face immediately cleared up and she was visually relieved and we were lead to the bar. Place was indeed packed, so def great atmosphere with good music (a little too loud as we need to shout...) and service at the bar was fast and pleasant. I must agree though with other comments that prices are quite high... 4 drinks (2 bottle beers and two alcohol free beers) total bill of 25 EUR I think the most expensive beer I so far had in Hamburg! Anyways am sure that things will get smoother sooner or later, am not sure though prices gonna become more moderate. Will give it another try sometime on one of my next visits."
4,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here during our stay in Hamburg and I can safely say it was the best meal of my life. Armando was incredibly friendly and accommodating (since I'm a vegetarian.) Each of the four courses was better than the last, and the wine pairing was excellent. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys food. Wonderful, wonderful experience!"
4,"This is a good chinese place!The food is premium quality. We were 4 persons so we took the Tsingtao Menu.It consisted of a soup, springrolls, duck, beef, chicken and lamb and of course rice à gogo! Everything was delicious. We were sat at a table with a rotating part in the middle, so we were able to pass around the plates without making a mess! The restaurant is not cheap but its worth every penny"
4,Fisch & co. serve up tasty fresh fish with multiple choices. You can eat inside or outside. It has a really rustic feel and is on the oldest street in Hamburg. The staff is friendly and prices are good.
0,"Can't comment on quality of food , since we couldn't get paid the rude and unreasonable hostess who for whatever reason requested level of documents as if we crossing country borders. Vaccine proof, USA identification and a picture of passport apparently is not enough to dine in this establishment. She also requested our home address and original passport. And proceeded to lie in our face that no restaurant in Germany would accept us without original passport. We easily got in at a pub on next block."
3,"If it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd probably go to Pony Bar pretty often. It's a reasonably priced, cool little bar. Unfortunately it's miles away, and there's about 50 good bars in between it and me :)"
3,"The ice cream shop ""Eiskantine"" offers a small choice of ice cream flavors. The flavors include very common flavors like vanilla and chocolate as well as special flavors like chocolate-mint. The ice cream tasted very good. The shop has its own interesting style and the staff is very nice."
3,"We had a good experience at this restaurant. My husband had the original LABSKAUS and really liked it, I had SCHNITZELS with lemon and ate it all, it was delicious. Service was excellent and in English! The atmosphere was friendly and family oriented, we do recommend this place."
3,"If you're looking for something a little more upscale that won't break the bank, this is definitely a great spot to go. Was here for a company outing dinner and really enjoyed it. The menu is quite diverse and they have an excellent selection of Flammkuechen, fish dishes and burgers. There's definitely something on the menu for everyone. I had the ""Fisch Platte"" that was a whitefish, salmon and shrimp scampi (unfortuately cold) -- came with Bratkartoffeln and a small salad. Huge portion but all of it very tasty. A colleague got a burger and he also enjoyed this. It's an old warehouse type space renovated with a large dining hall and smaller rooms off to the sides, seems like a great place for a group to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. To top it off, there is a real ""Trude"" in the back lawn! Massive!"
4,This place was absolutely amazing! The line was pretty long so I highly recommend getting your tickets online. The buffet had decent food and the prices were reasonable.
2,"We ordered number 25 and 32. The sauce of number 25 was good and the nuggets were ok, but for 11 € it's overpriced and not worth it. The 32 dish was ok. When to skip this place: 1) If you are asian and used to asian food, skip this place. It's a classy germanized asian food 2) This might sound like the loving hut chain you think you know from the US. It's not! None of the dishes are the same. Just the name and logo looks the same 3) the service is not about making you feel welcomed or comfortable. It's about making sure you get your food lol. Feels very chaotic and rushed. Would I come again. Nope. Do I regret coming here. Nope, it's good to know that loving hut doesn't equal loving hut. It's not like McDonald's where you can expect to be able to order a Big Mac."
3,"This is close to a hidden gem. Tiny fish shop with a fair sized menu. When you place your order, it is immediately cooked so always fresh. Unfortunately this means that the place smells fishy; literally. The food is great though. I had the mixed teller that has several fish and potatoes. Delicious! My friend had the fish and chips. While the fish is definitely lacking, the chips were proper British!"
4,"Beautiful, spacious restaurant in the basement of Hamburg's historic city hall building. Unlike most city hall restaurants in Germany, this one is relatively fancy with excellent service and great food and drinks. Compared to other restaurants of its class in Hamburg it is downright cheap. The food is mostly modern interpretations of traditional Hamburg and North German dishes. Great place to take a date!"
3,I really liked the cherry chocolate gelato.
3,"We did the English tour at 10am today, was great and very entertaining. Most was in English so it was easy to understand (a couple of things were in German but it didn't take away from the experience). There were a few laughs, a few screams and all out fun. If you don't speak German it's essential that you book in for one of the English tours.Only negative was the fun photo at the beginning didn't work and it took almost halfan hour for us to get another one taken"
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (3.5/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
3,"I really enjoyed this, geeky as it may be. There's zero hype, and not much education happening. Basically, you're walking on your own through a good portion of a real submarine, free to poke and prod. If that appeals to you, have at it! But take it from me, watch your head. The doors are low at the top, and high at the bottom, and generally have pipes just where you want to stand up after passing through. (Probably not a good outing for a first date.)"
2,"This is a traditional place in Hamburg which has been around forever. I've been here multiple times over the years but having just watched the EM final there last night, it was time to write something. It's basically a kiosk turned into a restaurant. It's still has the shabby flair but they've gone upmarket a bit adding things like wine, shrimp, salads to the menu. I don't know how little they used to serve way back when but it's no longer just beer and fries. Surprisingly enough, I had the beer and fried and they were really good. I haven't ever eaten anything else here and it's not gourmet or anywhere near it. If you are up for a classic beach club in Hamburg, live nearby and can get here easily (which is not the case when coming from the other side of town) and the sun is out or it's a warm evening, definitely stop in. Plus, as someone already wrote in the German section the crowd is also becoming a bit more upscale again. This place went a bit down-scale over the years but I believe management is doing it's best to get out of that hole and attract hipper people. If that's a good thing, I don't know!"
3,"I visit green lovers every few weeks for a salad lunch. They have a handful of predetermined salad recipes to choose from, or you can choose your own adventure with several dozen salad toppings available. They also serve some soups and curries, and a handful of sandwich options. My favorite salad is the Nordisch by Nature, which includes cucumbers, radishes, spring onions, and smoked salmon over lettuce, with a creamy yogurt dressing and a sprinkle of mustard sauce. I've also tried the chicken sesame salad, which was okay but not great. All of the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared, and the staff is friendly. If you get there at peak lunch time (12:30-1:00), there will probably be a queue of 5-10 people waiting to place their orders, but things move pretty quickly, and you can order salads to eat in or take away."
4,"An absolutely wonderful experience. I hadn't expected much and was really overwhelmed by the amount of detail in the tableaus. There really is something for all ages in the Mini Wunderland, and my whole family spent a lot of time marveling over the beautiful landscapes. I recommend booking an early time-slot; it only gets more crowded during the day. Take the guided tour and get behind the scenes. It's worth the €15!If you're head is filled up after a few hours, you can get a stamp on your hand and return later in the day. There's always more to explore!"
3,Really good wholesome meal. Plenty of home grown German options to choose from. Always feel slightly uncomfortable with the staff- may be my issue since I don't speak fluent German. Sit where you want which is nice. Nice spacious restaurant and they have their own beer selection.
4,"We both ordered a ""Mars Menu"": (I) pulpo salad (II) chicken with mashed potatoes (III) vanilla ice-cream with strawberries. All for Euro 38 per person. It was excellent and the portions were quite large. We sat at the bar and the service was very professional and friendly. The noise level was high but this well reflected the good atmosphere of the staff and guests. We will certainly return here again in the future."
4,One of the most beautiful places in this wonderful city.
4,"This is the COOLEST museum/exhibit that I have EVER SEEN!  When you think you are going to visit a tiny recreation of the world via trains...it is even better and bigger than that.  I mean, this guy and his team have thought of everything!!!  The lights go down for nighttime and the sceneries interact with you/change depending on the time of day, etc.  It is so hard to explain the magic of this place.  There are generally lines but so worth the wait.  Block off some time for this one.  This is not a place you want to pop in a run through.  The details are crazy cool and necessitate a lengthier visit.  I wish I could go back and share this with so many of my friends and family members but it is sooo far away for me.  If you are reading this and considering a visit, do it!  You will not be disappointed, but rather left in awe by the creativeness of it all."
4,"Everytime i walk through the weidenallee i see L'incontro and say to myself, i should try that place out.and i finally have!when i got there around 7 pm, the place was already full, and we got one of the last 2 available tables. the place was full all through out the evening, with more than half of the tables 'reserved'. the food is really good.I highly advise you to try the gnocchi with 'maronen' ... its a delight. L'incontro is a cute little italian restaurant, its cozy, could be romantic if you are in the mood.I think reservation would be preferable although not required. All in all, the weidenallee is a nice change from schanze (and not too far away), if you are looking for something for the older crowd"
3,"Swedish restaurants are pretty rare, so I guess this one goes all in on being Swedish. First of all its logo is some kind of a Dala horse, a symbol of Sweden. And inside you have Lilla Åland chairs (well, fake replicas most likely), probably the most popular chair design from Sweden. So the atmosphere and interior makes me feel like I'm at home.I have only tried the meatballs here, and I like them. If you want a heavy meal and like potatoes, I think you'll like this place and its food too."
3,"Had a late lunch here with family after an appointment at UKE. Service was great and we ordered a biryani, baingan bharta and Punjabi paneer. All three items were very delicious. I will go there again on a special occasion."
2,"I was in Hamburg for work and was brought here by a local who seemed to eat there regularly. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was what you expect from an expensive Italian Restaurant. One weird thing was the only English menu on offer was on a giant chalk board. A waiter brought it round and we had to choose there and then. It was different, but fine and had no negative impact on our experience. The food I chose was very good. I had Dover sole that was really tasty and then at the end we shared a huge plate with one of each of their desserts in it. Again it was very nice. If you like Italian food then this place will probably appeal to you. Just be aware it was also on the pricey side."
3,"I'm an Asian. Their Chinese food of course is a bit German style for me but for German it is the best what they can have with a very very good price, especially with the growing kids, they can have as much as they can. After the extension of the restaurant, the sittings area even bigger and more comfortable, and also they provide some outside sittings too."
4,"The food is so good , so tasty. Location is not so far from center , you can take bus or train to get there. Services are friendly , they gave you recommendations when you didnt know what to choose. Must-have-to-go restaurent when you are in Hamburg."
4,"Probably the most comfy bar in the Sternschanze area. It is crammed with couches, a smoking area is in the basement.ZIII has an adequate amount of drinks on the menu, but no food. That shouldn't be a problem, the Sternschanze is bustling with places to eat.Prices are average and below, drinks are always great.The barmaids seem to be chosen by their great looks and their permanent good mood.English is spoken."
4,"So I have had some good Italian meals and last night we came here as a work group and some visitors from out of town. This experience was pretty special.We all went for the taster menu and the whole thing was just fantastic.15 year old super viscous Balsamic vinegar, extra first pressed Sicilian olive oil, angel hair spaghetti with truffles, carpaccio of smoked tunafish, melt in the mouth Tiramisu great wine, and really good service.A really good place to enjoy incredible Sicilian Italian food outside on a warm evening. Not the cheapest, but one of the best."
4,"Really liked the vibe, the service was fast. Sushi - amazing, great choices and varieties. The only not so good thing for me was the tempura, it wasnt hot and really greasy. Otherwise- definitely a great place to come on a Friday night!"
2,"Having been to the original location in Munich, the Hamburg location was a little disappointing.  Service was very slow and staff was really much less interactive with our table.  Food is not bad, there certainly weren't any surprises, but I felt the food at the Munich location was a step above what we had in Hamburg.  If you are in Germany and will not have a chance to hit up the location in Munich, its certainly a place to try if you have a few days, but I would honestly recommend another location for good local German food.  This location is definitely for tourists from outside of Germany."
4,"An excellent Indian cafe a short walk from the Hauptbahnhof. Don't expect nice table cloths and stylish service but the food is great. Also, check out their Indian sweets with a sugar content so high it should be illegal. It's strange that some if the best Asian cuisine is served in little cafés like this."
3,"Nice location, stick to details and definitely worth to visit. I think the entrance is all little bit high, but at he end of the day, u should visit it, when u are in Hamburg"
2,"Service is average and the beer is kind of a dissapointment.  Neat location on a canal. Hard to explain the beer;  I had their copper lager which is almost a dunkel but doesn't get to the richness of a dunker, and lacks something if it's trying to be closer to an altbier. The summer lager I had was full of all kinds of spices like coriander, but it was just kind of cloying in flavor.Had the flatbread pizzas, which were great; vegetarian options are here, and you can make some stuff vegan."
3,Recently vastly improved Italian restaurant. Al fresco dining at a reasonable price.
3,"Apparently, Hamburg does have a beach. It's just hiding in the tiki bars.In all seriousness, it's a relaxing place. Chill out with a Mai Tai, get your butt in a lounge chair, take your shoes off and get them into that sand. On a sunny day, just ignore the container ships going by and you've got yourself an oasis."
2,"This is just another Asian in the line of those which are pretty far from original Asian food. Vegetable is not cooked enough, most of the dishes are way to spicy and place is mostly empty which makes it even more unatractive. Service staff is good but that's about it."
1,"I'm sure this is a nice place to grab a coffee or sandwich - at least it looks nice - but for me, it was one great disappointment.- The people working pretented to not understand a single word of my English and if they did, they answered in German. They also didn't look at me when talking to me and I basically didn't feel welcome at all.- The breakfast plate I had been so extremely looking forward to ever since I saw the photos both here on Yelp and on Instagram wasn't mentioned on the menu, and when I asked for it I was told that that's only for special occassions or special people (!).+ The caffè latte and little yoghurt bowl with granola I ended up with tasted very good.So Hej papa deserves more than one star because of the food, the location and the cute name ;), but I would never ever go there again. Although, if they'd offer me that breakfast plate.........."
3,Greek food for the soul ;)im not Greek but i really liked the food and appetizer here.the owner is supper friendly and gave us very good tips on selecting different dishes. :)
4,"Came here with my (admittedly meat-loving and very skeptic) boyfriend and we both really liked it! We had the ""cheese"" baked nachos to start and liked it a lot. We also both really enjoyed our main dishes - I had the mr. Bean burrito and my boyfriend the Vitaly burger with the ""beyond meat"" patty. So good! I also tried a bit of the burger patty and was shocked that it's vegan as it tastes exactly like meat. This place is good enough to impress even your meat-loving friends. Give it a try!"
4,Amazing food made fresh. The aroma alone from the outside is enough to attract people to this restaurant. That's how my wife and I ended up here and did not regret it. I'll come back again for sure.
3,"Luigis is a quite nice italian restaurant in the quater Neustadt, also calles portuguese quater. The pizzas are like the pizzas in Italy. The pizza toppings are from very good quality and the various daily menu offers always nice new and traditional pizzas. The pasta is also original italian style.The pizzas are big and crispy. Their quality is excellent and you will not find easy a pizza backery like this in Hamburg.If you want to visit Luigis at the evening, you should better have an reservation. Its always difficult to get a table at the evenings. I can only give this restaurant five stars because of the staff. The staff is italian, but they are always a little bit craggy. But the service is fast and good.I recommend this restaurant for a quick but good lunch or dinner for families and groups, but not for a rendevous."
4,This place was humming on a Wednesday night. Luckily we had made reservations. Parking in the area was a nightmare. Better use public transportation. But it was worse it. We did had to wait some time to get the attention of the waiter. Staff was nice and courteous. Will definitely come again.
4,Pretty good authentic Chinese restaurant not far from the water and the piers. I felt like it was in a quieter part of town as it was in the opposite direction of most of the popular/touristy areas. Decent sized restaurant and our group went at the perfect time. It was mid day during the week and it was not busy at all. We sat at a table with a lazy suzy which is great for groups so everyone can share. The food was good and it was authentic. There were a few European twists but that is to be expected. I had the fried rice and a brisket noodle soup. Everyone shared our dishes as well and everything that I tried was good.
0,"After a great experience the previous night at the excellent Hof Brauhaus we decided to give this place a try on Saturday night as it was just around the corner from my Mums hotel. I'd had lunch there before and thought it might be just the thing.What a huge disappointment! The service was friendly and helpful, but of the three main dishes we ordered were all well below par. The Wiener Schnitzel was burnt, my pork medallions were over cooked, the baked potato with chicken was likewise incinerated.I would never return there sad because it's in a great position!Beer lovers note: Although this place bills itself as a brewery, there seems little evidence of this taking place, although there are copper tanks in evidence. I tried a Dunkle and was very unimpressed."
4,Fantastic fantastic fantastic place to see for kids of all ages. We have been 3 times now and every time we discover something new. Italy is still under construction and I can't wait to come back next year to see it completed!!! It's a don't miss when you are in Hamburg!!!
3,I've been dying to go back ever since I tried Kuchnia. Such a cozy atmosphere with a great selection of cocktails and wine and the pierogis were all so delicious.
4,"Cafe Mimosa is a great little St. Pauli breakfast spot. There are two main options; cheese & meat or lots of cheese and both are great. The cheese breakfast comes with brie, goats cheese, mozzarella with tomato & balsamic vinegar, cream cheese, some other cheese, grapes, butter, jam, two slices of homemade bread, a bun and a coffee. Basically everything on the plate is of the highest quality, and they give you the perfect amount, so that you'll finish everything, but not want more. The cheese & meat option is the same except you swap the goats cheese & mozzarella for palma ham and some good quality salami. Great value at EUR6."
3,"Gotta have a hamburger in Hamburg! We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar without a reservation and the place was absolutely packed the whole time. Heed the warning in the menu: this burger truly takes its damn time. We waited almost AN HOUR to receive food after ordering. Strangely, other people sitting at the bar got their food at the same time even though they arrived 30 minutes after us. That's the only reason the Bird doesn't get 5 stars. However, the servers were nice and the beers are big and they serve decent cider as well, so that took up our time. When we actually got the burger, I was ravenous. I'm happy to say that it was delicious and juicy and the HUGE medium rare patty was more like rare; very pink inside! I was in meaty bliss for the next 20 minutes. I opted for the Ghetto Deluxe with an egg and was about to order fries as well but our server kindly stopped me, bringing my attention to the fact that each burger comes with fries. And it is a lot of fries! They are crispy outside and creamy inside. And I was skeptical about using an english muffin for a bun but it worked out very well; keeping the burger structurally intact while soaking up all the yolk and meatjuice in the nooks and crannies. Also appreciated is the fact that they put the condiments right in front of you, and they have Tapatio! I don't like it when restaurants give me a tiny container of ketchup with my food.. I know it is a stereotype that Americans love ketchup but I'm afraid I have to propagate it; give me my damn ketchup. This is an excellent burger; one of the better ones that I've had the pleasure of eating in my lifetime. However, be prepared for a LONG wait and don't forget to bring cash."
4,"On an early December Sunday,I was fortunate to appreciate this art museum's splendid collection of Renaissance Period paintings by German and Netherlandish painters.German painters with fine Late Gothic and Renaissance Period paintings at this art museum included: Bertram Von Minden(""Altarpiece from ""Harvestehude""),Hinrik Funhof (""Virgin in Robe Decorated With Ears of Corn""),Master Francke((""Christ As Man of Sorrows""),Hans Burgmair the Elder(""Agony in Garden""),Hans Schaufelein(""Nativity"")Barthel Beham(""Vanitas""),Martin Schaffner(""Epitaph of Sebastian Welling""),Lucas Cranach the Elder(""Charity"") and Franz Zimmerman(""Lucretia""),among others.Netherlandish painters from the Renaissance Period with quality paintings included;Marcellis Coffermans,Jan Massys(""Flora"")Jan Provost(""Last Judgement""),Jan Gossaert(""Crucifixion""),and Hans Van Cleve the Third(""Tower of Babel""),among others.Although German and Netherlandish Renaissance Period paintings are emphasized at this art museum,I also saw fine Renaissance Period Italian paintings by Francesco Francia(""Virgin and Child Holding Globe""),Sebastiano di Bartolo Mainardi(""Virgin and Child with John the Baptist""),and Paris Bordone(""Fountain of Bathsheba"").The Kunsthalle's collection of Italian Art is relatively small in comparison to their German,Netherlandish,Dutch,and French paintings.I also appreciated the way the works of Art were arranged,the labeling of works of Art in English for the benefit of foreign visitors,and the helpfulness of its staff."
1,"I have been at Casa Rita for lunch with some colleagues.First of all, I'm not sure why somebody would define this bistro as ""Italian"". Yes they do have a selection of different type of pasta dishes but I would find it difficult to define any of them Italian.They have a wide selection of food to make a personalised antipasto, but I cannot judge it since I haven't tried it.The bread looked good and tasted great; I cannot say the same for the pasta (we ordered three types) which was generally overcooked and tasteless.Since I wouldn't visit it again I will give it 2 stars."
3,"The food of Tatı was good. Just some pity thinks are,  that they making the crepes with Emmentaler. Normally use should be e.g. Morbie. Second is that I couldn't enjoy my crepes so much. It wasn't like a normal Bretagne crepes all in one. On my crepes all ingredients was separate,  that made it hard to eat. The quiche was really good."
3,"Went there for lunch with some colleagues and we had the daily special. It's 2 course meal and a drink.The 2 courses were crepes , one was savory and one was sweet. It was delicious and costed just 8.40 Euro.Only bad thing: I'm still a little bit hungry."
3,"Concept of this place is great and design too.It made like real apartment, if a real apartment was with table football,bar and filled with sofas:D +they have literature and live music evenings every first and third wednesday.-Not so special drink menu.Also once my glass of wine was filled from 3 bottle leftoversphe:( Thats why only 4 stars.Otherwise this place is great."
3,"What a night! Went with a group of 11 and were treated to a tapas style meal selected by the owner which included four flavourful seafood courses: sea bass, sword fish, shrimp flambé and Canadian halibut.  A truly authentic Portuguese dining experience including a beautiful acoustic serenade throughout our meal.  Highly recommend."
2,"This place is odd to visit as an Englishman. It reminds you that there are many brands of 'Germany' in GermanyIt's a great big bavarian themed beer hall  complete with beer wenches, Steins and oompah bandA race to get get full to the gills with masses or beer, German food then loudly sing well known German songs.When I was there, I joined two of the waiting staff as we watched a little mouse scuttle between two tables and the bar to run behind one of the service tables. They looked at each other and went about their business. So not a place to impress anyone, but as the Hofbrauhaus in Hamburg it does what it says on the tin. I'd come again to watch Football or for a stag do, but that's about it."
0,"Arrived at 7:30pm Saturday with family of 4.  Noticed about 4 tables seated with local Germans.  Despite plenty of empty tables available, we were told ""restaurant is full""...apparently Americans are not welcomed here.  Racism at its worst in a progressive metropolitan area"
3,"Went here with someone who had already been there once. I am impressed. Reminded me of the restaurant in the Alsterhaus where you can pick your own food (raw) and have it prepared in front of you. The selection at Copper House is much more extensive and the price is right if you are hungry. I truly enjoyed the food as you can have it made exactly as you wish with the specific sauces you choose yourself. Service is also super nice and I never felt like anything lacked. They didn't bother us when we didn't want to be bothered but were right there as soon as you needed them. Drinks were good as well. Finally, I didn't really miss a large dessert selection as I was already so full from the three plates I had prepared, mostly with fish and vegetables. One minus point is that I am getting somewhat tired of this design style. It looks like every other designer place. It's quite nice so don't get me wrong. It's just not different."
3,"Fantastic location and view, great drinks and  friendly staff. Go here on a weekday to skip the que and have more space. Viel Spaß!"
4,"A very good place for fresh see food such as lobster, scampi, service is quite good as well because they offer kids the color pencils for drawing during waiting for food."
3,We arrived Hamburg at noon and decide to get some burgers before going to the office. This place is pretty close to the city hall and rated well.I ordered the steak burger and fries and they both taste good. But the place is very hard to find since it's located in a food court in a shopping mall.
4,"Wonderful meal. Incredible service. Charming ambiance even the clientele looked hand picked for this place. Family nights out, fancy dinner dates, groups of friends catching up over a long French dinner. All represented tonight. I had the snails to start. (They are not in shells. They come in a hot pot pre stewed) it's was wonderful if a tad salty. Scampi provencal for the main was perfect. I wiped the sauce with extra bread. And the standout of the evening for me, the desert (who would have thought it, not I) the apple pancake soaked in a very lightly sweet liquor and Caramelized sugar on top. Not sure what wine I was served but it was great too."
2,"Yes this is a strange one. This restaurant benefits from being in the middle of one of the busiest restaurant areas in Hamburg. So it's more or less always going to be pretty busy. So we were very grateful when we found a table here without having booked. Four adults and 2 kids, it was great, especially when they asked another table to shift off their place for us. Then we watched all night as they moved people around the place all night as new people arrived. I haven't seen that before! It was also freezing outside, but boiing inside, and every time the door opened (which was a lot) we all got a blast of icy air! Overall it wasn't bad, the food was OK, then we had a little dance at the end when we were told they didn't take credit cards but then when I pulled out my Qype wallet, hey presto all of sudden they did! Which was very strange!"
3,"Barley & Malt is an Irish pub in the center of Hamburg at the Deichstraße close to the building where the great fire started in 1842. The street is very nice and it is possible to sit outside in the summer. The interior and the decoration are similar to most Irish pubs I have been to. The TV screens show football, rugby or cricket.  The pub offers several snacks and small dishes. I only tried the Nachos which tasted good.To access the pub you need to go up some stairs."
1,"I think superchristine sums it up really. It is a great place for mid-30's single smokers who like to grind! It's not a great place (esp. upstairs) if you don't smoke, because you won't be able to enter without breathing equipment, and I don't even mind smoking! On a par with mutter there. On the plus side, it does have a nice BBQ and beer garden out back, and it's a bit off the beaten track, still, I don't really go here anymore."
4,Great place. Good ramen. lots of variety. May have to wait for about 20 mins to get in
4,"For the buffet: Fried chicken is super, also the black pepper beef is really tasty. Sushi is OK-ish. Always so crouded at noon, because it sits inside a company campus. Service is really fast. The restaurant is bright and big, but a little bit loud."
4,"Tasty food. I've been in Europe for 2 months and this was my first burger since being here... I was very pleased! I had the BBQ burger and I would definitely recommend it! I got the menu, which ended up being a bit too much food for me, but it was worth the price."
4,This place is great.  Fantastic fresh fish from four oceans.  We sat outside and were entertained by Franco.  I would highly recommend Casa Franco Caramba.
4,"Found this place on yelp and was very excited to get vegan dinner here! The staff was friendly, the food delicious and the atmosphere was very warm and nice! I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend a nice evening and enjoy great vegan or vegetarian dishes."
2,"I'm glad I went, but I also wish I spent more time on the Reeperbahn during my stay in Hamburg, and this is what I would cut out. It was a fun experience that's not too far away from other things you'll probably want to see, but it wasn't as educational or informative as I thought it would be.I went alone, and ended up being the only person on the submarine for most of my time down there. I was creeped out a lot more than I thought - it's a really tight and dark space with terrible gas fume smells. There's a loud engine room, but the rest of the space has fake sonar ping audio being piped in. There's little camera lenses cut into various walls so the people in the office can watch you as you browse through, but other than that, you're free to go at your own pace - provided there's enough room for others to squeeze by. Also, I'm really hoping all the white fibrous insulation isn't asbestos.All the original signage and instruments are in Russian (which is awesome) and there's some English signs showing what rooms were used for. Don't go if you have any mobility issues, you will be climbing up and through awkward holes.If you're looking for something nearby that might be more interesting, I thought the Alter Elbtunnel that goes under the river with a massive elevator for cars was pretty exciting."
3,"Froindlichst is an all-vegan restaurant in Winterhude with a variety of foods including burgers, pizza, burritos, and salads. There's also a full coffee and tea menu, a few cakes, and an ice cream section.I had the ""Den Burger"", which is some sort of play on words that escapes my feeble German. It's a lentil patty on a bun with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, ketchup, and some kind of basil cream. It comes served with too few sweet potato fries, and an extra little plate of the basil cream. The burger itself is quite large and filling, and actually pretty tasty. The condiments seemed like too much at first, but when you realize how dense and large the patty is, you're glad to have something to dip it in. The fries are pretty fantastic, but again, there aren't enough of them.To say I was apprehensive about trying Froindlichst would be an understatement. Aside from being a vegan restaurant (a category I mostly avoid), there were a few warning signs. First, my wife had made a reservation online, but when we arrived there wasn't a table set aside for us. Fortunately, there were plenty of empty tables, but this seemed like an opportunity for disappointment. Second, the service was perfectly friendly, but when we placed our order, the sound of juicy burgers hitting the grill didn't exactly emanate from the kitchen. Laid back, they are. Fortunately, all's well that ends well, and at the end of the day, I left satisfied and pleasantly surprised."
4,"Very good food, amazing view, comfortable atmosphere  the service was not too short and not too long, perfect to spend a relaxed evening enjoying Italian food"
2,"We ordered 2 Pho, 1 with beef, 1 with chicken. It wasn't bad but there was no ingredients that we could put ourselves in the soup... Normally, you can put coriander, soja beans and squeeze lime yourself which is part of the fun.Their mango-coconut milkshake was delicious though!"
0,"Did this Place shut down ? I can not reach anyone by Phone ( the Number you have dialed is unavailable ""040 43183050"" and the Website ist down and Domain for Sale !Does anyone know more about this ?"
3,Probably my fav burger joint in Hamburg. However every time I visit is not consistent.  Sometimes the fries are fresh sometimes there not. I always get the poutine because I am canadian and it's nostalgic. It def one of the best poutines I've had except the gravy is never hot. A poutine should be served piping hot so the cheese curds melt into the gravy!
4,Very cool place. Entrance is 10 euros (less for children). It was very interesting seeing all the cars (and the progression of the car through history). I would definitely recommend doing this. The staff was also very helpful and were able to speak English.There is also a small café and gift shop.
4,Perfekt und sehr lecker!
4,"Yelp didn't let us down on our trip to Hamburg, I had read about this place before and was looking forward to trying and I wasn't disappointed! All the tables come with individual tablets to pop up in the middle of table which makes ordering easy especially when your German is less than wunderbar! You select your burger/pulled meat and the type of bun you want and a side. I opted for pulled pork in a sesame bun with amazing thin sliced potatoes. It was delicious! The food was fresh, fast and used good ingredients. The staff were great and this place kicked off a great trip."
3,We went here for the second time. It is a great experience to walk through the rooms with a guide who explains the life as a blind person. You walk through different rooms and experience the life as a blind person. At the end you can buy something at a dark bar. It is a very special museum.
4,"wow, mein Premier vom Afghanischen Essen, hier am Sonntag Mittag am Steindamm. lecker! alles frisch. Jasmintee mit Teeblätter & Jasminblüten.SEHR zu Empfehlen! Probiere es mal aus, und geniese diese tolle Cuisine. Bon Appetit!"
3,"The french name and ""Cuisine Fine"" claim makes it sound like it's a fine-dining restaurant, which it actually isn't. But it doesn't matter, because the food is actually delicious and the service is friendly.We had a little bump at the beginning where it took them almost 30min to get us the drinks, but they were apologetic enough for it, even got us a drink on the house which is very rare in German restaurants where the service is usually terrible.A 3-course menu (goat cheese salad, burger with fries and creme brulée) costs 27€ which is very fair. The drinks are also good."
3,"Netter, kleiner Laden. Eigentlich super, jedoch konnte ich kein Hähnchen probieren, da gerade kein fertig war. Die Currywurst als Ersatz war ok, könnte jedoch etwas schärfer sein.Werde wohl versuchen eines dieser legendären Hähnchen zu bekommen."
3,Excellent pizza and lunch special combination! I ordered the vegitarian pizza and it was absolutely delicious and only 4euro. I was really suprized with the quality and the size of the pizza. The service was super quick too!
4,"OMG, the best Chinese food ever. They have a Chinese menu, and the food there is absolutely authentic. We ordered boiled spicy beef and sour bean with minced pork. It is soooo tasty that I want to lick the dish. The restaurant is not big. We came in 7pm on Sunday, and it was already full. We wait about 20 mins to get a table. And the food didn't disappoint us. I have also ordered several take-away here. The food is also great. Definitely recommend it to others."
4,"My new favorite Falafel place!!! I love it when i get so many freebiesi ordered the (number 23) Chicken Shawarma, and while i was waiting for my order, i got a Date-cookie, then a sesame cookie.. and then i got a free falafel! The owner is from Iraq and quite friendlyit did help that we have the same mother language, but stillHe had also offered the previous 2 customers the sesame cookie although they couldnt speak a word of arabic (excluding falafel and hummus). The chicken shawarma tasted really good... i eat everything if its immersed in hummus... A sandwich costs between 3EUR50 and 4EUR pretty fair for the size of the sandwich ur getting..."
1,"Recommended by many in Hamburg for some strange reason.  If at one point this was a top restaurant, those days are gone. Passable Italian food torpedoed by indifferent, insufferable, lackadaisical service. Do not want to be unfair to the kitchen, even if the food is not all that either, but the main topic of conversation between me and my dinner partner was the poor experience at Gallo Nero.  They do have cute empty bottles of wine lining the walls."
2,"I ordered a plate of classic salad with rainbow bell peppers (triple color mix), tomato, grapes and extra avocado for €7.90 (which is equal to US $9.00). Look at the pictures and make up your mind, how fresh(!) their components are. As I tried to ask for explanation, instead of an apology I received an unacceptable answer. The lady at the salad bar was struggling to justify the reason why the avocado slices were brownish and mushy. She stated that when they cut them fresh this morning the avocados looked normal, we're talking from 14 hours later!!! What a great answer, another reason not to return, not to mention that they don't have sanitary service, no chance to wash your hands either."
4,"This is so far the best place to eat in Hamburg. Great location. Excellent food. Really the best. Loved herrings, all different kinds of potato dishes. Beer and Schnitzel also. Cute decors."
4,"if you visit hamburg, you must go to atlantik fisch! its definitely one of the best places in town to buy raw fish or to eat prepared fish. they offer delicious shells, salmon or backfischbrötchen inside and outside. in the summer months they have some tables out side between their custumers cars. forget the opening ours in this post. they are false. check their website for more current information concerning their opening hours"
4,Sten is extremely friendly! Such a quaint cute little cafe.  The pastries are delicious you must try them all (:
4,"Unbedingt empfehlenswert!    Wir haben gestern einen wundervollen Abend im Restaurant Unter Deck erlebt.    Von einem sehr netten jungen Servicemitarbeiter wurden wir in Empfang genommen und an einem geschmackvoll eingedeckten Tisch platziert.    Nach dem Apèro, welchen uns der sympathische Mitarbeiter offeriert hat, sind wir in der gut gestalteten Karte schnell fündig geworden.    Schön ist, dass sich die einzelnen Gänge der vorgeschlagenen Menüs untereinander kombinieren ließen, da die Einzelpreise jeweils aufgeführt sind.    Weiterhin war die Zeit zwischen den einzelnen Gängen sehr gut abgestimmt.    Besonders hervorheben möchten wir den sehr freundlichen Service der beiden jungen Mitarbeiter, welche uns von Anfang bis Ende mit herzlicher Freundlichkeit sehr gut betreut haben.    Die servierten Gerichte waren geschmacklich gut und schön präsentiert.    Das Restaurant Unter Deck haben wir auf die Liste unserer Lieblingsrestaurants in Hamburg gesetzt, und kommen auf jeden Fall wieder."
4,"Skyline 20up Bar is located at the 20th level of the Empire Riverside Hotel. A lot of tables were already booked when we arrived and the inside is quite small, so I advise you to come early or book your own. The bar offers you a great view on Sankt Pauli, Altona and Harburg. Their cocktails are amazing and not like the usual ones, there is a good research on the texture, colour and presentation."
4,Great choice for northern German dishes.
4,"UPDATE 28/04/2009: Been meaning to edit my review of JB for a while, as they've hugely upped their game a year on, and now serve what I think are my fave burritos in Hamburg. Also - the staff who work here are all ace. Last night we got treated to the Vicious Viper hot sauce (see photo), which is officially the hottest sauce in the world. Probably. ***** Passable burrito action slightly sparse on the sauce side of things, which is a bit ridiculous if you're paying an extra euro for guacamole. Still, they're nice enough and the place has a bit of character, along with these weird TVs from the back seats of cars stuck to the counter playing all sorts of weird films."
4,"First time in Germany and my boss recomended to visit this place after work. It reminded me of a quaint French Bistro that found its place in Germany. I ordered a glass of wine and the potato and leek soup. The soup was a great consistency and pretty filling. Don't forget the bread that was served, in which I asked for some olive oil. I was brought some sea salt that went well with my bread. If you want to relax with a nice glass of wine afterwork. Try Tati's Bistro!!!!"
3,"Mmmm, burritos! Big, filling, yummy, vegan and vegetarian burritos (they have beef/poultry too but I've never had one of those).It might not be the best burritos in the world, but they get the job done. :)The wait is always long, but the beers are always cold so who cares? We return every time we're in Hamburg, sometimes twice in a day..."
4,I came here as a guest at a group party with a fixed menu. So I can comment on the regular menu. We were a party of 30. The service and food were excellent. As an american I have a discriminating taste for good beef. Frankly my opinion of burgers and steaks here on the continent hasn't been good. I rarely order them because I have been disappointed so many times. But I had a wonderful steak here. Char grilled and obviously a very nice piece of beef to begin with. Juicy and properly cooked medium rare. The sides served family style were hot and a nice variety. The assorted desert plate was a nice surprise as well. Prompt service with plenty of attentive staff.
0,"Horrible. For food that is nothing special and found exactly the same, but cheaper all over the city. Don't bother here. Service topped off my bad experience. In the confusion of not understanding German. I accidentally took the pommes of the lady in front of me. Realising what I had accidentally done, the chap serving me told me that I would be getting one less sausage and instantly took one off my plate before serving it to me. Wow. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible way to treat a customer."
1,"I was here 3 times. The first 2 times I came here with one person. The food were super super good, then I brought my other 3 friends here with full expectations but we all were disappointed this time. May be we came there at a wrong time (Easter time) or their main chef is on holiday, no idea. They offer Surprises Menu all the time. The first 2 time (2 persons), we had 6 warm+cold appentisers but this time 4 persons only had 5 appentisers and the portion was the same as for 2 persons. The beef was tough and no sauce for the whole dish. When we asked for a ketchup or sauce and they answered it is not their practice to offer sauce. We are very disappointed and don't know what is going on in this restaurant."
3,"Monet, Renoir, Degas, Nardin, Valjoux, Rado, and Piaget!And if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that those last four are not French impressionists, they're Swiss watchmakers.Anyway, Kunsthalle is about as much fun as watching paint dry, as visiting this place basically amounts to three hours of watching dry paint. It's a very, very classic art museum. Mostly framed oil works, a little sculpture, a little modern art... not very stimulating to a layperson like me who just doesn't go for this stuff.So I'm not the best person to ask, but I think I can safely say this is a classic, non-interactive, super-quiet, admire-only, hands-off museum. Tickets are reasonably priced, they have student discounts, and all of the captions have English and German. Very Anglo/American friendly."
4,"This American and all my American friends absolutely love Qrito. It is so fresh and delicious I could eat there everyday. Some of my friends actually do! It is the closest thing to the USA's Chipotle or Qdoba. It was a blessing to experience this place on the recommendation of a friend and not only do they have comforting mexican food, they have American candies and American sized soda cans in flavors you can't get anywhere else. Lunchtime is typically packed with students, but you'll get a seat with a little bit of patience. The people that work there are always friendly and even bring your order to you once it is ready. Word has spread about how great and fresh the food is and I would recommend this place to anyone. The prices are not bad at all and they are always efficient with their service. Various meat choices as well as hot sauces."
4,"The Speicherstadt, literally: 'City of Warehouses', meaning warehouse district) in Hamburg, is the largest warehouse district in the world where the buildings stand on timber-pile foundations, oak logs, in this particular case. It is located in the port of Hamburg--within the HafenCity quarter--and was built from 1883 to 1927.The district was built as a free zone to transfer goods without paying customs. As of 2009, both the district and the surrounding area are under redevelopment. As the first site in Hamburg, it was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site on 5 July 2015.The architecture is amazing and you can walk around and explore the buildings from the outside. It's a wonderful part of Hamburg and not to be missed. We walked around here for a long time and some nice cafes and things also in this area."
4,"A good place for burrito lovers and ""alternative"" people.I'm vegetarian and burritos are one of my favourite foods, so when I found this place I was excited to see their menu is conveniently divided into meat/vegetarian/vegan selections - with more than enough choices in each category.The burritos are big and juicy, the kind you have to eat with a fork and knife, and are some of the best I've ever had. When it's busy you might find yourself waiting quite a long time for your food, but the atmosphere is nice and they specifically say that on their menu so there's no surprise. All in all, one of my favourite places to eat in Hamburg so far."
4,"Nicely situated along the Elbe and the sous-chef that started this dining fusion concept used to be associated with the Landhaus Scherrer from what I was told. It is a bit out of the way to reach if you do not have a car, as the nearest public transportation by train is Landungsbrücken or taking a bus (112) along the Elbechausse. Once you arrive, the place is neatly organized, however due to lack of space and popularity of its infamous reputation, they pack tables in a bit too tightly. It is one great room with everyone lined up so closely, I can hear my neighbor chewing their salad.  Not a good seating situation for the claustrophobic, however, the food is so nice and service impeccably attentive, that one easily forgives the spacial limitations and enjoys the intimacy of the surroundings instead. All sushi is delicious, I mean, really. If you love sushi, order by favorite ingredients, as we all have our personal favorites that we crave consistently, but if feeling more adventurous, one can do no wrong here. Fresh, tasty, exotic rolls, that satisfy.You pay for sushi quality, so expect a reasonably pricey bill at the end of your meal, particularly if you are the type to go Rambo like myself and order with big eyes and a curious stomach :)  When sushi is of a higher caliber of quality, I often opt for sashimi, so not to waste my low carb diet on rice and extra sauces when the fish alone tastes marvelous enough with a spot of low sodium soy sauce and swipe of wasabi for good measure, topped with a ginger garnish! Sehr Lecker...If with a friend, do some fresh light appetizers, order a variety platter, and a bottle of Riesling, followed up with a warm chocolate dessert if available.  You will leave feeling like you just fell from sushi heaven.  I normally take in this experience with a friend, when we feel like having a nice, quiet, special sushi dinner away from the Mitte madness.My only complaint? I wish it was not so far from my home and off of a main public transportation route, but tis the price one pays for the views that can only be witnessed next to the Elbe River."
4,"This place is amazing for a rainy day! So much detail. So many great things to look at, so overwhelming but stick with it."
3,"Whoa! Their pizza is HUGE. Luigis is such a cute little restaurant. it's a nice mix of cozy and hip. We had two glasses of red wine, a hot tea, a carbonara classico and pizza parma all for 40 euros. Amazing. I thought their carbonara was really good and it's nice without the sauce. It seems like they use fresh noodles here as well. The pizza parma had arugula and ham on it and it was pretty damn good too. Cheap, delicious, and I will be back."
2,"A pretty standard Indian place. It's nothing extraordinary but is part of the Schanze scene and like most places has seating outside on the sidewalk. I found service to be quite disinterested and not fast which started annoying us after a while. Food on the other hand was good and the two times I've eaten there, it was good. Unfortunately I find that the portions are quite small and they skimp on meat if you order it. If you're just looking to sit outside and have a couple beers, this place is fine. If you want great Indian food, there's other places that are better."
4,"Less than two weeks ago we celebrated our wedding day at the Parlament's private room  the magnificent Rose Room. There aren't enough words or pictures to describe the beauty of the room. Please, try and go there and see for yourself, when we first went to see it our jaws dropped, we knew right away that that's the place we want for our wedding. It is an elegant, classic, ancient room that makes you feel in a fairy tale. From the info page: The Rose is the room in Parlament most steeped in history. Kings and ministers were received here and the daughters of Hamburg ship owners were married here. An impressive feature is the filigree ceiling painting and the imposing chandeliers. Being a sailor's daughter, this was perfect. But that's not all! We were looking not just for pure beauty, but also for a special place, for a small family and close friends celebration that will be able to provide us a vegan buffet (ya ya, vegan people get married too). The first step was to contact the lady who's in charge for private events, and wow, Mrs. Casper was absolutely amazing. She was super professional, friendly, available at any time, and the perfect person to count on for such a special day. All our special requests were fulfilled, the chef created a state of the art vegan buffet (all the guests were NOT vegan and were shocked and happy and thrilled realizing how tasty and rich the food was), the tables were set the way we wanted with our artistic cards flowers and funky confetti and our balloons hovered around, making the room even more festive at the end of the event we all went outside and send the balloons to the sky. The Rose Room and the Parlament staff contributed a great deal to the success of our day. We are grateful! Bottom line: if you are looking for a WOW place, professional staff, special menu and the best location in town  this is your place!"
3,My first time in a vegan restaurant and I gotta say it was really delicious. As a vegetarian it was also nice to be able to just look at the menu and know that I can order anything I want without having to think about it because it's all-vegan! The restaurant is also really pretty and the people were very nice.
3,Lieblings is located close to Reeperbahn. It has a variety of ice cream flavors. The ones I tried were all really good. Great place to stop by when visiting St. Pauli.
4,"I loved it! So much food, friendly staff, cool environment! But don't forget to make a reservation."
4,"This is the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Hamburg I know - they didn't even used to have a menu; rather, those 'in the know' would just order one of five house menu items, like the pho or bun of the day.  Now they've modernized with a one-page menu with pictures, perfect for the old and new fans alike! Very affordable, good home cooking.  Difficult to get a table after noon on the weekends, but it's worth coming early for!"
3,"Went once for the specialty/fusion sushi that is offered  awesome! So tasty and very creative. Fancy atmosphere, need to reserve in the evenings. More on the pricey side, but high-quality food."
3,"Cool student bar in the Grindel that actually has more going on than meets the eye. Inside theyve got a foosball table and a back room where theyve got jazz on Wednesday nights, show Tatort on Sunday nights, and host other smaller concerts as well. The furniture is a nice living room style hodge podge set up, the people that hang out are friendly and so are the folks that work here. Drinks are well priced and theyve got a good selection of tea as well. Soft pretzels are a nice touch when you want something salty to go along with your beer. Some nights they have a DJ as well spinning some of his favorite vinyl. By day a great place to read or play chess and by night a great place to have a drink with friends and chat up the others hanging out."
4,"Amazing. I am a bit of a foodie and traveler and this was one of the best restaurants I've dined in. If you are looking for authentic German food, white tablecloth service, a local atmosphere, and an unbelievable price point- look no further. My brother and I stumbled in later in the night, but the kitchen gladly remained open until close and served us with enthusiasm. Our server was lovely and made us feel at home. The food was outstanding (get the pancakes). We ordered a few courses and drinks and our bill was only about €45. We were expecting more. If we return to Hamburg, we will return to Sangers."
4,Authentic Indian food! Especially the naan! The portion size was also perfect. Only thing that was a bit irritating was the limited sitting space.
3,"PRICEY but it's 20upThis bar is inside of the Riverside Hotel at the highes floor of this buidling. It's worth your time, especially at night while sipping at your 13€ cocktail and enjoying this wonderful panorama view of Hamburgs waterfront through the large windows starting on the ground and going all the way up to the ceiling.Visiting this place is a mix of:Relaxing, spending time with friends, dressed business casual, seeing Hamburg from a different angle, enjoying the drinks and emptying your wallet.No need for reservation, just wait in line.(Only 4 Stars because I don't like to empty my wallet.)"
4,This place is Amazing!! The servers are very attentive and very nice and the food is great! All the food is very fresh and it doesn't break your wallet and the portions are huge.
2,whatever happens do not order the chuck steak! it is a piece of sh...flubber...or fat rubber...if you respect your stomach and want that organ to stay intact...get the sirloin instead. the sirloin was nicely cooked and tasted proper. The waiter was nice enough to refund my appetizer because i had to spit out the chuck steak into the plate....So for the good sirloin and the customer service..this place gets 3 stars for my taste....I really hope they remove the sub-par food from their menu.
1,"I was there last night with a couple of friends who raved about La sepia, saying - and i quote - the best fish they have had. I am not a fish fan, but i do love seafood. I got the seafood salad and we shared a plate of octopus. Well my salad was... dull.no sauce.fortunately it had a lot of seafood to make up for the unsaucy greens. the octopus were ok, i've had better. otherwise it was a busy night hence it was really slow. we didnt get served at the same time. drinks took around 15 minutes to get to our table. i wouldn't be back soon"
4,"At first glance Ti Breizh was odd. There was only one outdoor bench and the first section of the restaurant appeared to be a store of some kind, sorry I never found out. This is because we were led out back to the deck-top seating on the canal behind the buildings. So fun! Apparently there are three floors of seating indoors as well.We split two savory crepes, one loaded with 4 toppings and one simple with just cheese. This was perfect as we split the toppings up and had plenty.The creamed mushrooms were much better than I anticipated, and the spinach and onions were great options too.We finished with a sweet crepe, the one with cherries and rum. It was very good, but I'd say I enjoyed the savory crepes even more. If I lived in Hamburg, I'd come back for sure!"
4,"Fabulous!!! Friendly service, terrific food, beautiful setting. They made my husband, our toddler and I feel welcomed and appreciated. Plus the lamb! The wine! We can't wait to come back!"
4,"Great! I'm from California and this is my first time trying to eat Mexican food here. Not that it's so easy to find. I had the chorizo burrito and it's GIGANTIC! I just finished the rest of it for dinner. The chorizo is actually spicy, which surprised me, since it is Germany. haha. The people are really nice there. It's clean, not too expensive,but a little crowded at lunch. I will definitely go back and try all the other things. Es war toll! Ich komme aus Kalifornien und das war meine erste mal Mexicanessen zu probieren. Es ist ziemlich schwer zu finden. Ich habe den Chorizo Burrito bestellt und es ist RIESIG! Ich habe gerade die Reste für Abendessen gegessen. Die Chorizo ist scharf, es war eine Überraschung. haha. Die Leute sind sehr nett. Das Restaurant ist sauber, nicht so teuer, aber ein bisschen eng in die Mittagspause. Ich gehe gern zurück und wurde gern alle die andere Sachen probieren."
4,"Mix with the locals and treat yourself to a phenomenal casual weekday lunch or early dinner at Fischfeinkost Delikatessen des Meeres (which roughly translates to: Fischfeinkost delicacies of the sea). This place is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a foodie, you have to check it out. If you're not a foodie, you should still check it out. The reviews are super impressive and very well deserved, and popular with the locals it is. Always a great sign, right?Ok, so here's the deal: you enter the space down a few stairs from the street level. You order your dish and a drink at the counter. The place is made up of a pretty cramped connection of tiny rooms with only a few tall tables around. Some with stools. Most without. But in pleasant weather, the great majority of folks are outside on the open sidewalk umbrella-covered tables that are pretty much full of people either enjoying their food or waiting for their food. When they have a bunch of dishes ready, they put them out on the counter and ring a bell. What? No, I'm not kidding. Then a bunch of customers just swoop right in and grab their dishes. Apparently everyone is a regular and already knows the drill, but I still have no idea how people know who gets what or when that bell ring is for them or not. Just bizarre, but it certainly seems to work. These are very happy diners, for sure. Luckily for me, the counter-lady was really sweet and clued in this rather clueless American when my dish was included in which bell ringing round.I had ordered the seafood lasagna w/carpaccio. Sounded amazing, and it certainly was. OMG. Happy me! Delic!! Lovely fresh pasta and veggies in a somewhat deconstructed lasagna style with a lot of yummy broth. Somewhat soupy. Just fantastic. The other dish available that day was a swordfish with potatoes on a bed of greens. Looked amazing and appeared to be the most popular. The Chef creates the menu each day of only 1 or 2 dishes, based on the freshest ingredients available in the markets that day. Brilliant! Simple concept. Simple food. Nothing fancy. Just fantastically prepared super fresh big plates of homey food. Everyone brings out their own flatware/napkin/drink to their tables, picks up their own dish from the counter when ready, and self-busses and drops off their dirty plates when they're done. Highly highly recommended!"
4,"Fantastisch und wirklich kaiserlich. Sehr geschmackvoll und mit viel Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet. Die Speisen sind authentisch schmackhaft und die Besitzerin (eine echte Österreicherin) sowie die zauberhaften Mitarbeiter/innen im Service sind bemerkenswert aufmerksam und sehr kompetent. Dieses Kleinod mit herrlicher Sonnenterrasse in der Hafencity habe ich für mich entdeckt und empfehle es allen, die den Standard satt haben und das Besondere unserer Tage suchen."
3,"Large portions, mostly friendly staff although nearly getting into a shouting match with one of them simply because we waited about 10 seconds before telling him that we were switches tables with another group is definitely something that should never happen.It also didn't help that a friend wait first to the counter to order his things before I went simply we both didn't want to leave our valuables at the table unguarded. Ordering seems to be complicated here ;-)That being said, the good was great! I had a huge Enchilada with Mole Poblano on top of it. Not a big fan of the chocolate flavor here but that was totally my own fault for not reading the menu ;-)We also had a Burrito which looked and smelled excellent!I would definitely go there again but only when its not too crowded. If the two incidents with the staff hadn't happened, I would have given Jim Burrito 5 stars."
3,Weekly menu with a handful of different dishes plus a selection of wines. The prices are fair and the food was good. You definitely have to reserve a table for dinner times. They also offer outdoor seating with extra heaters.
2,"The beer is the star here. To my palate, it's distinctive across the three brews offered, each having a very aromatic, herbal quality. The food is solid German brew house fare with a twist. There's a curry-laden Thai soup that's delicious and a German ""tapas"" plate featuring mini-schnitzels, rõsti and wurst. The canal-side setting is quite nice."
3,"Die Pizzeria is a family favorite for us, partially because it's so close to home, but also because their food is really quite good, the ambience is casual but nice, and the staff is really friendly.The pizzas are an extremely thin crust, cooked perfectly. Because the crust is so thin, the margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella) is probably my favorite. They have chili oil available, which I usually put on to give it a little kick. I've tried a bunch of the other pizzas, too, and they're good, too. They also have a handful of pasta options, which I've tried a few times. By far my favorite pasta is the linguine aglio, olio, e scampi (garlic, oil, and shrimp), which comes with a heap of arugula on top, and just a really great flavor overall. There are soft drinks, wines by the glass and bottle, and beer on tap. A few of their wines by the glass are excellent, and reasonably priced. I always get the feeling that I'm being slightly overcharged at Die Pizzeria, but I think that's just the Eppendorf surcharge (everything is probably 20% more expensive than it should be). When it's warm enough (or when the locals decide it's warm enough, they also have seating outdoors. They'll even set up a TV for big sporting events (World Cup, etc)."
4,"The couple who run this place are great. Vampirish, fixed smiles and waxy skin and absolutely perfect to run a gorgeous, gothy bar. Incredible range of absinthe and other drinks. Don't come here when you're in a rush, each drink is lovingly made, which takes a while. But totally worth it, absolutely divine. When I next visit Hamburg with a friend of mine, I'll make sure we go here. I'm making this place a favourite cos they made sure none of my drinks tasted aniseedy!"
3,"Cheap and nice food but it is always crowded so the staffs are agressive sometimes. So if you don't mind the service, this is a good place to eat."
4,"Dining at Vienna is really something of a special treat! The food is marvellous and fairly priced for the quality, the table service is friendly and abundant, and the dining room, while small, is cozy rather than cramped. There are only a handful of tables and a waiting area with a bar, so it is recommended to arrive at 1800 on the dot to avoid missing out on a table. (They don't take reservations). I ate a mouthwatering fish soup for starters, with homemade chips and a tangy remoulade on the side  great combination. Following that, and sticking to my theme of seafood, I practically demolished the Skrei fillet with pumpkin crust on a bed of spinach, leaving only two small potato fingers on my plate. While a peek at the dessert menu proved tempting, we opted out as a result of feeling perfectly satisfied after entrees and main courses. After all, the portion sizes were quite generous,(and delicious!) This trio would return to Vienna at the drop of a hat, as the rest the dishes on the menu remain to be sampled! A fabulous conclusion to an unforgettable weekend in Hamburg."
0,"Been there once due to the many recommendations and was really dissappointed. Bad service: slow, uncoordinated, sloppyFood was average at its best I have to admit that we were a crowd of 12 people which is always a little tricky for the chef - but we ordered a table in advance - therefore it should not have been a surprise. Overall: Not worth the trip to Wandsbek at all."
1,"To summarize:1. Friendly but the person plays with his iPhone all the time2. Food is not good. Phó --- is not good, because the meat seems not very fresh. 3. Would still recommend for people who never had Vietnamese food. Because the environment is not bad for hanging out with a group of friends ..."
1,"This wasn't a great burger experience for me. I ordered the avocado burger, which was small compared to other burgers at our table. In my opinion, the ingredients were pretty bad - I didn't enjoy the taste of the guacamole or mayo, and the bread and beef were below average. The food was slow to be served, and the french fries were were pretty bland tasting. The sweet potato tasted better than standard, which I would stay away from, but honestly I thought this place was very mediocre for the price."
3,"First of all: No, Steffen Henssler was not there during our visit :( He is the most famous (and best) TV chef and cooking entertainer. Location: The location is very close to an U-Bahn-Station. It is rather small, but got a very high-quality and cozy atmosphere. We just loved it. Everything looked so nice, clean and had a recognizable ono-branding. What always makes a good impression: open kitchen, where you can watch the sushi-chefs make your sushi.But it is always overbooked and hard to get a reservation. So plan your visit a lot in advance.Service: The staff was very friendly. Got everything we wantedFood: Very good food. I've never had such a good fish in my life. I was a little bit sceptic, because I don't like tuna, but the yellowfin tuna was awesome and did not taste like the ordenary tuna (you find on pizza). If you order something, you should have fish/sushi. Pricing: Prices are a little bit higher than in a standard sushi restaurant. We paid around 80 Euros for 2 persons (main dish, desert, drinks). But it is totally worth it for special occasions or just have a nice unique evening, you will remember."
0,Walked in with 2 friends and was seated in a good seat by the window.  3 minutes later another waiter came up and demanded we move to another table same size but in the back by the busy kitchen and bathroom stairs.  He was rude about it and could have just taken one of the chairs we had if he needed it for other people.  Who cares about the food when the atmosphere starts with a rude slap in the face.
3,"Happy hour EUR5 cocktails until 9pm. EUR3.50 Augustiner Brau. Cool interior, good central Altona location. It does have a bit of a problem with very awkwardly sized and positioned tables, but otherwise it's a cool bar."
2,"I was recommended Gazi Antep by friends, but I can't say that I was impressed. Far from it in fact, it seemed like a pretty standard kebab shop with nothing to make it stand out as particularly good. I can't totally remember what I had, but I think it was some kind of doner plate."
4,"This place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Probably the best tourist attraction i have seen so far! I was really surprised at how much i enjoyed my time here. I went in thinking I would spend one hour at most in this place and three hours later i could not get enough of this miniature wonderland. They have really thought of everything when creating the little moniture wonderland. The amount of detail that was put into this world is absolutely astounashing! As soon as you walk in they have the exhibit of a town in germany and they take you through the history of the town through various years. As you walk through they have a display of Switzerland, Hamburg, The airport, USA, Scandanvia and Bavaria (there might be one or two that i am missing maybe?) Italy was under construction. My absolute favorite was Switzerland, it was huge and it extended a bit on the third floor. Make sure you spend enough time in each country for the day-night transition because that blew my mind. The way the lights flickered and the train lights came one at a time was very life-like. They even had little miniature people inside the trains and cars as they went by. You will experience everything in this place, from a miniature concert experience to even little disasters (I don't want to spoil anything). This place is a must-see attraction. If you are in hamburg you have to go! Best 12euros I have ever spend!"
4,"Great location situated in a boat moored on the harbour side. Tables at windows have great views. Good breakfast of bread roles,  cheese,  meats, egg and great coffee. Must be one of he best locations in Hamburg for breakfast."
4,"You fancy a steak but also a burger and can't decide which one you want for dinner? Well there you have it: Grinded premium steak meat between two buns -Bombdelicious my friends! And all of that between 9 and 13 bucks. It's the first time i had a burger with dripping blue cheese sauce - tasty! I'm just amazed by the variety of special stuff those burgers come with...one of us had the ""Drunk Ghetto"" with a shot of Vodka (cheers). For all the ""healthy"" ones of us...you can either choose a side of fries OR spinach or ceasar salad. They don't say it specifically on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Oh and for the really tough folks out there, try the Chicken Wings Napalm. But be brave, as it is already saying on the menu ""crazy hot""... it will clear your head in a second and gave my friends, quote ""hallucinations"". I was being a chicken and only had a bite....still needed water though which the waitress already had in stock for us since she saw us puffing.The waitresses were in general very alert.So 5 stars are flying to the bird!"
3,"The food here was pretty good, the service was decent, and the building itself was pretty cool to look at. The salmon was pretty good. It wasn't amazing, but it was one of the better ones I've had in Hamburg. The meatball was tender and juicy. Very good. The side salads were also very good, as was the sweet mustard that came with both the salmon and the meatball. The starter we got (a traditional German dish of ground of herring - I can't remember the name) I didn't find particularly good, but the person I was with enjoyed it."
3,"Fresh fish, fast service, nice waiters, card or cash for pay. I didn't like Tom Yam, but rolls are tasty and look good."
2,"I was quite curious after all these great reviews!Unfortunately, underwhelmed by it myself.Let's start with the good: the servers are fun, the fish is fresh and cooked well, the location is 'typical Portuguese quarter' (but note that this means a view of parked cars and being surrounded by smoking people when seated outside).But the cooking was hit and miss; e.g. Tuna with a mint pesto - excellent, fruit sauce with white fish - awkward combination, steaks - completely overcooked; the order medium rare - get medium well kind of off the mark. The house wines we were recommended were not good at all, the white still being the best of the three. The red wine was served outright warm...Be prepared that the 4-course meal, 50€ plus drinks, will be very filling; they definitely don't skimp on portion sizes here."
4,"Fuck yeah, finally some pizza that doesn't leave me hating myself and my choices in food delivery."
4,"delicious! good service with fast serving food. the menu changes everyday. limited choices but that also means, they perfected those dishes. only downside is, they do not open during the weekend and it closes fairly early in the evening."
4,"I know it is going to sound strange to read this, but I gotta let it out. How niiiice the people here are. My best friend wanted to book a table yesterday and one of the staff members from the kitchen just showed us a piece of paper which basically said: Please take NO more bookings for tonight! He smiled at us and showed it to us, but asked us to leave our number just in case there might be an open spot later. My friend received a call, called back and this friendly woman just said: Hello Alex! Yeah..now you are surprised, right?! And he was. Unfortunately they didin't have a free table for the time he wanted, but he said being declined with such a nice explanation will make him come back pretty soon and this time he will book days in advanced. This seems to be the new/old hidden hot spot in the hood.I am exited to get to know it and then write another feedback."
4,"The ""Hamburger Rathaus"" is really impressive ! We can see it from far away.I just loved its architecture, particulary its roof with blue tiles.Unfortunately, I didn't had the chance to visit the interior."
4,"Love the concept: Choose either the predefined salads, or make your own combination.All the ingredients were so fresh, and it was a huge bowl of salad - I couldn't even finish it.Please note that theres a serious rush hour around lunch, place is probably best avoided at this time. Then again - we came during lunch and still found a place to sit. People dont sit too long, so tables free up all the time.Aaaand - theres free wifi. Bonus when you are tourist!"
3,"I ate it at 2 a.m., not drunk, and didn't feel like crap! YAY! Great bratwurst and fries, wolfed it down like starving dog and was fully satisfied. Can definitely recommend for the late night munchies or the drunkie munchies, whatever you prefer."
3,"Great restaurant off the beaten path, in Eimsbüttel, one of Hamburg's liveliest and most interesting neighborhoods. The name is unusual, referring to swimming lessons, and there is a bowling alley in the basement. It's this quirky personality that makes the Freischwimmer charming. The decor is a sort of simple chic that reflects Hanseatic understatement. The food is interesting and well executed - a combination of German and Mediterranean. The wine list short but quality. And the service is knowledgeable, attentive and friendly."
4,"There are a lot of reviews, they all praise it. So do we. Enjoyed it, must go if you go to Hamburg. I would say it should be the reason for you to go to Hamburg, and you can also see other stuff in town.Service is top, WIFI is top, if you can arrange it go in November, January and February (as they guide told us), and during the week.Sunday it is always full and then you can have three rows in front of you. So if you can arrange it, come off-peak.Additionally book online upfront, so you don't have to wait."
3,"I daresay I liked this little restaurant as much as any bistro I ate at while visiting Paris!Le Plat du Jour has a traditional fixed course French menu dinner setup - 30 euros to pick one from each of three courses. There is one ""plat du jour"" representing the nightly special you can elect for your entree.I started with a salad but my co-diners got the pate. I have to admit I was a little food envious looking at their plates! The mains were all very nice - our table had a fish, some sort of very rich looking liver dish, and the ""plat du jour"" involving chicken drumsticks. All with requisite amounts of butter and French sauce, right in the middle of Hamburg."
4,"Amazing place to spend your day. Depending on how crowded it is and what you prefer to do, you can easily spend hours here. You can also only send an hour or two if that's your preference. I was with a group no one in the group had been there before. It also shares a building with a Dungeon museum as well. It's a few flights of stairs up to the ticket area and there is an elevator as well. The lines are split up into no reservations, reservations, and private tours I believe was the last one. The day we went was very very busy. When we went to buy tickets we had the option of waiting a few hours until the crowd thinned out or come back later that night. There was a store and cafeteria that also served as the waiting area I believe but we chose to come back later. I thought it paid off as it wasn't as busy later in the night. It was open until 1 am which was great but surprising. The souvenier store serves as the entrance and exit. There are tons of good toys and trinkets which I bought a few on the way out. We didn't get a chance to eat at the cafeteria but it looked like typical cafeteria food with drinks and snacks as well. The seating area, which there were tons of seats, was all old airplane seats. Mostly two seaters facing each other with tables. Cool set up. The actual museum starts with the history of the museum and how it started. They have headsets, which are in English as well, that explain the first few exhibits. The workshop areas were also here. Because of how late it was, they were all pretty empty. Once you get past that, the ""real"" part of the museum starts. Miniature set ups of all types. Sweden, USA, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and a few more I believe. There is also a working airport as well and other little random displays. If I had to use one word, mind blowing would be it. The amount of detail and the displays are amazing. There was a set up of a live out door festival which was pretty spot on, like almost everything there. The displays also change times of the day, I want to say every 15 minutes or so, so the same displays now come to life via the night. Lights turn on, headlights, street lights, etc, Many parts are also moving with a push of the button so there is tons to see whether its night or day. This is where you can send hours on each display just studying all of the little things going on. Most of the displays also have a ledge to stand on so you can lean over and see closer. This is also where big crowds here can get difficult. The working airport is one of my favorite parts. Planes of all types take off and land and gate and refuel, load, etc. It's pretty amazing. If you're a Star Wars fan, there are definitely a few references which you'll have to pay attention to spot. Definitely one of the coolest places I've been to in a very long time. I will definitely be back."
4,"The service is pretty slow (they are very understaffed), but the food is great. The scallop satay was really delicious. The chilli club salad was alright. The dressing was pretty fatty and the duck was fried. The chicken satay was pretty good, but also seemed a little unhealthy. The california rolls were very good. The red chicken curry wasn't so great. The sweet coconut curry with chicken was excellent and the chicken in it tasted fantastic with just salt and pepper.Even though the service was a little slow, our waitress was extremely friendly. I'd definitely recommend going here."
4,"I just loved the atmosphere here. It was very full but the service was great and the hearty food hit the spot. I wanted to linger and take in the interesting surroundings of the old apothecary shop. I'll put this at the top of my visit list next time I'm in Hamburg. Give it a try. It bistro style,not flashy, but honest and enjoyable."
4,"The coffee is ground exactly right, the milk is done to perfection and I even have a gorgeous little pattern on the top of my milk.. what am I drinking??? The most amazing, delicious, done to perfection LATTE!!! Finally! Who would have thought???!! I was almost having a breakdown thinking that the only place I could get a real latte was back at home in Melbournehowever, Swedish Cream has come to the rescue! It is a tiny tiny shop right where the Hallerstrasse U barn is where you can sit in or take away, and grab a piece of cake at the same time. The staff are really friendly and laid back, and efficient with their service. So even if you are in a hurry, there will always be time to grab a quick coffee to go from here!! I tend not to sit in here and have my coffeeit does not really have the atmosphere to make me want to lounge around, so I just come here to literally grab my coffe and go. However, many people like to stay in and sit on the stools at the window (while getting in some great people watching!!). The shop even holds classes on how to make coffee which is a great idea. I will be back hereevery dayhaving now to get up earlier just so that I have enough time to take the detour to Swedish Cream when driving to work!"
4,"Ich war das erste Mal im Locks und war total begeistert. Der Service war erste Klasse und das Essen oberlecker. Es war knacke voll ab 19 Uhr, aber für mich steht fest ... ich weiß, wo ich wieder hin gehe."
3,"Our continued search to find some of the best Neapolitan style pizza in Hamburg led us here. And it's definitely a new favorite for my wife and I. Very good flavor for both pizzas we tried and a tasty and pretty chewy crust as well, however, the crust was slightly thinner and a little bit crisper than I would have liked for a standard Neapolitan pizza.The restaurant is a very spacious area, with a pleasant rustic and warming setting and atmosphere, and with plenty of outdoor seating as well."
3,"If you see the locals eating here, you know that it's gotta be good...but it was soooooo good. This place was bustling nearly 24/7 for a reason. We passed this place several times of day over the two days we were in town as we were staying nearby and every time the tables were filled...12PM, 6PM or 2AM...this place was putting down excellent food. We came here for some late night goodies after a night out and then more importantly for dinner one evening and I was thoroughly impressed. The ezme and homemade pita bread (more of a cross between pizza crush and naan) as a starter on the table was TOO DIE FOR! Such a great first impression. Then the rest of the food that followed was just a pile of flavor explosions! The meats are incredibly well season and prepared. The vegetables are fresh and all the sauces are lick the platter clean good. Highly recommend this as a stop while you're in Hamburg...at ANY time of day. Only complaint...the place was HOT! Really warm and wish they would use the A/C a little more liberally."
3,"The best burgers in town! I love me a cheeseburger on most occasions, but save my visits to fast food joints as last resorts. Somewhere, between 1eu McDonald's burgers and 7eu beef monsters from Oma's are the Jim Block burgers - fresh, affordable, quick and really really tasty - on a a plate with a knife and fork. A burger will set you back between 3-5 euros, depending on the size (regular vs. ""Jim Block burger"" or something of the sort). Expect to stand in line quite a bit during the evenings, and try to get one of your party to physically reserve seats for you while you're ordering, otherwise you'll be eating standing up. Well recommended for a quick dinner minus the junkfood guilt."
4,I haven't found a better place to eat good fish in Hamburg yet. The place is really busy but it is definetly worth waiting for a table. Try the Taschenkrebs 'natural' and the Jakobsmuschel-Spiesse!
2,"Came here with work colleagues for something to eat.  As it was a nice day, we sat outside.  A casual arrangement on benches which means you may have to share a table with others but this is part of the atmosphere.  Of course the outside is probably more popular with the smokers so us non-smokers have to suffer the odd whiff of smoke in our direction.  A popular social area, there are street performers so if you are lucky you may get some live music as you dine.  Down side is that you can also get approached by beggars.Extensive menu of Japanese food from sushi, curries, noodles, rice dishes etc,  I think you would be hard pushed not to find something to eat.I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki which was nice if not a little too salty with a little too much sauce.  Nevertheless I ate it all.  My sushi loving companion loved their sushi dish.No pressure to move on once you have finished and so you can chill out with a beer after you have eaten also.Staff friendly (menus in German but then I didn't ask for an English one) and good value for money €65 for 4 of us with drinks and tip in that price."
4,"I love this place! This is one of those good friends that just never let you down. The creativity is always inspiring mixing tastes that are truly delightful with beautiful presentation that makes me pause a moment and just take it in. The atmosphere is sophistocated while keeping it very down to Earth. I think anyone would feel comfortable here. I really can't call this place expensive - considering the quality and when you go hereyou know you're getting something good! Check the menu on their website, that way you won't be surprised. :-)"
4,"First of all, you probably want to make a reservation. I dropped by for dinner on a weeknight without a reservation, and they basically said ""We're completely booked but you can sit here for an hour."" I guess I should have known based on how full they were that the crepes would be really good.I had the L'Apetit, which is a standard ""ham, egg, and cheese"" galette topped with spinach, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. It tasted far better than standard, however! The galette was perfectly cooked, just a little bit crispy on the outside. The ham, egg, and cheese combination was already really good, but the toppings were all surprisingly tasty as well. Each was flavored a little bit differently and the combination of flavors (plus the crispy galette) worked really, really well.The atmosphere is like sitting in a cafe in France, so you might get a little confused about where you're located in the world! Staff are friendly and fluent in English. There's also an English menu available if you, like me, don't speak German. Prices are pretty decent at around 10 euros for a savory galette.I've had galettes in other parts of the world, including France, and this place is near the top of the list. I was too full to try out a sweet crepe, but I'd like to come back someday!"
3,"This was the first place I ate on my my first day working at Qype. It's also now just across the square from where I now live.The food they serve is really really delicious and extremely good value.The decor and service is a little random, however that's all forgiven by delicious food that you can eat with a clear conscience."
4,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this restaurant while exploring Hamburg on our vacation from the US. My boyfriend is vegan, so food options can be very limited. Piccolo Paradiso could not have been a more perfect place to enjoy an early dinner. We sat on the patio, which was peaceful, with a nice cool breeze. Our waiter was incredibly kind and helpful, since neither of us speak German. He went over the entire menu with us, in English. We decided on a vegan antipasti/tapas platter, as well as a dessert to share. It was the best mixed plate of food I've ever had - vegan or otherwise. The compilation of different flavors from different regions and countries was absolutely divine. We savored every bite. The limonade was delightful as well. We tried the rose water as well as the raspberry, and they were both refreshing, cool, and crisp. Dessert was decadent - chocolate creme brulee that was to die for. Favorite meal we've had in a very, very long time. Best in Hamburg, for sure! We recommend it, 100%."
4,"As a big fan of all things Middle Eastern, I can appreciate good falafel. The food served at Falafel Haus is simply great; nothing chewy or dry, like in those drunk-food döner places. The falafel is freshly fried, their hummus is delicious, the prices more than fair, and the service is friendly and quick.I would highly recommend it as the best falafel I've had in Europe!"
4,"Great Food, but, BEST Pizza!! - If you don't like to wait (even with reservation) and don't want to hang close with locals (it is somewhat tight in there), this is not the place for you. But if you worship Pizza...man this is it and great atmosphere the later it gets. If you ask for Sambuca, they'll give you a whole bottle and trust you with it and you'll get into party mood with the patrons."
3,"I was there with a group of friends from Japón and my boyfriend. Their love the sashimi, the quality is the fish was good and of course fresh. I was exciting because of the yakitory, but it was the worst dish from the table.I'll try to go again to give them another change."
4,"The handmade ice cream was so good and fresh, the staff was so helpful and friendly, the shop was so clean.  The affigato is a must try!!   Will definitely be back for more!!!"
4,"We went there on our last evening of our Germany trip. We had high expectations, and were afraid that they might not be fulfilled, but they were! The good was amazing! We had pulpo and bruschetta as an entree and Himachi and entrecôte as a Main course. Everything was delicious! The Location is really nice and surprisingly not that loud as I expected. Our waiter was really kind and nice. She checked regularly if the wine and beer were empty or not. Btw, the White ""House wine"" was really good! We will come back next year when we will be the next time in Hamburg"
4,"One of the coolest bars i have ever been to in my life. 3 room flat, is a 1970's house party. Well, on the surface. beneth lies a secret german fight club, i mean table football club...its kind of sureal. the beer is cheap, and the selection is plentiful. the sofas are comfy, and the people are nice. But piece of advice, the toliets are alittle unclear as to which is guys and girls...not that anyone minded...germany is a very liberal place"
3,"3 Euro for a falafel brot (which is actually a wrap). It is hot, tasty, but not the best i had. In Berlin one can find much better falafel joints. This place is an amazing solution for hunger after midnight when most place are closing down. I was afraid a vegan like me would not find  anything at this time, but found this as a great option. The place was full, and there is a cozy sit down tables on a gallery upstairs."
3,"Really nice new-ish place on the catwalk that is Schuterblatt, hence, a bloody good venue from which to enjoy a cold Augustinabrau. The signs on the toilet doors to indicate the correct genders permitted are not to be missed!"
4,Pretty cool  spot for having cocktails  and wine  with a lot of people. Seems to be a place to be for a night out !
0,We have waited for one hour to finally get our food :( They gave too many excuses. The food is also NOT satisfied!
4,"Absolutely amazing ""all you can enjoy"". Don't worry about the limit, you will very unlikely get there. And it's so convenient to order your food by iPad."
4,"Seemingly run by a husband-wife combo, this is a really nice little Italian place for lunch. It's a bit imbissy with its high, small tables, but the food is great and a reasonable price. I had a Diavolo pizza and it was the best pizza that I've had in a long time. I'll be back"
4,"It's good old fashion currywurst They have lots of different levels of heat but unlike other places, their curry sauce has lots of good flavor. If you're looking for a quick bit stop here, they owners are friendly and can speak English if needed."
2,"Unique decor.Meat and fish menu are really nice, but the sushi and hot drinks needs more improvement."
4,"Ooooohhh how I love this place!! Great decor inside with a very cruisy and relaxing atmosphere. The coffee is good, but not brilliant, however they have the best ever toasted cheese and tomato sandwiches!!! The Gloria burger is also a winner. Food is cheap as chips and quite substantial servingsso go on an empty stomach! The beer selection is great and the staff are attentative and really friendly. On a cold winter sunday, I could stay at Gloria all day..."
4,"Completely amazing, spell binding and impressive. Make sure you wear comfy shoes and leave enough time to see it all! And the tip at weekends & holidays is to pre-book your arrival time on their website to avoid unnecessary queuing when you get there."
3,"This is a nice restaurant/bar in Barmbek. As far as I know it's the only nice one ;)Very close to the Museum der Arbeit (Museum of Work), so you can get some culture before the booze and the food. Which, by the way, is quite good here. But also quite expensive. Nevertheless the place is always crowded in the evening, so make sure you come early.Biggest downside: If you're sitting outside the noise of the airplanes is really annoying."
4,"Just finish classes at Colon Language School? Go to this small basement restaurant called ""Delikatessen des Meeres"" two buildings away. There's no menu. The chef cooks one dish per day and varies daily, depending on what's freshly supplied on the day. Sometimes shrimps with potatoes, sometimes salmon spaghetti with mustard sauce to die for. EUR 5,50 each. Portion is humungous. You'll drop your jaw to pay so little for such quality food. Fresh!! Waiting time is long, between 20-40 mins during lunch. You will be told the number of bell ring to collect your plate. Sitting is limited to indoor area, can get quite narrow during winter. Great ambient to eat with Opera and Classical music. Food cooked with love. Best time to go: Summer before or after lunch-time (waiting time 5-10 mins)! There's many sitting area outdoor. My perfect place to chill out under sunshine in Summer!!! Best goes with a glass of wine for EUR 3,50... hmm, maybe two..."
