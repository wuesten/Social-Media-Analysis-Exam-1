3,"Katze is a cool new bar on the Schulterblatt. As you might guess from the name is a little bit cat-themed, but not much, because that would probably be rubbish. At the time of writing (6 November '08) this bar is so new that it still smells of wet varnish and paint, and the outside of the bar looks unfinished - there's no name for example. The bar staff are mostly young, attractive and blonde. The punters seem to be of a similar ilk, but maybe not quite as blonde. There are free bar snacks on every table, but they don't serve any hefeweizen. However they make up for this small oversight by serving Augustiner brau. It'll be interesting to see how this one develops, but things are looking good at the moment."
4,"This is a great burger joint in Hamburg.  My favorite so far in the burger joints I've checked out in the eponymous city!The closest comparison I can draw is to London's Patty & Bun - Dulf's is a messy plate-full of beefy delights, customizable in many different ways and overflowing with goodness.  The restaurant sits in the Karolinenviertel, which is a millennial area with Notting Hill-like vibes and tons of recent grad-aged people.Dulf's Burger serves 150g patties of Charolais beef - if you have never seen this French breed of cattle, then google it - spoiler alert: they're huge.  Served atop your choice of three different buns: sour dough, sesame, or brioche, the burgers are sumptuous and the toppings are plentiful.I went for the Farmer burger on a brioche bun, which comes topped with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, a fried egg, homemade burger sauce, and overflowing with coleslaw. Dulf's range of homemade burger sauces is quite impressive too: highlights include truffle, wasabi or cumin sauce....Of course, I went for the truffle sauce.I wrote a bit more about it on my blog; beeffanatic.com/2016/11/…"
2,Nice Café Bar serving tasty green tea and some fresh selected kind of homemade pies. They were playing cool Music that made a charming atmosphere to our conversation. Quite affordable and almost a standard around the corner. During the Summer the garden is a blast in a students district like that. But somehow the waitress wasn't friendly... WTF ? I will be there again for a beer very soon.
4,"I went here last night with my family and we all absolutely loved this place! I got the spätzle with pesto,rocket and cherry tomatoes. The spätzle was perfectly flavored and had just the right amount of cheesiness. The cheese spätzle was also delicious. 5 stars, no doubts."
4,"It's exactly the kind of place that you expect when you're looking for a cosy, crammed and delicious Italian restaurant. This place has great lunch deals.Make sure you make a reservation when you want to go there on a Saturday evening."
2,"Ended up here to watch the world cup one evening and it was quite an interesting experienceto my left, a couple with a baby, on my right, a rawkus of Korean businessmen going at it like the world is ending on a bottle of something-or-other and their table grills. Every 5 minutes SLAM! and they all did a group shot.In the middle, myself and friends watching the game (and the businessmen) commenting on the fantastic English translations on their menu. I honestly can't remember what I ate, don't really like Korean food, but it was a good time and definitely memorable."
2,Everything was decent here- quite good non-dolsot bi bim bap (ie the less expensive option not served in a hot stone bowl) with ample namul sides. Problem is really the pricing- 15 euros for the dolsot option is more like $21 Canadian and that's just not worth it. If I lived in Hamburg and were desperate for Korean I'd make a beeline but I can't see coming back when there are better and cheaper options back home. Service was fast and very friendly.
3,"Went for lunch on an overcast Tuesday afternoon. Not too busy and we got a table right after ordering. You order with the cashier, pay, and then sit and they bring out your food. I couldn't decide what to order and ended up with the pastrami special that was right in front of my face at the cashier. I asked for the sandwich without bread and over a salad and though confused at first that's exactly what I got! I'm impressed with the customization options here and that the kitchen got it right. The big salad with pastrami and a small bottle of water was 11.60, the ""menu"" price. I was expecting to be charged for the sandwich and the salad so this was a positive. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. Salad wasn't the freshest but it was decent and with plenty of pastrami. I think I was the only person there not eating a burger and fries so I'm assuming they are good too. If I remember well it was cash only, or cash and EC card only so be prepared!"
4,"It's refreshing to see a kebab shop that is always packed full of people! This bustling little place is the closest I've seen to a kebab place merging with a bar. The staff are really funny, and always seem to make up a randomly lower price than the menu. When you ask for beers they fill up a carrier bag with load without enquiring as to how many you wanted! I love it. Food wise there's a massive selection of healthy stuff, including a lot of roasted veg, humous, rice, unleven bread etc. You won't get bored... ... and the killer factor? It's at the end of my road. Mr. Kebab  Dubara. Fact.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=D7Nx…"
0,"We were invited to a large dinner party at La Sepia and had high hopes. The folks around the table kept buzzing about how the restaurant is known for it's good fish, and any fish I was bound to order would probably be the best fish I had had in a while. Unfortunately, the fish at La Sepia blows. No, I didn't get a bad dish - the folks next to me, who also ordered the ""Fischplatte"" (an assortment of different types of fish), received the exact same meal. All sat there swooning over their meals as I stared bored over my food, fork in hand, and exclaimed: ""THIS is what you think good fish tastes like?!?"". Don't get me wrong - for many people, the fish at La Sepia will be the best fish they have ever tasted. These people have probably been mainly having fish from the Elbe river. The sauce is pretty good. For the rest of us who are used to Mediterranean fish, the fish at La Sepia will be dull, tasteless and boring. Conclusion: He who travels to the coast of the Mediterranean sea shall have real fish. He who stays in Hamburg should stick to sardines."
0,"That was the worst food poisoning for mussels I ever had in my life, almost survived! Do not recommend this kitchen at all."
4,I came here as a guest at a group party with a fixed menu. So I can comment on the regular menu. We were a party of 30. The service and food were excellent. As an american I have a discriminating taste for good beef. Frankly my opinion of burgers and steaks here on the continent hasn't been good. I rarely order them because I have been disappointed so many times. But I had a wonderful steak here. Char grilled and obviously a very nice piece of beef to begin with. Juicy and properly cooked medium rare. The sides served family style were hot and a nice variety. The assorted desert plate was a nice surprise as well. Prompt service with plenty of attentive staff.
2,whatever happens do not order the chuck steak! it is a piece of sh...flubber...or fat rubber...if you respect your stomach and want that organ to stay intact...get the sirloin instead. the sirloin was nicely cooked and tasted proper. The waiter was nice enough to refund my appetizer because i had to spit out the chuck steak into the plate....So for the good sirloin and the customer service..this place gets 3 stars for my taste....I really hope they remove the sub-par food from their menu.
4,"Delicious food, generous portions, friendly staff in cool atmosphere. What's not to like? Can't wait to go there again."
4,"Since my visit in 2013, I've been telling everyone I know to go here who will be in Hamburg. (I'm a little surprised/ashamed I didn't write a review yet...)This place is incredible. It's several stories of a warehouse that's been converted into an aptly-named miniature wonderland. The attention to detail into every aspect of this space is simply astounding. It perfectly encapsulates what happens when smart, whimsical people set their minds to building amazing, tiny things :)Kids probably love it, too, but knowing my nephew we would probably never make it past the first floor-- it's that big and engrossing. I found the control center the most fascinating part, but others in my group liked the airport-- planes ""took off"", ""landed"", taxied and did it all over again on a schedule that was tracked in real time on a screen. Several places seem pretty darned accurately modeled in terms of what a place actually looks like; others have taken a wee bit of poetic license to make it fit within the warehouse (for example, the USA section represents Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and several other places that look as if they're right next to each other, when that is not exactly how it goes in the US). There's even a model of Hamburg. I won't spoil the wonder of visiting for yourself with any more details about what you'll see-- just plan to spend at least a few hours here to fully appreciate the splendor."
4,"One of my favourite restaurants of the area. They got a lot of nice Portuguese and Spanish food on offer as well as the usual San Miguel and Sagres beer. Loads of yummy seafood things (meat, too, for all you carnivores) and great tapas. All very delicious. Aioli and bread will get served before the main meal so you can feast on that first. And it's worth it. Even though your partner / colleagues will hate you later on / the next day.The waiters are really pleasant - and always happy to deliver a wisecrack on top of it all.Prices are moderate especially compared to the other Portuguese restaurants in the middle of the street.It's strongly recommended."
4,"This is one of the greatest accomplishments in the existence of human creation. If you're going to be in Hamburg, there are only 2 things you must do:1) Get a delicious hamburger2) Go to Miniatur WunderlandYou will be 1000% amazed with your senses overloaded. I think the best model is the airport. I could sit there for an hour just watching it operate. Do not miss watching the Millennium Falcon take off.One activity I wish I did was the challenge where you find certain objects/people and solve a puzzle. I was just too amazed when I walked in that I didn't even know the welcome brochure had the puzzle in it. I will definitely be back here in the future and will undergo said challenge.You can spend forever here so plan accordingly. While my daughter loved it a lot, she got tired after a while of awing at the miniature greatness in front of us.Just wow!"
3,"Ay Carumba! Casa Franco is so much fun. I came here last night with some friends and I had a great time. For 27 euros you get a four-course meal complete with a flaming scallop starter, fish, more fish, and a delicious dessert. Mmm. The owner of the restaurant is fantastic. He's so attentive to his customers and makes a huge effort to entertain the entire restaurant. We got several free shots of alcohol and the entire restaurant toasts together. The atmosphere is cozy, festive, and lively. There was even a traditional guitar singer that serenaded us twice in the night. My favorite part of my four course meal was the parrot fish and the crème brûlée-like dessert. I'm not sure what it was, but it was GOOD. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was 22 euros a bottle. I'd say the style of the food was Portuguese fusion. The fun part is that the chef decides what you will eat so you don't have to order your food. The fish that he served us was extremely fresh. I think this is a great place to go with some friends or to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday. At the end of the meal, the owner also gives the ladies a single rose. :) Four solid stars for the food, and 7 stars for the service. I'll most likely be back!"
3,"This one is not a restaurant, more a takeaway and a snackbar!I can recommend to take away, because its really full inside and the service its not the perfect one. But if you eat inside (or in the summer outside), the waiter is really nice and helpful!! Food: huge portions and yummy :D Some days,they are really bussy, but you should wait :D and try the dönerteller with fries :D enjoy your food!!"
4,"We were five in a group, everybody liked it, including picky German colleagues and as well picky Chinese. i am not in the position to compare it with other vegetarian restaurants, since i do not have many experiences. But as a restaurant, it is rather good. The sauce for rice, salad was made with care and delicacyyou can taste it! The price is in a budget-middle range, i just shortly glimpsed through the menu, many dishes cost around 11-14 Euro.Will definitely go there more often."
4,"I keep finding myself coming back here. Gloria is a lovely laidback cafe style bar, with tables outside, really friendly bar staff, and great pizzas. I'm always surprised at how little the bill is at the end of the night too! A great place to spend a Sunday evening..."
3,"Even without trying any other dim sum restaurants in Hamburg, I'm pretty sure Mei Moon will be our go-to place for dim sum. The hubby and I stopped in after an afternoon of shopping, so we were famished. It was barely 6pm, so I'd like to think we avoided the dinner crowd. The restaurant, though down a small, alley-like street, was not hard to find. You can't miss the red signage. Mei Moon wouldn't be a true Chinese restaurant if they didn't have a giant menu, and this they did have indeed. We stuck with just the dim sum menu and already that was about 40+ items. We ordered 7 items, all of which were super tasty.My favorites included:- Rice roll with BBQ pork- Shark fin dumplings- Prawn dumpling with leeksProbably one of the best parts about the meal was the chili oil. Seriously. It was spicy as heck and very fragrant. Very different, in a good way, than the chili oil I've had at home in SF.Service was friendly, food came out pretty fast and pricing is pretty on par with dim sum places in SF. We look forward to coming back to try the other non-dim-sum offerings."
4,"This spot is really charming; between the lit candles, fresh flowers, wife serving and husband cooking, this is exactly what one might envision when dreaming of European bistro. But let's talk about the food: Traditional Northern German. Unfortunately, I did not have time to research a lot before this trip, and ignorantly I assumed I would be limited to spätzle and sausage. Behold!  Labskaus - an old, traditional sea farer's dish, made from potatoes, pickled beef and beetroot, served with gherkins, beetroot and pickled herring. Labskaus reminds me of a non-greasy, light, almost fluffy corned beef hash. It was topped with 2 farm eggs and was divine. I appreciated that I was going to order a side salad but was advised against it because with the beets and gherkins, that would be too much. How honest! I finished with a spot of peppermint and ginger tea - fresh and strong. Between the reasonable prices, quality food and wonderful service, I would highly recommend this spot.Gluten free dining notes: The Labskaus does not contain bread crumbs, soy sauce nor Worchester sauce. Enjoy!The Creme Brûlée, however, is thickened with flour. :("
2,"I came here the other day with my man to grab dinner in the area near his office as we were running errands. This place had good reviews on yelp so we decided to check it out. The offerings on the menu were limited and were kind of pricey so we decided to try the All you can eat (AYCE) option which was 17 euros per person from 6 to 9pm. The AYCE option came with its own menu so we wrote down the # of all the sushi pieces we wanted to try. The fish selection was limited and really only the salmon tasted fresh. We tried various nigiri (only 1 pc), hand rolls, big rolls (theres only 2 roll options (one veg and one not)) and maki rolls.The tuna did not seem fresh at all and seemed like it was sitting out for awhile as it had a dark discoloration to it that I was not used to seeing and it didn't taste fresh too. The place is pretty small and fits a handful of people. The place was about half full and I think the table behind us also did the AYCE option but ordered everything off the menu so the service for our food took a lot longer then we expected. After we finally got our first round we did place and order for a couple more rolls and it seemed like it took longer then expected again as there were only 2 people making the rolls behind the counter and I believe they were making for the rolls for the larger table behind us as well as a bunch of take out orders that came in all of a sudden.All in all, the price is a good deal for AYCE sushi but the service was extremely slow and the menu options were too limited for me to be coming back here anytime soon."
3,"I was there with a group of friends from Japón and my boyfriend. Their love the sashimi, the quality is the fish was good and of course fresh. I was exciting because of the yakitory, but it was the worst dish from the table.I'll try to go again to give them another change."
4,"Bester Burger Hamburgs! Leckere Brötchen, sehr gutes Fleisch! Wer medium bestellt, bekommt auch medium! Die Süßkartoffel-Pommes sind auch top und vor allem wird eine recht große Portion serviert.  Die Location hat echt Charme, individuell und modern eingerichet ohne steril oder snobby zu wirken. Die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich. Reservierungen sind nicht möglich, wir haben aber kaum 10min gewartet.  Burger essen in Hamburg? Dann zu Otto!"
3,"Good after works, happy hours & some random students. Quite a nice location in city center, venue itself is trying to be cool and modern. Food is not my highest choice, but drinks are definitely 8out of 10! So for Thursday evening after work drink - big yes!"
4,"Wonna try good Hamburg fish...?? You can't miss Fisch & Co.! Really cozy restaurant (with just 3 tables) that prepares fresh fish on-the-fly. Dishes are delicious...I suggest to give a try at fish and chips...the best that I took in my life! Please note that the restaurant is really small. On rainy days it's really hard to get a seat, so good for takeaways, but not for long seating lunches..."
4,"The light show is really beautiful. I wasn't going to go, but changed my mind at the last minute. I quickly taxied over from my hotel and got out and ran to the park. I was able to make it there by 10:15 (it starts at 10:00) and the show lasted until 10:30. I sat on the side of the lake opposite the large tower on a cement block. It put me the closest to the fountains of anyone, but this also meant I got pretty wet. If you don't mind getting wet, I would also recommend going for that seat."
3,Pretty good gelato. I particularly recommend their sugarfree/glutenfree hazelnut flavor.
4,"They get some fresh fish from the market as a whole, which the guys like to show off, and filet them in the restaurant to make the freshest pieces of fish you can get. Then they are grilled and served in some very unique and excellent way. I loved the flavours they have introduced in the sauces which are not just the standard type of things you will find in a restaurant. A highlight are the gambas flambe and the fresh fish with Mediterranean veggies. Beside the excellent food the service is also great and in addition there is guy playing the guitar (actually he is palying really, really well). Holiday feeling at it's best in a small restaurant in Hamburg."
3,"Ah, it's just like being back in Munich! I love Munich, unlike most northern-germans, and the only thing this place is missing is a giant BMW factory. Authentically dressed waitresses serving up cheap grub and beer on benches. The size of your schnitzel is inversely proportional to the amount of sauce you get, hence Wiener Art - massive, and Jager, moderately sized. I really like it here."
4,"Really good oriental food. A really nice and cosy place too. Looks good from the outside as it does from the inside. The food is fresh and quick for a very reasonable price. It was crowded but not too loud. I went there with two friends. We all had different meals but everything arrived at the same time. The kumpir was perfectly cooked and the topping was delicious. My friend had a mixed starter plate which we shared but couldn't finish at all. The tea was perfect with the flavoures of our meals.Service was pretty friendly as well. Actually as I write this review, I am getting hungry and want to go there immediately I recommend this place for anyone who wants solid, good food and nice atmosphere before going out."
3,This is a nice plate for a quick bite to eat. You can feel a bit rushed when it's crowded with several people waiting in line. The food is pretty good and healthy . I usually get a salad or sandwich which is prepared for everyday consumption. Most of the items in the fridge have dates on it so you'll know when it was lasted prepared for eating.
2,"I don't normally go out for asian food (apart from sushi) since it has a tendency to either be meat-based or spicy (none of which I eat), but decided to take a shot at joining my coworkers for lunch here. I had the saitan dish - not that I had any choice whatsoever as it was the only vegetarian dish on the menu. The waitress warned me that it would have a ""basic spiciness"" but seeing as it was either that dish or no dish, I ordered it anyway. HOLY MOTHER JESUS OF NAZERETH THIS THING WAS SPICY. And delicious. And spicy. Too spicy. I couldn't finish my meal - had to run over to the bakery to pick up an egg sandwich instead. Have IBS like me? Don't go here."
4,"Ich war das erste Mal im Locks und war total begeistert. Der Service war erste Klasse und das Essen oberlecker. Es war knacke voll ab 19 Uhr, aber für mich steht fest ... ich weiß, wo ich wieder hin gehe."
3,"Danmark Snack is basically just hotdogs and burgers, but mostly hotdogs. It's a very unassuming little place, and so for the past year I'd always just walked on by to one of the other fast-food places. I had noticed that it's well reviewed here by German Qypers, and so when leaving the Reeperbahn S-Bahn hungry last night I popped in. The place is basically a hotdog factory, but they also have a few burgers if you want one of those. I went for a cheeseburger and it hit the spot. Not too big, not too small. it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but it was better than most of what is on offer at other nearby establishments."
3,"I was hanging out with my freinds and suddenly saw this coffee shop in the another side of the street .The impression of me about it is the concept , which is minimal , bright and cute xD. As i went in , the smells of coffee beans rushed in my noé, so delightfully ! No complaint about the staffs , very gentle and friendly."
4,Perfekt und sehr lecker!
4,"Wonderful Wonderland, we love going there. Even though it is very crowded and one needs a lot of patience, it is always a great joy. Especially the airport is so exciting, we could have spent hours there!We booked our visit in combination with a harbour boat tour and the Wunderland was open until 1 or 2 am. I'm not sure if they do that regularly though. So the later it was the more people left and we actually had some space and could enjoy everything.We will go again!!!"
2,"they were a bit overwhelmed although it was empty, the coffee was OK and the strawberry cake didn't have too much flavour. There WiFi was out, so maybe I just picked the wrong day. The staff was friendly, but not very chatty when I was asking for directions or something to see before I was flying out again."
4,The Strandperle is for lots of people living in Hamburg a kind of a famous café. They are right. It is really beautiful.It is directly situated at the Elbe and visitors have really a great view at this river. You may watch the huge ships passing by while you are having a coffee or you are enjoying your breakfast.A small beach is directly in front of the caféThe café is very special and you will find lots of young people spending their time here. Lots of people in the twenties and thirties go there to meet friends or to relax.The atmosphere is amazing. When you go there simply to have coffee and to relax it often may happen that people start a conversation without knowing you at all. This is the result of such a comfortable atmosphere. Everybody is relaxed and life is beautiful again.The service is very friendly and professional.It is really worth going there and enjoy this place.
4,"Best Döner in Town! The service is great, always smiling faces, delicious meat and chicken döner, big portions.Döner Tüte is highly recommended!;)They have also great snacks like börek..."
4,"Absinthe is certainly something different. Run by a couple who had been ""talking about setting up an Absinthe bar for 6 years"", they got around the legal issues of selling such poison a year ago, and are now living the dream. There's something very odd about this place. The ambiance is almost out of a vampire film, and quaffing copious quantities of the green stuff only amplifies it. The selection of spirits is extremely comprehensive. I would guess they basically have everything, and serve it in style. You could also take a beer here, but why would you? If I had to pick holes (apart from the ones in the walls!), I'd be that the seating is not conducive to curling up and going to sleep. I'd imagine this is deliberate! 5/5."
4,"Tasty food. I've been in Europe for 2 months and this was my first burger since being here... I was very pleased! I had the BBQ burger and I would definitely recommend it! I got the menu, which ended up being a bit too much food for me, but it was worth the price."
4,"I found this roastery yesterday, led by my nose when I was in the vicinity. The roaster gave me a personal tour of the facilities and I had a very good (and amazingly inexpensive; all drinks are 1,- EUR) Capuccino in the café in the upper floor."
4,Had a lovely dinner here in Hamburg at [m]eatery.Now I don't eat beef so can't review them on all their dry aged beef. Normally don't eat any meat but occasionally will eat seafood and fish. I started with the seafood chunky chowder and it was thick and creamy with tons of flavor. Great way to start. For my main I ordered 3 types of fish tartare. They could not have been any better. The highlight was the salmon tartare Asian style. Wow was it freaking delicious! Now my side dish may have stole the show. Mashed potatoes with sautéed shallots and black truffles! So amazing! So if ever in Hamburg Germany hit this place up!
3,"When I see people eating from the ""to go"" cartons it makes it look so damn good."
3,"Tiny little fish place. I had a mixed plate that was quite tasty. It's very ""mom and pop"" with just one lady doing all the work. Beware you will smell like fried fish if you dine in. Great for a light meal (by German standards!) and quick too, they also have takeaway options too."
0,Slooooooooow.Bad fries. Waited over 30 minutes for a draught beer and lemonade.Capacity (outside) approx 56. There were around 10-15 people.Now it's 35 minutes.
3,"Very pleasant deli cum bistro overlooking the new concert hall in Hafencity. When building is complete, this will be a great location. Right now, as with many of the places in hafencity you sit partially in the midst of a building site. Not dirty, but certainly noisy. But with tasty salads, expertly cooked pasta (and the not tried but good looking flammkuchen and tartines) this is still a really good lunch spot. And watching Hafencity go up around you is perhaps part of the charm!"
4,My friend told me that this is his favourite steak house in Hamburg. And he will come to the restaurant every time when he is in Hamburg. I order the lamb and it is really good. It taste very juicy and tender.
3,"I'm an Asian. Their Chinese food of course is a bit German style for me but for German it is the best what they can have with a very very good price, especially with the growing kids, they can have as much as they can. After the extension of the restaurant, the sittings area even bigger and more comfortable, and also they provide some outside sittings too."
3,"That's a weird beer. I like it but in Germany it's surprising to taste one that is so much different than most others. The weizenbier here is a little sour but it is pleasant, refreshing. Still, I don't know if I want it again or not. The haxe is tasty and fresh, although not that big portion as it first seems. A bit expensive but I guess for that part of Hamburg it's ok."
3,"I love the taste of the coffee, the cake, the Alster view, everything. Service is nice. A little more smile would give 5 stars :)"
3,"It'sbeen ages since I was at Panter last time. To my satisfaction my visityesterday confirmed that: a) this place is as cool as it was before b) cosy, unpretentious, good quality c) friendly service d) unfortunately limitedchoice of drinks, i.e. wine This place will suite you if you are looking for a nice & cosy place to have a coffee and chat. It's not spectacular, just good."
2,Good to go with a friend. The cheapest Hendricks gin and Tonic I have found in Hamburg major plus! Shabby chic all the way and a really varied mix of clients.
3,"Reservations are suggested but they were still able to seat our party of 4 when we walked in. The menu is in German. We enjoyed fricassee of chicken, white asparagus (seasonal item here) with ham, and German beer and wine. You pay for water which is served in a glass bottle (natural or still means without carbonated bubbles). We appreciated that they notified us that they were out of certain menu items and had substitutes to offer (i.e. alternate beef and fish entrees)."
1,"I've been to many dim sum restaurants, including those in China, but this one missed the mark. The choices are quite limited and the taste of the dishes are ok-ish. The vegan buddharol for example was really chewy and greasy, instead of being crispy. The other dim sums were ok, but a bit on the small side. We also ordered fried noodles with Cha Sieuw, only there was not enough meat in the dish... the staff was constantly checking on you whether you are finished eating or drinking, which gave the diner a 'fast-food' feeling. The paent could only be done with cash or credit card, they didn't accept (EU) Maestro cards... Hamburg really needs a Chinatown."
1,Food is good but not the service- also charges over 2€ for a tiny glass of tap water. Does not take credit cards? What year is this?
3,"Very nice, however if you are British and used to hot curries make sure you opt for the hot chilli when they ask you, otherwise the Madras is pretty bland.Also for most people a small box is perfectly enough for lunch."
3,Excellent cocktail menu with fun expert bartenders. If I hadn't smelled the bathroom it would have had 5 stars.
4,"Oh my good - Jenfeld. This Part of Hamburg is not really known as a top place to go. But ""top"" often means a typical place for hipsters and or tourists. So - follow the stars of yelp and get surprised.To me Hoang Mai is one the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. Uuuugh, its ugly here. First problem - the door is closed. In general you enter the restaurant via the shop beside. Hey if you solved this problem, the spartan interior and green walls may make you think ""am I right here"". YES YOU ARE!!!The waitress suddenly turned up, presented the menu. Asked If we are in first time. Explained all options of the menu (in really perfect German). Some of the food is vegetarian, but can be ordered with broth. In this case, broth is made of bones - no longer vegetarian at all. Good to now but anyway - bone broth, sounds really good!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because most of the people here are Asians. One more point to assume the food is authentic!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because the taste is mmmmmmmm really incredible. Portions are OK. Referring to the amount and quality, the price is ok, not cheap but neither expensive. So follow the stars - 'cause Yelp will help you to find the hidden stars!"
4,"We stumbled onto this wonderful place when visiting Hamburg in 2011.  We were treated with a hip interior, tasty treats, and friendly staff. Owner's attention to details is not only on the food, but shows through each reclaimed materials and objects throughout this depot. Definitely was a highlight of our visit!"
2,Good service. This place is well located and not over prices despite being across road from train station. Wasn't crazy for the pilsner beer I had but good selection. Food looks good from what I saw on other tables. Not a bad stop off but you feel like moving on from here eventually...
4,"An overwhelming experience in taste.  Every dish was equally delicious - antipasti dish, pasta Bolognese, and Hake with quinoa."
0,"Im really dissapointed about this bar..First impression was ok, nice atmosphere, funky interior and good sounds.After 5 minutes I felt like leaving as soon as possible.Its way too packed, dancing is almost impossible, and the 50degrees temperature doesnt feel like any festivity either..The music is good though, charts mixed up with good tunes, house/rnb style. Among the crowd students and older, lost tourists tried to get drunk and create themselves a good night out.Mine was everything except that.. When this old lady with yellow glasses and 60s jeans started to dance like a fool..she must have been on drugs, although that must be a weird combination as she looked like a lost schoolteacher from kindergarten, I had to move myself at least 1m to the left, just to ensure myself not to get involved in her wild expressional, private dance. After my friend Kat almost got smashed to the ground and hurt her knee by some drunk fat yuppies, we decided to leave... I wont be back. But I probably visited Hörsaals worst night..."
4,"Awesome Beer, Fantastic Food, perfect environment and a wonderful staff to boot. I love this place and can't say enough positive things about it!"
3,"The location is not suitable for finding this restaurant ""just by walking"". The interior is not something you want if you do fine dining. But the steaks and burgers are just awesome. They take the meat business very seriously. I mean VERY. Guaranteed you do not leave hungry from this place.For casual dinner with friends who like burgers and steaks, this is a must place to test. Keep in mind, that they accept cash only, no credit cards, so prepare yourself with cash when you arrive. The prices are not too high, but due to meat coming form USA, it is more expensive than normal restaurants serving meat."
4,"Wow. I used to live in Munich when I was a kid and have fond memories of eating Spätzle. Eating the Spätzle here was like that scene from Ratatouille, where the food critic takes that bite of food and is transported to his youth. The Spätzle is handmade and delicious. They seem to take great care to source quality ingredients. I had the cheese Spätzle with onions and bacon. I also requested a little of their brown sauce/gravy on the side. This place is also vegan friendly, with vegan options of most of their dishes. Would definitely recommend this place."
3,Amazing potatoes!! Definitely try the chilli and mediterranean one! The service was not the friendliest but the food is truly great and the place as such is also friendly
4,"We had a really nice dinner here during a quick trip to Hamburg.I like to start a steakhouse dinner with a classic cocktail (manhattan for me, martini for my date).  This place had a very good bartender on duty that evening.  The chopped salad needed to be a bit more 'chopped,' and it had a bit too much dressing but overall wasn't bad.  The meat was great.  I had Argentinian, because I prefer grass-fed beef, and my date had American.  Both were *perfectly* seasoned and perfectly cooked.  We would have liked to try the European beef (which is dry-aged), but the smallest cut was 900g or so?  seemed much too big.  The waiter explained the reason why the cuts were so big, but we couldn't completely understand.The wine list was extremely expensive, comparatively speaking, but seemed well chosen.  Service was very professional.  Beef:  it's a nice break from Hamburg Pann-fisch!"
4,"UPDATE 26/2/09 A TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO FORM! OK, I don't often write in capital letters, but without the fantastic pizza everyday, we'd never have got Qype redesigned would we?! Service back to it's good old self, and seem to get free wine everytime. I'm back in love. UPDATE 9/7/08 My my, how things change in the space of a few months! Firstly the 'summer pricing' - to make sure the tourists of historic Deichstrasse pay more, then the service... which has been steadily decreasing in quality for months, till it hit rock bottom today. Yes, I had probably the worst lunch experience of all my lunch experiences in Hamburg thus far! Seven of us sat down to eat, and 2 dishes arrived after maybe 15 minutes. Another 2 after 25 minutes, and the last three? A whopping 45 minutes after! I might add the fact that I had to get these myself from the kitchen, or that my cutlery was literally thrown down onto the table when I asked for some... but you don't need to know all that. I already warned 3 people off on the way in - now I'm telling you Qypers - don't eat here, ever! ****************Well being as it's opposite work, I do eat here a lot! The pizzas started out passable but when we pulled a late one the other week they pulled out all the stops and made some exceptional stuff that really good the Qype relaunch back on track. The pasta is usually very good, and beats Vapiano, without having to wait for 30 mins too. Service-wise, it's very friendly, and they're accommodating for large parties of hungry developers. I must stress, the conditions in the video don't particularly represent normality, but it was so funny eating whilst the building was collapsing around us yesterday, that I had to film it...Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=gJTr…"
4,"Long live Sommersalon! My friends and I love this place. The music is a great mix of funk, hip hop and R&B - old and new school. The DJ's will stir up some James Brown with Kanye and throw in some Rolling Stones too. It's a really cool vibe. No fancy drinks, but who needs them? And absolutely no mind-numbing, repetitive techno beats. It's never our first stop, but we always end the night there. The dance floor is jumping after 1am. The place itself isn't so pretty, and it gets really crowded but you'll have a good time. Ladies - take tissues. They are always out of toilet paper."
4,"This place is AMAZING! I lived in Hamburg for 3 months, and loved this place. The Durum Doner they make is made fresh all day. Juicy meat and amazing Tortilla like bread..... You will not regret going here, trust me!!"
1,"Beer review only.The beer here is very, very good. I could drink it all day long. And for the location and taste, the prices are fair. The restaurant is clean, and overlooking the water can be nice on a warm day with boats and people floating by.But, I'm never coming back here. The people are horrible. At first, I walked up to the bar because it wasn't clear. When I tried to order, the guy basically told me ""no, you'll sit down, it's full service here"" in a very rude German tone. When I looked shocked, he assumed I didn't speak German (I do) and repeated it in English. Then he asked if I spoke English, because I was still a bit shocked at his tone. ""You sure don't seem like you speak English either"" was his response. I should have left then...but I didn't. So, I grabbed a seat and apparently ""full service"" is German slang for ""slow as hell service"". It was 15 minutes until I got a beer. The refill took just as long. And it wasn't because my server (who wasn't as rude, but was far from friendly) wasn't working hard. Indeed, she was working TOO hard and had TOO many tables, so everyone's service suffered.As I mentioned, good beer, but I'll never be back. The people are rude, the service is slow. Horrible place from that standpoint."
2,"This is just another Asian in the line of those which are pretty far from original Asian food. Vegetable is not cooked enough, most of the dishes are way to spicy and place is mostly empty which makes it even more unatractive. Service staff is good but that's about it."
3,"Simple place to grab an authentic and really good Italian coffee, pasta, or toasts. Friendly, popular ... and I'd go from 3.5 * to 4.0 * if they managed to clean out the cardboard, boxes, Amazon shipments and stuff on the floor next time I visit. ;)"
3,"i went there for the first time on the Tanz in den Mai night!Entrance fee was just 2EURdrinks were rather cheaphowever it was so full with sweaty smelly dancing-elbow-to-elbow drunk people. They played 80s music... although im not a fan of that genre, it was ok. A lot of michael jackson for my taste, but i enjoyed itbut there was no place for us to standhowever turns up there is a second floorwe went up there and it was very pleasant.Different style of music, mostly commercial music and house (not very actual songs, but very danceable) there is also a bar - and a bathroom - in the 2nd floor. If you're ever there, keep in mind: there is a less crowded second floor :)"
2,"I came here during a night out with a friend last week and it was OK. We were looking for quick easy food that wasn't Italian (as he is Italian!) so coming out of a nearby bar saw this place and the hundred or so people inside and decided to check it out. We didn't even realise it was Chinese until we were inside and nearly walked out - often they are just overpriced buffets - but we had a quick look at the food area and decided to stay. This place seems to differ from the usual all you can eat places because there is a pretty good selection of raw ingredients to choose from which are then stir fried in front of you. Plenty of choice of starters, deserts, sushi; enough to fill you up either before or after a jaunt down the reeperbahn! So at just 50 euro including AYCE food for 2, and 2 large beers it was OK. I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner for 2 as its big brash and noisy but for pre or post booze fuel stop its perfectly acceptable."
4,"After trying few different flammkuchen in Hamburg, I would say this is the best in town. It's a cosy place, located in a hidden corner near Schlump station. The staff is very friendly, they gave me explanations and some good recommendations . We tried flammkuchens with dates and with salmon. Both tastes awesome. The crust is thin and crispy. Topping combinations are good. A warm Jimmy herbal tea is healthy and tasty. For dessert, we tried Creme Brûlée which is only available in winter. It was not bad but there is still some rooms for improvement."
4,"The place is my personal Vietnamese heaven. Veggie soup is very tasty and filling. A delicate veggie broth, rice noodles, tofu and green vegetables - that is what you get as a vegetarian/vegan pho option for 7 euros. So worth the money! Another vegan option I can suggest is a noodle salad with tofu. It's very flavorful and refreshing, but ask about fish sauce in advance!   Will come back for sure!"
2,"The sitting-on-the-floor option is a novelty thing and fun - for the first five minutes. afterwards you get a bit cramped. there's hardly any space and if you go with more than 4 people, conversation tends to get lost in curry fumes. Yet my friends never seem to get tired of it and always drag me into this place.The food is ok. Even though the menu offers plenty of dishes they tend to taste similar. Some of the dishes are served quite cold so ask if you're unsure. Also stay away from the lassis unless you like sweets with your main course.the service is a bit grumpy and not very talkative. still, it's ok+ food at an ok price at a great location!"
3,"Fantastic burgers! Good service. Wonderful ambiance. Cool designs. Just a very joyful experience here at Shiso Burger. Had the Salmon burger with fries and a coke and after first taste i can easily say that Shiso is a place to go for a really fantastic fish burger and others as well.Only thing, the sits are not the coziest and the prices are a little high for drinks with a combo menu. Also wasn't the easiest place to find, but in the end, I still recommend and will go again."
2,Fast service. Decent food. Nothing special but delivers what is expected. Caesar salad was more dressing than salad. My kids loved the place. Go figure.
4,Great coffee and food. The staff was very friendly. The vegan waffles were so good. The best vegan waffles I've had! Actually the place was so good I had to come back again the next day.
2,"Cute small coffee shop in EimsbuettelThe Speisekammer is a cute place to enjoy breakfast in the morning or a slice of cake in the afternoon.During nice weather you can watch pedestrians from their small patio or if it is too cold or rainy relax behind their large window front or upstairs where they also have a small kids corner.The cake is fantastic, the service a little slow. However, if you are not in a rush it is a good coffee shop to spend some time.+ delicious cake+ good coffee - slow service (bring some time and patience)Credit cards accepted."
4,Great location! I was there for the first time and the coffee is very delicious! Nice staff!
3,"Spacious cafe & roastery in the same development as the Ratsherrn brewery, which seems to be well placed for getting the sun throughout the day.Service was good & the coffees and cake were equally good and well sized. Someone more discerning with their coffee drinking than me could no doubt delineate between good or bad but I'm more concerned with size & temperature of the drink when it reaches me and both were up to scratch."
4,"Authentic, old school German atmosphere combined with some German Staples. It's a great environment to experience. And of course, the beer is plentiful. Schnitzel and basically any Würst are safe choices for your first forray or 75th return visit."
4,"The chocolate tour was very interesting. Learned a lot about chocolate, where it comes from and how it's made.  Enjoy tastes from every step of the process and make your own chocolate bar. Super fun time ad great quality chocolate!"
2,"The food here is simply excellent.HOWEVER, the service is arrogant and unfriendly to say the least. Be prepared to be treated dismissively and rudely."
3,Brüdigams combines  an interesting and relaxing atmosphere with quality food. Our waiter was really helpful and we ended up enjoying delicious wild boar with a delightful Bulgarian red wine. All and all the experience was great and good value for money. Would visit again.
3,The Goldfischglas is a nice bar at the Schanze. The menu offers the usual drinks and a few cocktails. It was very crowded and noisy. There is a tabletop football available. Enjoy
4,wirklich ein sehr gutes restaurant! pizza ist hauchduenn und einfach perfekt!
2,"Once upon a time their burgers and sweet potato fries were amazing. Now they serve you ketchup in a tiny paper cup, you drink your lemonade from an IKEA glass (used to be jars) and their sweet potato fries don't taste as good anymore. Burgers itself are good for the price offered on the lunch menu. Staff seems to change frequently, though they are always friendly."
3,"Great, real Austrian place. You come for the Schnitzel and you return for the Schnitzel. Authentic menu with everything you'd expect from the Austrians from Nocken via Zwetschge to Kaiserschmarn. Obviously consistently good since the place still fills up in the evenings. Make sure to reserve. The smaller schnitzel is sufficient but if you're really hungry, go for the large one. It will satisfy. Service was also super nice and you could see they all care. We went home happy and will be back, sooner than later. My favorite schnitzel is still at Casse Croute in Hamburg but this place is a very close second and literally just a smidgen less good."
3,"We went there for early dinner on our last night in Germany. The place was packed though the food came out at reasonable time. We ordered medium spicy chicken wings for starter. It was good but very spicy for us so we suggest if you want mild, choose the bbq variety instead. For the main course we had hickory bbq burgers served with fries on the side. The buns were brioche so it's softer than the usual burer buns. For dessert, we had hot fudge sundae which is my favorite. It taste better than it looks! My bf had a beer while I got a .75l of water. Our bill came at around €60. It costs more than our usual budget but we enjoyed the food anyway and it's our last day in our Germany vacation. It is not a quiet restaraunt. And don't expect so much if you want to be seated by the window with a nice view. I am not sure if they accept table booking because the feature on the website was not working when we tried."
4,"Great burgers and atmosphere. This is my favorite place in town, I've been there with friends several times and we all love it. I recommend the Gonzalez and the Big Rock Burgers, and if you are looking for a vegetarian option, the Black Beans Burger is really good. I highly recommend this place for a casual and relaxing dinner, just come with a bit of patience. Reservations are advisable for groups and weekend nights."
4,wie immer sehr fleischig!
4,"superb food, superb choice, reasonable prices. nice that they serve with tea and chips while you wait to pick up a take away order."
4,"What a great little cafe. Just stumbled upon it today with an acquaintance who recommended we stop in for an espresso. We ended up having a piece of homemade cake and this was fantastic. The majority of things sold here homemade and everything looks spectacular. The primary goal of the place is to sell tidewood but I think they do more business as a cafe. If you can find it, definately make sure to stop in. Although we had very little to do with the service personnel, it seems like everyone there was really nice. People were also hanging out there during the middle of the day, in a workweek. Seems like an awesome place to stop in for a coffee and just enjoy time passing by."
2,"The food is what one typically finds in Greek restaurants in Hamburg. The atmosphere is nicer than in many places, but often loud. It's a great place for a dinner out with a group of friends, but not the ideal place for a quiet dinner in two."
4,"What a unique and fascinating experience we had at Miniatur Wunderland! It is simply incredible to see the excitement and enthusiasm in the eyes of the children and their parents, while wondering through the Mini-World. So many little details to see and discover, all kinds of dramas and events have been carefully put into life in America, in Hambourg, at Frankfurt-Airport, in Berlin, in Switzerland, Austria or Italy ...! hours are not enough to really take in all one can contemplate in Miniatur Wunderland! We loved it, and will definitely go there again!"
0,We have waited for one hour to finally get our food :( They gave too many excuses. The food is also NOT satisfied!
4,"The best bar on Hamburger Berg- Rosis is similar to many of the other ""dive"" bars aufm Kiez but it has a special something going on for it which seperates it from the rest of the bars around here. Is is the drinks? Nah, an Astra here costs pretty much the same in every bar near the Reeperbahn. Just dont get caught drinking any other beer. Could it be the atmosphere? Maybe- the wood interior with paintings and lamps straight out of the 60s and 70s certainly lend this place some character. The foosball table and couch also add nice distractions when you dont want to dance. Oh, now that I mention it, its the dancing! People here just want to dance, dance, dance. The DJ on Thursday/weekends is likely spinning old soul 45s (think James Brown) and everyone just gets down, in an unpretentious way. The crowd here is totally not an ""Im here-to-be-seen"" scene. My stand-by when it comes to a night out aufm Kiez. Check it out."
4,"This place is amazing for a rainy day! So much detail. So many great things to look at, so overwhelming but stick with it."
3,Pretty decent bar aside all the Reeperbahn turbulences.Very friendly barkeeps which know their profession and will make sure you get the drink you want.
3,"Hier gibt es das perfekte Mittagessen: tolle Salate mit Ziegenkäse und exzellentem Dressing. Außerdem abwechslungsreiche Nudelgerichte. Beides auf Wunsch als 50:50 Gericht.Qualität sehr gut, Preis leicht gehoben im Vergleich zum üblichen Mittagstisch. Einziges Manko: Restaurant Schecks wie Sodexo werden nicht angenommen!"
0,"The food is really average, had a quinoa bowl, just a lot of over cooked quinoa with nothing in it, it came with vegetables with poor quality and no flavor... a sad boring vegan restaurant, vegan food is so much more than that !!"
4,"Ich kenne den Laden bestimmt schon seit 25 Jahren, mit meinem Mann bin ich zum Stammkunden geworden, als wir in der Nähe wohnten. Leider ist das nicht mehr der Fall, aber zu bestimmten Gelegenheiten ist ein dinner im 'la Pergola' zur Tradition für und geworden.Großartig die fluffigen weichen Brötchen mit Basilikumpesto, die als Gruß aus der Küche kommen. Man muß aufpassen, daß man sich daran nicht schon satt isst.Ansonsten: toller Service, leckeres Essen, moderate Preise, kuschelige Atmoshäre, ich persönlich liebe das Lammfilet mit Dijon Senf Sauce, und für uns beide ist die Rindercarpaccio mit reichlich frischen Champignons, Parmesan und Rucola oder das Vitello Tonnato ein Muß.Reservierung ist ratsam, die Plätze am Rand sind gemütlicher als in der Mitte und immer schnell voll."
4,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Hamburg. Excellent coffee, warm service and a tiny discount if you bring your own cup :))"
4,Best Ethiopian restaurant in Hamburg hands down. I am Ethiopian and I haven't had quality Ethiopian food in Germany. My girlfriend also liked it. The place is small and intimate. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to have a good Ethiopian food in Hamburg. P.S. you'd need to get a reservation in advance.
3,"The best thing about this place is that it's quiet later in the evening, which is when my boyfriend and I usually go there. It's also on the cheap side. The dishes we've tried so far taste very good. No idea if they are traditional Thai/whatever dishes, but we don't care about that as long as they taste good."
4,"Very cute crepery with authentic, delicious crepes. Lovely place to sit and relax. Great artwork and decor on the walls, with paintings by French artists.  Staff/cook are all French. I got the buckwheat salmon and legumes savory crepe, and ""the delicious"" as the sweet crepe. Both were fantastic but I loved the sweet one more. The toasted almonds were a splendid touch.  Highly recommend this place!"
4,"By far one of the best top-class Italian restaurants in Hamburg -- hands down.Recently, I went here with two guests from Dubai who have wined and dined in many of the best restaurants in the world.Gallo Nero's team did not let me down and my guests and I had a fantastically palatable three-course meal with excellent service in an authentically Italian atmosphere in a pleasant surrounding.We all had the pasta with summer truffle for the starter, delicious mains with either turbot, filet from the Fassona Piemontese, or veal, and a lemon-mint sorbet for desert. I am getting hungry writing this review by just remembering how delicious everything was.Yes, Gallo Nero is a bit more on the pricey side, but it is totally worth having very happy guests and such fond memories of an excellent Italian dining experience."
2,"There are more authentic Lebanese/Syrian restaurants in Hamburg. The guys made quite an effort so it's a little bit of a heartbreaker to give them three stars, but it is what it is.The main problem is, that the food really lacks authenticity and yet it comes at a quite high price for what it is. Please trust me on this one I have travelled the entire Middle East and I know what their cuisine is like. As a real Hamburg Docker I'll give you a heads up and recommend looking for another Syrian/Lebanese place to eat."
4,"After getting a late start in finding a place for dinner, very few restaurants were still open. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we discovered wonderful Cappricio. Very nice house wine, excellent Caprese salad, amazing truffle linguine and a beautiful chocolate mousse dessert made for a memorable meal. But the star of the evening was the service. Friendly, attentive and helpful. Definitely will come back."
4,"Skyline 20up Bar is located at the 20th level of the Empire Riverside Hotel. A lot of tables were already booked when we arrived and the inside is quite small, so I advise you to come early or book your own. The bar offers you a great view on Sankt Pauli, Altona and Harburg. Their cocktails are amazing and not like the usual ones, there is a good research on the texture, colour and presentation."
4,"I had come to Hamburg to listen to the magnificent Kate Tempest and my parents decided to come with me. Not to listen to the words of a slam poet, but to eat food and see the city, mind. We found Sagners because of the great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. Because we like to eat in our family, but usually don't have the stomach space to contain all the food we want to devour, we came to Sagners not that hungry. But there is a little something for everyone here. I had scrambled eggs with shrimp on blackbread, which could be awfully dull, but actually tasted like fresh shrimp straight from the sea combined with perfectly scrambled eggs. It was good. Sitting outside is not that attractive as it leads to a pretty busy road, but you'll soon forget it with all of that German beer and seaside fare inside you."
3,"Pony bar - yeah, not a bad bar. In close proximity to the Abaton cinema too, so ideal for a post-film drink/discussion of how intense the latest Rambo film was. Just joking, they don't show John Rambo in the Abaton, but I wasn't joking about how intense that film was. Especially the archery scene. Anyway - packed with students, one sign of its next to Hamburg Uni. The other being that you can pick up their WiFi. There's loads of action here."
4,Amazing food better than our visit to italy. The restraunt staff was so wonderful. We loved watching the chef cook our food and our mouths watered with every plate. The chef gave my son and daughter an ice cream and came personally to each table to make sure every person was happy and fully satisfied. Wonderful place they take visa Mastercard and dogs :) and my kids wanted to go again for dinner
4,Delicious food & fantastic service! Perfect place to eat with a baby too as the service is excellent and accommodating for all needs.
4,"**UPDATE 13/7* Music was absolutely fantastic in here last night! They really have an awesome DJ who doesn't want to bring it down till 7am, so we just couldn't go home! Plus 1 star from me, and highly recommended free venue for the 4-7 slot before you're off to the fish market! ********I really like this place, even more now I know they serve really cheap cocktails until midnight! It looks great empty, but you'll mostly see a heaving sweaty crowd of revellers. I'm not sure there are any fire regulations in Germany as I regularly see clubs/bars with more people than would be legally allowed in the UK, but, it's all good fun. Till there's a fire."
3,"Superb establishment. Everything everyone has said is true, I realised as much after my own personal cocktail consultation on massage Mondays! What do you like? What tastes, what spirits, what mood are you in? What's your favourite colour? What's your name, where'd you come from, how many. no wait. I got recommended a Hendrick's crush, which contains crushed kumqats! What an invention, a fruit that no one had any use for before, apart from ornamental, of course. Anyway, it was delicious. I've since been back and sampled the flammkuchen (also great) and watched the fish a lot. An impressive tank. On Monday nights every customer gets a free massage too - slightly surreal, but great!"
0,"Stopped in late for a beer and a burger.  Sat at the bar.  Placed our order with hip punk-rock waiter guy and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.  Enjoyed watching the staff eat their food further down the bar while we waited... and waited... and waited.  Finally, after a while we told our waiter that we couldn't wait any longer.  He told us to hold on and that he'd check our food's status in the kitchen.  He came back out and wouldn't make eye contact with  us. Douche.So, the food could have been good, but we never found out.  The service was ass."
2,"The Bullerei is located in a great location: a red brick building where the former slaughterhouses of Hamburg were located. This restaurant seems to get a lot of fame and attention from its celebrity TV chef Tim Mälzer, who owns it.Service was good and attentive, the food was good, but nothing special, prices are quite high for what you get. They specialize in meat, so that is maybe better, I did not have that since that costs even more.Not a must do but always a can do. The big open space all seats are in is not that cozy and inviting, for my taste.The Bullerei has a separate ""lunch"" / Deli kind of area in the front with a different menu.Will probably be back casually."
2,"Wow, I am glad I didn't pay 25.50 EUROS for this. Online prices are much cheaper. It's fun and has some local Hamburg history tied in which is cool and cruel. The fear and frightening factor is not as severe as I had expected but it's definitely well advised that kids under 10 aren't allowed (allusions to castration as a means of torture) and those 10-14 only with an adult. I saw the German show and much of its wording seemed to be directly translated from English - just didn't sound that natural in German. The acting was pretty good but I didn't like that you had to go through the entire thing with a rather large group of people. It's tight in some of the rooms and you don't have a chance to see everything because it's so crowded. Although it would be a lot more fun if you were allowed to take pictures or they would at least include the initial photo that they take in the entry price. Didn't feel like paying another 10 Euros for it."
3,"After hearing a lot of good words of this place, we decided to give it a second chance. This time they didn't disappoint us. The food is served really quickly, like 15 mins after we ordered. To be fair, the burger is really really tasty. And I love the sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo. After we finished, there were people waiting in a line for our table. And it is just a normal Tuesday lunch time. Will recommend it to friends, but just be ware that might be long waiting time for the table or the food."
4,"Everything was authentic- the service, food and atmosphere! Would highly recommend. We got both the tikka masala and butter chicken, which were cooked perfectly"
4,"This is my local Starbucks, practically across the street from my office. Starbucks...you know it. What should I write? If you like it, great. If not, go find something else. There's plenty of better cafes (in regards to taste of coffee) in Hamburg. At the same time, I get my wLAN here and can work well from the location. Plus it's definately one of the nicer Starbucks when it comes to interior. Don't forget to look up when ordering."
3,"If you are looking for a nice little Italian restaurant in hamburg then you should go there. They serve a really good pizza and also the pasta is good. The atmosphere is quite nice if you don't look at all the Italian kitsch around you. It's very small, so be there on time or reserve a table."
1,"Recommended by many in Hamburg for some strange reason.  If at one point this was a top restaurant, those days are gone. Passable Italian food torpedoed by indifferent, insufferable, lackadaisical service. Do not want to be unfair to the kitchen, even if the food is not all that either, but the main topic of conversation between me and my dinner partner was the poor experience at Gallo Nero.  They do have cute empty bottles of wine lining the walls."
4,"3 Zimmer Wohnung is a hybrid between house-party and laid back pub, with a dose of early 70's flair, a shot of late 90's tune mix and a bunch of people you don't know. Yet. The pub is divided into 4 sections; the kitchen (also the bartop), the living room, the bedroom and a small kicker area. All of these are dimly lit, and have shelves of random books and tidbits scattered around. In the living room, we found a half-dressed Barbie doll and a 1988 Guinness book of Word Records. While I wouldn't actually consider hitting the sack at ""3 Zimmer Wohnung"", it seems to be a great place for a laid-back evening excursion, especially as the music is low enough allow you to have conversations with your buds, but loud enough to sing and jiggle along. Very recommended, can't wait to go back!"
4,"Absolutely great food at the in house restaurant. The Chef made easy, healthy fare of the baked Perch fish with a creamy (basil?) potato side €13, green salad was super fresh €6 and tasty soda bread with a mustard honey butter spread. The hotel rooms are small but very nicely appointed, firm beds, goose down comforters and clean."
4,"Best. Schnitzel. Ever. This was my birthday dinner, and it was perfect. The restaurant is a bar and a room for roughly 24 people. No reservations. Waiting is standing room only. But it was worth it. Very much worth it. We both ordered the Schnitzel - since we did not want to share. Their wine selection is small but very good as well. I tried a few of their whites by the glass. Portions were perfect and the room was cheery and warm.Next time I will save room for dessert."
4,"We went during a weekday during lunch time & avail the lunch menu. It was not full, thus, we enjoyed a good service from them. They have a variety of dimsums to choose from. Choices for the main course is also very good. The menu have english translation/description in it and the waitress can speak mandarin. The prices are affordable. Each of the menu comes with a complimentary appetizer: soup -or- springroll. We enjoyed all the dishes (see submitted photos) and giving them all two thumbs up! The restaurant size is kinda small, but they do have two big round tables available for people coming in groups. Will definitely come back & will definitely recommend to others."
4,"Great little lunchtime venue with a superb value set menu option. Choose anything you like from the mains, plus a selection of delicious starters, and a desert for EUR7.50. Everybody finished what they ordered, and the food tasted fresh and healthy. Lots of salad, dressing... all that good stuff. On the downside - it's extremely dark in here for lunch - but then, Hamburg is quite dark at the moment, and, they didn't have the lamb because it was sold out. Probably a victim of tasting too nice. Try this place."
4,Love this place! Great burgers. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Asahi and saké with a Waygu Chesseburger and kimchi is hard to beat!
3,"I like Thämers. It offers a friendly, beery old-style pub ambience without a hint of oompahpah or that sneaking suspicion that they're putting it on just for you. Much more personality than the other offerings at Großneumarkt. Food is hearty but good (mountains of bratkartoffeln with everything!) and I find myself coming back here often for dinner and to sit and read outside over a beer and enjoy the balmy summer evenings."
3,"Classic Schanze! I can honestly say that anyone and everyone from Hamburg has been here at LEAST once. Literally, at least ""ONCE,"" I repeat that.  Even visitors have made their way to this bar and the allure is that well, you see it first when walking around the infamous streets of Schanzenviertel.  The typical routes are three main roads of either Schanzenstrasse, Susannenstrasse, or Schulterblatt.  I think Goldfischglas is again popular because it has a club/loungy feel and serves a good full bar at reasonable prices. There are plenty of places to sit, a dance floor downstairs, and a football/kicker table for a male testosterone match or teaming up on a date couple vs. couple or girls vs. boys :)I like this bar because the music is loud enough to listen to, but quiet enough where you can actually talk to people and socialize if you really want to.  They used to have this cool table in the center that had a neon glow with these fish shadows that swam around and they added just enough water on top to get your finger wet if you dipped it in to touch the screen.  People always played with it, because we thought you could control the direction the fish shadows would swim by touching the plexiglas screen, but i am not sure if that really worked or just mere coincidence, haha...People here dress a a bit more trendy than other bars in Schanzenviertel.  I feel this is where the preppy/casual crowd hangs out.  Overall, it is actually a good mixture of all different types and that is what I like, because there is always a different crowd every time I come here.  Sometimes older, sometimes younger, some in hooded sweatshirts and some in polos with Hamburg style red pants, and sometimes just all of the above.  It is also open late, so another reason for the popularity of the late night crowd. They make nice mojitos here and the crushed ice is nice on a warm night!"
4,"I just like this place the beer is always cold, the music (Indie/Alternative) is always brilliant, the people around are always friendly & easy-going and the barstaff are always genuine folks. The bar itself is retro-style (orange / brown) decorated with some glamorous wallpaper :)They also got a couple of smaller rooms next to the main one equipped with loads of comfy cairs, sofas and stools. All rooms are dimly lit and so make you feel at home easily. Yet it's a smoker-friendly bar which is a disadvantage for me personally but what the heck :) As a plus you could get the chance to bump into the odd rockstar coming from Knust or Schanze. Mutter is said to be one of their fave hangouts after the show."
4,"On my recent visit to Hamburg, I had a need for a good lunch.  Something other than a brat or a schnitzel and boy was that need fulfilled when I ventured into Luigis.   Oh boy, I had no idea that such good Italian food could be found in Germany.My first venture was simply a pizza lunch with a glass of wine.   Well that salami and mushroom pizza was one of the best I had ever experienced.   I have always held Pasquales in San Francisco to the number one pizza but now I think I have found a close competitor.  Awesome flavor and my wine glass was really like a fishbowl filled 2/3 full.   Thank you...My second venture was two days later wherein I experienced their spaghetti frutti-deMar.   OMG....OMG...done to perfection!   Very very good.   If ever I am in Hamburg again, I am going there for sure.Oh and the atmosphere is sort of eclectic and the tables are almost like shared in some areas with outdoor seating to be had as well.   Nice place!"
4,"Ja ja der Elbstrand, was wir da schon alles erlebt haben , (als wir noch jung waren xD) haben dort oft gegrillt, (Party gemacht) uvm. Ach ja . ich vermisse die Zeiten total .. aber man wird älter und hat nicht mehr so die Zeit wie früher :( Schade eig. aber naja kann man nicht ändern :( Der Elbstrand ist auf jeden Fall total toll =)"
3,"A very cool place in Hamburg Schanze. The burgers are excellent (150g patties). We came free to eat at 19:30 and had a small choice of tables, the place was fully booked. The potato fries with Rosmarin are an excellent side order the the fantastic burger (No choice of a bun but that is okay for me).Only thing is when you go downstairs to visit the toilet you must know that is an old house. Nothing more to say."
4,"I might have found a new favorite coffee place in Hamburg! They seem to roast their own coffee and it actually tastes really good. We had an Americano and a Cappuccino. Both tasted aromatic. Their waffles are famous, so we had to try one with Nutella and were not disappointed! Their cheesecakes are very good as well! I almost liked it more than their waffles. It's a nice place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon with friends and family."
3,"Great food with fantastic seating inside! Very crowded on the weekends so expect a wait. The food is served in trays and very affordable. About 6 euros per dish served with bread, rice, yogurt, Dahl, small salad, rice and the main dish. Lacks true authentic spice but very good still. Recommend tikka and the saag, and if you're a fan of spicy just ask!"
4,"As a non-smoker I only ever visit Duske & Duske to get my fix of English-language magazines, but their selection is surprisingly large (for automotive titles, that is) and the service is impeccable, in an understated, Hanseatic fashion. I think it's also much more charming than getting the mags at the train station anyway. Once I bought some cigars as a present for a friend, who told me they were top notch quality - they better be, for Duske & Duske's range isn't exactly cheap, but the helpful and competent assistance was a great bonus, particularly as I had no clue what I should buy."
3,"Ventured outside the central Hamburg area just to check out this restaurant. So glad we did! The staff is super friendly and greets you with a welcome Ouzo shot (you also get following dessert). We sat outside and enjoyed the neighborhood feel and summer air. We had a Greek Rosé, which wasn't for me, but everything else was amazing. The grilled octopus starter was hands-down the best octopus I've had in a long time. It is one of my favorite dishes, so I order it often always searching for the best one. Kalliopea does it just right- super tender, but yet perfectly crisp on the outside. The appetizer with a selection of various cold starters is a nice way to sample. The sliced fried potatoes are delicious. If you want soft potatoes, the ones with the ones cooked with herbs are good, too...all around impressed by this little place!"
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining, albeit oftentimes too loud. Everyone wants to be ""most important"". Whatever, these are all trust-fund babies or advertising drones and they never change wherever you are.The food is mediocre at best but there are some highlights. The place is not consistent which is probably the biggest complaint about their food. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow.....I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that threw it off. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish and we both do regularly get the Caesar salad, which actually is more like a chicken-teriyaki salad. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this and you go here knowing what you're going to get. At least the crowd is consistent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table. Of course, if you want to show off your Porsche, Ferrari, or Lambo, you can park it right out front and there are a lot of windows so that everyone WILL see that it's you. If you feel ignored, rev the engine a couple times......it's usually loud inside."
2,"I stumbled in here on the end of a girls night out already one too many vino's... there was an entrance fee but we just pushed through anyways so I actually am unsure how much it was?! It was an 80""s night with all your favorite ""love-to-hate-but-secretly-i'm-a-80's-fan-too"" tracks ! People were in costume which added to the trashyness of it and there were plenty of lounges to park myself down on and take it all in. Fun!!"
4,"My long ambition to get onto more submarines is finally coming to fruition. I've seen 2 in a month! My fascination with these relics of the cold war stems mainly from enjoying ""The Hunt for Red October"" so much. U-434 is a Soviet vessel dating from 1976. She is a Tango-class (NATO designation) attack boat, armed with 24 torpedoes. Powered by 3x 5200 shp 6 cylinder diesels, she was, I believe, the largest non-nuclear submarine in service at the time. A German businessman thought it would be a good idea to buy her for around EUR1M in 2002, and she was transported back from Russia for a further EUR1M and now lies in Hafen City. Admission is around EUR12 with an extra EUR3 for the guided tour, which ou can have in English. I highly recommend the extra tour as you get to see areas of the boat (command room etc.) that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. Sadly, as she was still in active service as a training boat until 5 years ago, the Ruskies removed quite a bit of equipment from her before she was sold. Therefore, you won't be plotting a firing solution as the torpedo computer has gone, along with sonar and communications. For the most part though this is as authentic as it gets. One ping only."
4,"Great place to have dinner eating typical food of hamburg: fish!Nice interior, great and nice service, beer and wine, quick service.For us this evening was the last of a few days in hamburg; a real great finish!"
4,"Roth is a great little cosy pub/restaurant. However, if I'm honest I've never eaten here, so I'm just reviewing it as a pub. They have Rothaus Tannenzäpfle on tap, along with quite a few Irish beers, including Guiness and Murphys, so they have the beer pretty much nailed. The staff are friendly enough, and because of the restaurant side of things you get table service for your beer, which is nice. I'll have to try the food sometime"
4,Very good Mexican cuisine. Portions are large and the food is authentic! Definitely recommend it.
4,"When I first visited HafenBahnhof I was living in St Pauli and quite new to Hamburg - it felt like a very long trip to get there and back. I haven't been back in a long time, but with my now much-more-substantial knowledge of Hamburg, it doesn't feel so far away - especially if you happen to live in Altona or own a bike (cycling around Hamburg is easy). The bar itself is sort of like a big shed (see the photos). They have a small stage at one end for bands, which is actually the only reason that I've ever visited!"
4,"The best baked potato I have eaten. Ever. In my life. And it was cheap too. If i remember correctly it cost something like 3.90 EUR. I highly recommend it to everyone, including people who like me, normally do not like baked potatoes. Me and my friends liked it so much that we went there 3 times in two days!"
1,the lunch pasta here has large portion.
0,Good food but the waiter charged me 3 euro for a glass of water.... not happy at all.
3,"One of my favorite gluten free Italian restaurant in Hamburg! Oh yes, they can make real gluten free food and of course, normal gluten meals. All of them r quite tasty, especially meat dishes and pastas. Absolutely great service, but sometimes because of too many customs eating there. U might need to wait for a while. Love their decoration style and music!"
3,"I like that sushi/japanese place.i live just around the corner now! Since they dont have a wide choice of 'sushi menus' (a pre-selected variety of sushi/maki/sashimi), it would be wise here to order one huge dish for everyone. Whenever i am there with my friends, we try to pick a bit from everything and share the entire plate, or else each one of us would be stuck with a 6 piece roll of the same kind of sushi. And their salads are really good, i specially love the sauce! I havent tried the soup, but i have been told it is also good! I am not a saki expert, but when i had it, i liked it!i liked it even more when i got drunk.We had once ordered 2 sakis (as we were 2 persons there) and the waitress got us two 'kettles' of saki, instead of two glasses. That was A LOT for me! but i enjoyed it :) I will definitely be back there soon..."
3,"Barley & Malt is an Irish pub in the center of Hamburg at the Deichstraße close to the building where the great fire started in 1842. The street is very nice and it is possible to sit outside in the summer. The interior and the decoration are similar to most Irish pubs I have been to. The TV screens show football, rugby or cricket.  The pub offers several snacks and small dishes. I only tried the Nachos which tasted good.To access the pub you need to go up some stairs."
4,"one of the best icecream you can get in Hamburg. very tasteful, Not to sweet, not full of cream as in most stores. no fancy shit just pure taste."
0,"Watch out, they close at random times. After a long slog through the cold and rain, we walked through their front door and were told they're closing at 9:30, even though they normally close at 11. No explanation was given. It was only 9:20 when we got there, but they refused to seat us anyways. I was really looking forward to eating here, so their complete lack of consideration really pissed me off. In spite of their good reviews, they're not worth it."
3,"Dean and David is a nice place to have lunch in the city, as it is located close to the main station. I tried the curry, which was very tasty. The staff was very nice and I liked the interior as well. It is simple but very nice.You need to go up some stairs to get to the restaurant."
4,Excellent tour with lots of sampling along the way. Our guide Christine was hilarious and made sure to get people involved. English tours are given twice a day and all the employees I talked to had very good English. My friends and I loved our chocolate bars that we got to make.
4,yes it really is the best bratwurst in hamburg. ask for an extra roll of bread as theyre very fresh there
4,"CASA FRANCO FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I came here twice with the company I was working for. Since my boss always paid for everything.BUT I'M SURE IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE :D I think if I'd know the prices, I would pretty much give it ZERO stars hahahah. kidding :)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, what we always got was:HUGE SCAMPIES ROASTET IN OIL + ALCOHOL served in huge flamesA PLATE WITH DIFFERENT FISH FILETS + a unique secret sauce made by FrancoSTEAK, small peaces of steak with different sauces.and more.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Honestly I don't remember it all but I know you get a lot, and all the seafood you get are really really delicious.I remember I dropped the whole steak I picked it up and still ate it, that's how good it was. But I was drunk anyways haha.LOCATION: Very very small, I guess about 20 people max. It's great, because it gives you a nice familiar cozy atmosphere.If you have the money and wanna do yourself somethiing good. Come here."
1,"Meh. The broth had little flavor, the noodles were over cooked, and too salty. I've had some great pho other places, maybe Hamburg you should stick to other things."
4,"Crispy duck is so good here!! I've only ever had takeout, while staying at the Park Hyatt in the same mall complex, but they are prompt and the food is delicious. I keep going back thinking I'll try something else, but seats get the same dish.For foreigners, it is cash only (no international cards)."
3,"Good burger, nice restaurant, self-service, price low"
1,Very boring food - tasteless pasta and salat that did not seem fresh. But the staff was very energetic and the location on a side street was very nice.
2,"Welcome to the Auswanderermuseum BallinStadt in Hamburg aka museum about emigrantion.First of all: I will not join the overall praise for this museum. Now, 3 days after I visited it, I still think the quality of the exhibition is pretty mixed.I visited it with friends, both fluent in English and German, and we switched languages depending on which seemed to get us quicker through, because the museum was pretty crowded on the day of our visit.We both had intermediate to advanced knowledge of German history and emigration waves from Germany. I don't know how much you would get our of the exhibition if you are just searching for information where your ancestors are from. That's because the exhibition is pretty inconsistent. Albeit, the general layout makes sense: Situation in Germany and Eastern Europe  Migration waves  Destinations - the development of the ships and the ship passage  Entering the new country (with a special focus on Ellis Island)  Immigration Countries other than the USA/Canada (Brazil, Australia)  famous immigrants who've made it.In another building the history of the BallinStadt is told, with the situation which led to the building of the barracks, their short-lived fate from 1901-1914 and the seemingly even shorter time between WW I and WW II. Plus the story about the back-then CEO of HAPAG, the shipping company that invented ship cruises and got big by shipping immigrants over the Big Pond.About the flaws in the concept:English vs. German:Everything is labelled in English in German, but the German label dominate, the English is always a bit shorter and layouted in a smaller font.Bigger picture vs. individual story:In the beginning you are confronted with six individuals, which should guide you through the exhibition and tell you their story. They literally tell you their story, which might be longer with the one and quicker with the other. Unfortunately you cannot skip  when you dialled the wrong language, you have to wait until they are finished. On crowded days, you have to stand in line, there are only two earphones per puppet, and you can dial only one language at a time for both earphones.And in the end you find out the six individuals don't really guide you through. You just see them back at the end of the exhibition, then they tell you what their life is like not that they are away from home for a couple of month or years. There is no alternative way to find out about their fate, you either wait and here or you don't find out about them.During the different stages of the migration, there are different individuals who show up and just present one piece of information, you don't get informed what their background is, et cetera. So if they already put such an efford in telling an individual's story, why don't they use it to describe the different stages of emigration better?History of BallinStadtThere is a lot of pictures and exhibition objects which are not labelled, and you might only get the meaning of it later on, if you get it.Conclusion:Ok, we learned a lot, and I think for kids it might be funny to run through a ship which changes from early 18th century to early 20th century within a few meters. But there is a lot that is forbidden to touch (not a good idea with kids). The fact that a lot of exhibition objects are not labelled and you might learn to know what it was waaayyy later is annoying.The entrance fee is 12 EUR, which is not cheap. As the museum is not publicly funded, it is heavily sponsored, f.e. by Ancestry.com. This is a bit ironic, because the digitalization of the archieves is publicly funded, so it is a strange kind of private-public partnership."
4,"First time visiting Hamburg and happened upon this gem! This is the most fantastic pizza...I love it...seriously. #likeseriouslybestpizzaeverPros:*As I said, it's one of the best pizzas I've had. Worth every penny.*Quick; ordered when I got there and it was ready in about 10 minutes (no line when I arrived)*Friendly; every employee was kind and had a smile; they were very patient with the ""unsure American"", lol*English-speaking; much to my benefit, the employees spoke English -- I would not have been able to order otherwise.Cons:*small place; not appropriate for a sit-down meal if that's what you want*can be pricy; I got a ""large"" (medium by U.S. standards) with ""all the meats"" (which actually surprised the employees, lol) and paid about 13EUR -- but also like I said, worth every penny!*maybe not the best place/location/area of town for small children*CASH ONLY (I've found this is rather typical around the area in general, but this place only takes cash...be prepared)"
3,"The Hamburg Dungeon is an interactive journey through the dark history of Hamburg, with actors explaining about e.g. Black Death, the great fire or pirate Störtebeker. Within groups you enter room by room, where the actors wait for you. Everything is a little spooky and therefore there is a minimum age of 10 years old to enter the Dungeon. Enjoy!"
3,We had shoyu ramen and miso ramen and they all tasted very good. The shop was very clean with friendly staff and warm atmosphere. I would like to come back to try other flavors such as butter corn or special shoyu ramen. The taste was quite close to what I had in Japan. I wish they have tonkotsu ramen as well.
4,"Einfach unglaublich köstlich, supernette Bedienung und ein urgemütliches Lokal. Volle Punktzahl!"
4,"Just wow... A must see and well really the only main attraction found in Hamburg. It might appear childish at first, but its far from, its a historical masterpiece. Whether you'd like to reminisce over your childhood modeling years, or your world wanderer this exhibition of tiny animated models will take you back. Outside of your personal experience, this would positively impact your child's imagination offering mechanical and historical significance. Prepare for a 3-4 hour visit, there is so much content I'd advise review it in detail. In any case you will miss something. Great for English speaking visitors, and German natives."
4,I go here when I miss Vietnamese food.Only regret is that they do not serve Vietnamese food during lunch hours.
3,"What a night! Went with a group of 11 and were treated to a tapas style meal selected by the owner which included four flavourful seafood courses: sea bass, sword fish, shrimp flambé and Canadian halibut.  A truly authentic Portuguese dining experience including a beautiful acoustic serenade throughout our meal.  Highly recommend."
3,"The Kopiba is also known as ""Deathpresso"" Café.  It's their home brand coffee bean and is alsoactually the big sign outside above their entrance... so don't be confused when ppl tell you they'll meet you at ""Deathpresso""This leads us to the next fact: Kopiba is all about coffee and Espresso and they have an excellent selection of self-roasted coffees to have there and to buy. The staff is always willing to help you select the espresso bean that you want.It's a small café but intimate and cozy. On weekends they serve a breakfast buffet which contains just anything that you will need after your long night out in St Pauli.DO TRY their waffles!!!! They are absolutely amazing!!!"
1,"I'm sure this is a nice place to grab a coffee or sandwich - at least it looks nice - but for me, it was one great disappointment.- The people working pretented to not understand a single word of my English and if they did, they answered in German. They also didn't look at me when talking to me and I basically didn't feel welcome at all.- The breakfast plate I had been so extremely looking forward to ever since I saw the photos both here on Yelp and on Instagram wasn't mentioned on the menu, and when I asked for it I was told that that's only for special occassions or special people (!).+ The caffè latte and little yoghurt bowl with granola I ended up with tasted very good.So Hej papa deserves more than one star because of the food, the location and the cute name ;), but I would never ever go there again. Although, if they'd offer me that breakfast plate.........."
4,This was such an eye opening experience. I would recommend everyone to give this museum a chance and let it show you a different world.
3,"This place serves excellent vegetarian and vegan food and has elegant decor with personalized service. I've eaten here for dinner four times and was very impressed by the quality and taste of all the dishes and wines. I highly doubt there's much better vegetarian/vegan food in the city, so I could highly recommend this place for dinner, although it is pretty expensive.There's a ""special of the day"" card on the first page of the menu. I've always ordered from this and was served very fresh tasting meals as a result, so if there's something you like on here, I think it'd be a good call.There's also free bread served with each meal with a side of bean and thyme spread. The chef brings out the dishes herself, which is a nice touch. Altogether, I really like this place and think you should go here if you want a higher-end vegetarian/vegan meal."
3,"Really enjoyed this local, old world, friendly and unpretentious place!    I was staying at Motel One quite near to this restaurant which made it a perfect short walk.  The Schnitzel with fried potatoes was delicious and filling.  I also had their ""apple pie"" which was more like an apple bread pudding but delightful just the same.  It was busy but not to the point of overcrowded where no table was available. I would definitely return here again."
3,"This is the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Hamburg last week. What a great way to kick off a stint in a new city - with a go-to Ramen spot!My husband and I arrived around 6:40pm on a Wednesday night. It was very busy and we ended up waiting for over an hour for a table for the two of us. After a few minutes of figuring out how the line worked, we added our name to the list.We tried to order gyoza, but they were out. We ordered the fried chicken instead and OMG. It was so juicy and delicious. My only complaint is that we couldn't eat it all, otherwise we wouldn't be hungry for our ramen. For the main course, I ordered the Shio with Egg and Seaweed and my husband ordered the Miso ramen with corn and butter. We were both pleased with the ramen.I can't wait to go again to try out the other types of ramen that they have available!"
4,"I am so happy finding this place through windy day of Hamburg. Despite of its small space and no chair, their food is super satisfying. That day, they only sold two choices of dishes: spaghetti (€7) and lasagna (€12). I ordered spaghetti topped with sorta white fish and tomato sauce. It came with big portion for my late lunch. The fish topping was generous and its sauce is pretty good, not too sour. You can choose some of beverages served. I ordered ingwer-minze-tee because I need hot beverage to reduce the windy effect to my body. I think I chose the right drink because it really boosted my mood. Thanks!!"
3,"I have walked by this place many times, an I guess I was too busy window shopping to notice this restaurant! Breakfast all day?! And I didn't know about it!? That is a crime. I ordered the French Breakfast at 15:00. It came with two buttery croissants, jam, nutella and honey. I had a sweet tooth, and this ""breakfast"" definitely cured it.  The juice was fabulous. Maracuja (passion fruit), orange and strawberry. Unfortunately the little fruit flies also know that they use fresh fruit in their juices, and they enjoy hanging around for a taste.  Will be back, especially to try other juices."
4,The town hall of Hamburg is with his 647 rooms bigger than the Buckingham Palace.Some places of the town hall are only visitable through a guidance. Conclusion:The town hall of Hamburg is very historical and beautiful. It is a visit worth!
4,The best cafe in Hamburg!:) I love and miss that place! I lived in Hamburg for almost 9 years! The owners are a french and the service is very friendly. It's a cute small cafe in Hamburg Winterhude. It's very cozy. They have the best quiche I've ever eaten in my life! The cofffe is perfect and you have to try the Marabou chocolate pie! OMG! I always go there when I visit Hamburg!
4,This is probably the best place for tasty food and amazing cakes in the world! You really need to try the hot cocoa!
4,"By far the best Irish Pub I've visited in Germany so far. The owner is from Dublin, half of the staff is also Irish native. Great pint of Guinness (or as they'd call it ""Perfect Pint""), great atmosphere. Make sure to try the burgers and baguettes, order Guinness and best drop in on a Thursday for the weekly pub quiz (not during the summer) or on a Friday / Saturday for the craic. Also worth mentioning: probably the largest collection of Irish whiskeys I've seen in a pub so far. However, no other than Irish whiskey is served."
2,"Five years I lived next door to Die kleine Konditorei. I could have had these great rolls every day. Every morning and every evening.I could have hadBut I didn't have them every day. Not even weekly. The rolls are okay, but in my opinion it's not the manifestation of rolls worldwide there. Standing in line can be fun, I don't have to tell you. But standing in line over the street for rolls ? Only if you need buying rolls as your first event on a sunny sunday morning. So, dear English-Qype-Community, toast is all right and breakfast without rolls is all right too, even in Germany. But if you are homesick and you want to stand in queue you are welcome!"
4,"(This review is best read in black and white while listening to smooth jazz.)It's like walking into a cliché!Just like there's a moment of eye-pain when you open the blinds a sunny day, there's gonna be a moment of awkwardness when you walk through the door into the super romantic ambience. Just power through. Make joke about it if necessary. Just power through.It's a place designed to get you into a warm fuzzy haze of happiness.Didn't like the chairs though. They're big and bulky, there's too many of them, and I don't like to perform self-origami just to sit down."
3,"Shiso is favorite lunch spot near work. Fun Asian-ish deco inside with a fusion burger menu. The shrimp burger is my favorite and totally dog their fries. If I am not getting the shrimp burger, it can be a hit or miss with the rest. The most common problem being the burger being too smaller than the buns and sliding out with the sauces on the steamer basket. Oh yes, they serve the burgers and fries in steamer baskets, pretty neat!The pineapple mint shake is a must!"
4,"Ich liebe den Elbstrand, schon im Sommer grillen oder picknicken ist schon was schönes. Aber nicht nur im Sommer kann man am Strand spazieren gehen, im Herbst ist es auch ganz schön mit Schatz, ner Decke und nem heißen Kakoa =)"
1,"I definitely see the appeal here. I feel like it's more for the masses...think McDonald's, German style. And actually the burgers and fries do very much taste similar to that of McDonald's, in my opinion anyway. Even the advertising is in line with that of McDonald's as they advertise huge massive burgers, but in reality you get a thin, perfectly cylindrical and over-seasoned hamburger patty, flat mass-produced buns and misc. toppings...but at least it tastes pretty good. Again...think McDonald's but at twice or three times the price wherever you come from.If you are a visitor of Hamburg, please do not believe those that say it's the best in our city! There are many more better offerings in Hamburg.  Overall, 2.5 stars. Will you ever see me there again? Not if it's my choice. I won't deny that I thought it was pretty good, but I was disappointed overall. If anything really, it has seriously deterred me from wanting to try Block House."
3,"I thought this was a great choice for typical northern German dishes.  The dishes we ordered were well prepared, with good quality ingredients (especially the fish).  We tried  labskaus - it may be described in your guidebook as a kind of steak tartare, but this version seemed to be cooked with a bunch of interesting spices, then minced and/or pulverized into almost a paste.  Then it was topped with fried egg and served with beets and pickles.  Definitely uniquely Northern German (you won't find that in a Munich beer hall).   The other starter we ordered was a pea soup -- which was fantastically full of bacon.  For mains we had a flat-fish (like a flounder but I didn't catch the name), served smothered in small local shrimps, and a creamy fish stew, very nicely seasoned and served with potatoes that were absolutely perfectly cooked.  Service was very gracious too."
4,"Really nice Mexican place in the schanze! I was initially worried that I'd not find much to eat on the menu given that spicy food and I don't get along very well, but the staff recommended a few dishes I might like and I wasn't disappointed. I had a really nice mexican sandwich with an omelette and avocado - one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while! Recommended for some authentic mexican food for a decent price in the Schanze."
2,"This is a review for the museum cafe:Free parking. No wifi. Nice atmosphere. Very expensive macchiato which I was charged €2.80 for 200 ml. The average price in Hamburg is €2.30 for 400 ml, so to be charged this amount in one of Hamburg's poorest neighborhoods is out of order. If and only if the cafe's money supports the existence of the museum is this ok. This must be the reason this place is nearly empty at prime time (12:35 pm)."
3,"Really cannot believe it took me so long to try this restaurant! Grabbed take out on a Sunday - and it was de-lish. Next time I will call ahead, but there is no menu online that I am aware of. We had Duck with Peking sauce, Wonton Soup, Chicken Chow Mein and veggie rolls. All good. Looking forward to our next Chinese Sunday pick-up!"
4,"The most Irish Irish pub that I've been to in Hamburg. They pride themselves on the quality of their Guinness, the breadth of their whiskey collection and the standard of their food. I told them I found them on the internet as the top Irish pub in Hamburg, they countered with we're the top Irish pub in Germany! and pointed to a wall of awards. When we approached the bar we were offered two Guinness, almost as if that was the only option. I asked about the other beer available and then decided that it was either Kilkenny or Guinness. I went for Guinness. Next up, choosing some food. Near the front of the menu was Fish and Chips. I love a good fish and chips, but I've not had any since coming to live in Germany (1 year ago). I asked how it was, more meaning what type of fish and chips it was (chippy or restaurant), and was told that it's very good. I was then told that they were so confident in it that If you don't like it, you can have it for free. The Guinness was good. The fish was beautiful. As with all Irish pubs, the prices aren't cheap. A 400ml Guinness is EUR3.70 and the Fish and Chips was EUR10. I'll be back."
4,"We ordered Nouko Ramen, Gyoza, fried chicken, they all taste good, but I can't really tell whether it's because the food or because I'm too hungry, we waited 40min to get the table.Anyway, I will come again. Now, time for ice cream \o/"
4,"Wow! So good! Don't make the mistake I did when I was new in the city and eat at the bus terminal, walk about 5 mins to here and eat like a king. My favorite was Adona kebab."
3,"Are there any beach clubs in the UK? By way of explanation, a beach club is an outdoor bar with a layer of sand across the floor to make it like a beach. Most of these bars are next to rivers or lakes, but not always. Anyway Strand Pauli is the most permanent and generally the closest beach club to the Reeperbahn. The pluses are that the atmosphere is always cool, the seating is good and the view is interesting (so long as you like shipping). The main minus is that the sand is dirty and full of cigarette butts. The beer is kinda expensive, but cheaper than the other beach clubs."
4,"Fantastic burgers!!! Hands down one of the best I've had. The burgers are cooked very well (I recommend medium) with lots of flavors from the portables mushrooms and spinach. Highly recommend the Truffel burger with 1 patty (about 8 euros) with the pale ale beer (about 3.8 euros). The Pommes are excellent as well, you can get 1 to share. Definitely try it out!"
4,"Amazing maritime museum completed in 2008. Extremely comprehensive--  nine stories in all, with sub-floors in-between.  Largest collection of miniature ships ever assembled -- all by the die cast process.  Highlight for me:  Topographic map of the entire planet showing the islands throughout the Pacific -- even Catalina Island.  Topography of South American coastline shows how incredibly deep the drop-off is. The Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas jut out dramatically.  Other highlights:  all types of torpedoes and other naval weaponry.  Also:  WWII periscope -- in working order.  And a huge model of the QE II made out of legos.  I was happier than a pig in sh*t."
4,"The ""Hamburger Rathaus"" is really impressive ! We can see it from far away.I just loved its architecture, particulary its roof with blue tiles.Unfortunately, I didn't had the chance to visit the interior."
3,"Good burgers, but nothing special. The fried were nice as well. Overall, I'd recommend it to watch some sports."
4,Fantastic food at affordable prices in a quick and efficient way. It doesn't get a any better than this for a lunch break.. Oh did I mention there's a great outside area? There is!I had one of the best bolognese pasta dishes here of my life. Yeah. And I didn't had to wait for it I just ordered it quickly and enjoy it. Good selection of local drinks and sodas.Great to eat outside on a sunny and beautiful summer day.
4,"Came here after a long walk around the city.  I sat outside on the picnic tables and ordered the seasonal special... a hamburger patty with white asparagus, potatoes and a big boat of hollandaise.  The best hollandaise I've ever had.  The meal was delicious.  Very friendly people that come here and the locals chatted me up even though I was a tourist.  Hamburg is great"
4,"Seemingly run by a husband-wife combo, this is a really nice little Italian place for lunch. It's a bit imbissy with its high, small tables, but the food is great and a reasonable price. I had a Diavolo pizza and it was the best pizza that I've had in a long time. I'll be back"
4,"Wonderful place. The food was delicious and authentic, and the woman helping us had a great personality and was very helpful (and she spoke excellent English)."
2,"YES VAPIANO IS POPULARYES VAPIANO IS FRESHBut it's overrated. I wouldn't consider this as a restaurant. It's a upscale fastfood chain since you get a card at the entrance to pay your ordered food with. It's a marketing strategy since you pay with a plastic card and not with real money, you lose the awareness of the value.And at the canteen you'll take a tray and after 15 min of waiiting in line hopefully you got your meal.This is not bad at all. I like it crowdy and waiting for someone to free their table so we can sit. No seriously I think it's fun :DThe only thing why I gave it 3 stars is because I'm always still hungry when I leave Vapiano. The dish you order comes with a huge bowl or plate or whatever but the actual food covers only 1/3 of it. And I refuse to order another one.  THAT'S THE CATCH. People order more because one dish is too little.I REFUSE bitches!"
3,"We didn't book a table but they were able to find us a seat instantly in the main room. The resturant has two rooms first as you walk through the door and the section through a corridor with a display showing the special of the day behind a glass display. Both rooms were busy but not over crowded and all staff were very polite and welcoming.The restaurant is very close to a train station and in an alternative arty district.The decor is very urban and industrial but in a very stylish manner. You can tell all the details and artwork was heavily scrutinised and calculated for the right look.After much debate over the menu we ordered two beers and went with the Lamb shoulder for two at 23 Euros each this was one of the cheapest mains on the menu. We ordered two sides Chantellene mushrooms and mashed potatoe with onions.The drinks came quickly followed 20 minutes later with our mains, the lamb was served on a wooden plaque and our dishes were two wooden chopping boards with steak knifes attached by magnet. This was served with mini side salad of which you could choose the dressing and half a corn on the cob. The waitress charved the meat off the bone onto the plaque board then presented this to us on our table.The food was lovely, the meat was very tender and the sides were cooked perfectly and very tasty. We actually didnt need the extra sides as the portion was quite big. The only negative i could give was the price was quite steap however for good quality food, it will never be cheap. The mashed potatoe was fluffy with mini bits of onion and the mushrooms were sauted in butter and herbs. we orded a espresso and jager after the meal and the total was 70 Euro, not cheap but as we were satisfied this was not a problem. I would recommend this resturant but mainly for an occassion to celebrate."
3,"On our first night in Hamburg, our buddies took us to this bar. It was a pretty cool bar. Everyone was friendly, including the staff. We were there for someones birthday party. We chopped it up with Hamburg locals and some folks that were from out of town. Lots of cute ladies. It was a typical bar with the dim lights and music playing in the background to set the mood. I liked the bar except that they allowed smoking, but hey, it is what it is."
4,Nice Italian restaurant in cute neighborhood. Good service freshly made pasta and bread. Very tasty
2,"Not a lot of mexican places in Hamburg.   We went here searching for a fix.Overall service was good.  There is English menu included.   The menu is very simple; 2 pages for food.  More pages for alcohol.   We started with guacamole and it was good.  Hubby thought it was a little too Limey but he was eating every bit of it.  And it seemed homemade.  We had a lime margarita and mango margarita.  For price, it was pretty small but it tasted pretty good, maybe too much tequila (not exactly a bad thing).  Kids had cold milk.   My hubby asked for true mexican beer (dos Equis Amber, negro modelo which were on menu) but they were out.  They did have corona and German beer.The kids has the burrito with queso.  Considering the price and 3 tortillas, we had them split.  The tortillas were small, corn, and ultimately not a very large serving.  It also was covered in salsa.I had burrito with chicken with green salsa.  Overall it was good but was made with corn tortillas and small.  Taste was good though.   Hubby had enchiladas with beef and mole.   Again corn (more expected) and he was happy with mole.We ended dinner with their only dessert which was plantains in honey and cream. It was ok....  Not my thing.Considering the choices, it was okay for our fix.  Guacamole and a margarita were my favorites.    Also there weren't a lot of people there on a Saturday night.  Btw, they open at 6pm and hard to park."
3,"My wife and I haven't eaten at too many Italian restaurants in Hamburg since we first moved here, but enough to feel like pizza here just isn't very good. It seemed like most restaurants liked to reheat some version of a frozen pizza or just some other variety that just didn't taste authentic, or really very good for that matter.We were beginning to lose hope, thinking that we had to travel to Italy constantly to get good pizza (which obviously isn't a bad thing at all, especially since plane tickets aren't too bad from here). For the times we don't feel like leaving Hamburg but really want pizza, Grazie a Dio for Luigi's! It's the best tasting pizza we've tried, and the most authentic thus far in Hamburg.  All of the pizzas are very good (especially the pizza parma) and cooked in a large indoor wood-fired oven! I love that! Lunch menu portions, which are served around 12pm to 3pm Mon. - Fri. are just the right size per person at an awesome deal of 5€ per person with a small drink. Off-weekday-lunch hours the pizzas are almost double the price, but also probably 1.5 times the size...so there's that. My wife and I actually struggled to finish two pizzas on a lovely summer afternoon in Hamburg and had to box about a half of a pizza to take home. We will continue to try new pizza places throughout our new home, but we're glad to know that we have a really good place to come back to again and again."
4,"I loved it! So much food, friendly staff, cool environment! But don't forget to make a reservation."
3,"Popped in here the other day when my staple in the area was unexpectedly closed. The Roosen is a cute lil' place - the sofas are well comfortable, service is very friendly (albeit a tad hover-ey), drinks are well prepared and the price is right (4.50 for a caipirinha sounds like my cup of caipirinha!). Would love to come back here - a really nice place to kick back early and drink yourself through the evening on a weeknight with some good company. One star off for the kind of toilets you don't want to visit when you're a tad tipsy - the trip down will send you into a spin!"
4,"Really great experience, wonderful food and large portions, truly welcoming with the owner's  greeting and seating people. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
4,"Very flavorful kebab and rice! The soultani is well cooked, overall well done but still very moist. Served with mint and onions, as well as flatbread. Very reasonably priced about 14.50 euros for soultani, about 2.80 for each drink. Served very fast! Good Persian music playing in the background and elegantly decorated."
3,"Being an Indian on a business trip to Hamburg, my joy knew no bounds when I came across Shikara which was close to the hotel in Altona. Just because of the Indian connection, there was an instant liking to this place when I walked in the first time.The staff is extremely courteous and made food as per our request even though it was not in the menu. The taste of the food again was made for our Indian tongues and we kept going back to the same restaurant every few days!Food - 8/10Ambiance - 9/10Staff - 10/10Value for money - 7/10 (Didn't matter much to me since I was on a business trip!)My suggestion for improvement: since I am from South India, I would love to see more South Indian dishes in the menu. Apart from that tiny rant, this restaurant is one of the best Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood and certainly worth a couple of visits for sure!"
4,"Wonderful new little cafe serving home cooked food and thoughtfully sourced coffee and teas. The owners are kind and passionate about the quality of the ingredients they use, which hasn't gone unnoticed by locals as they regularly sell out of what they have on offer. There are also items from their family farm for sale and free wifi :)"
2,I was a bit disappointed by the breakfast on offer but the cakes were good. Coffee not so good. Very nice mood though and lovely interiors.
4,Simply stated- the best service in Hamburg. Always a friendly and accommodating staff and the food is consistently very good.
3,"Just in terms of the art of plating, this restaurant is easily in the top 10 of all time that I have ever dined at or experienced. Every dish was exceptionally photo-worthy, from multiple angles, and literally compelled you to take out your smartphone and photograph it. Simply put, our dinner was art on a plate. The food here also had many different flavor profiles and flavor combinations that would test the range of many people's palettes. The cuisine is French-Moroccan. Some could easily find it odd or mis-matched. I appreciated it because it was something new and often had me saying ""hmmm...interesting...good, but very different.""Seven courses per person were a bit on the pricey side -- moths flew out of my wallet after I paid the bill -- but it was a wonderful celebration dinner that night, all in all, for multiple reasons.If you really want to taste something a little bit different, bold, new or refreshing, where the food is beautifully plated, then this is the place."
3,"We tried the brand new American Brunch this past Sunday morning. Being an American I am usually fairly skeptical about anything advertised as ""American"". We arrived at 11 am and had our choice of tables inside or out. It was a breezy morning and we sat on the shady side of the house. (There isn't a sunny side this time of morning at the Chilehaus!) Cushions and blankets made the hard wood benches very comfortable. Our order was taken promptly by a friendly waiter and off we went to the buffet. I was quite happy to see pancakes and bacon as well as two types of eggs (scrambled and soft boiled). For the Brits there were sausages and beans, as well. The ""make your own"" waffles were a big hit with my kids and husband. The buffet also had the typical German breakfast items, such as Brötchen, assorted breads and toast bread, cheeses, meats, jams, jellies, cream cheeses, yogurts, etc. I also enjoyed the more lunch-y items: chili, wraps and steamed veggies. All of us finished our brunch off with a giant portion of fresh fruits. The food was good, well-prepared and quickly replenished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The brunch costs just under 15€ and includes a prosecco, a warm drink and an orange juice - quite a bargain, I think. My one and only suggestion would be to put out those mini glass bowls for the maple syrup. We will surely go back again!"
4,"This bar is just what the Grindelhof area needed: Hosting a very mixed crowd consisting of mainly students during day-time, at night, the PONY BAR also draws visitors from next door Abaton movie theatre. Honest prices and a good variety of drinks, sweet snacks and music - most of what needs to be said can be found in all the other entries. Here's the clue: Every wednesday night, there's Live-Jazz. Buggy Braune, one of Hamburg's most well known current jazz pianists, hosts a night of Cool and Modern Jazz, Swing, Be- and Hardbop along with his students from the Hamburger Hochschule für Musik und Theater. It's usually a classic jazz trio or quartet. Playing for free, the guys show that it's all about making music. Feel it. If Buggy's off for some other business, some student takes over his Fender Rhodes and puts the keys on fire. Starts at 10:30 p.m. Check ahead for night buses."
3,"Fun spot! Great views of the Hamburg Hafen and City. For the location and dress code the prices are reasonable. We had a lovely waitress and the drinks were perfectly mixed. A table may be hard to come by as this spot becomes more and more popular, so even on a Monday night it may be best to call ahead."
3,"Qrito: Original Californian Cuisine. They have burritos, quesadilla and tacos which you can fill with a wide choice of meat.Either with minced meat, finely chopped meat, orange/lime chicken, chocolate/nuts beef, and of course pork meet. Rice is also added, either lime or spanish, and a variety of vegetables and a sauce of your choice. It's a nice place, with an original idea.The Burrito and Quesadilla are HUGE. you need to be really hungry to eat it up!"
4,"Best burgers in Hamburg!! Cheesecake is also amazing. Huge portions if you order burgers with fries (I never finish it all, but you can order without fries) and a nice selection of drinks. Burgers have english muffin buns...otherwise authentic toppings (also made to suit your taste) and ""eat with your hands"" instructions on the menus :) Reserve seats for a weekend meal. Friendly atmosphere."
4,"Germans are known around the world for their excellence in engineering and attention to detail, and nowhere is that more effectively on display than Miniature Wunderland. Every last bit of the models is breathtakingly designed, and each section is filled with hidden details and Easter eggs. Some highlights include:* The entire place has a day/night cycle, complete with sunsets, colored lights, and every last car, building, and street lamp lighting up in sync with the cycle.* There's a river in one of the areas that has a remote-controlled boat in it, complete with tides achieved by pumping water in and out of the river in sync with the day/night cycle.* The Hamburg airport has a perfect replica, complete with takeoffs, taxiing, landings, and a working departure/arrival board.* Each display is filled with buttons that cause rocket launches, open buildings, prompt volcanic eruptions, and more!* The roads are full of cars and trucks that actually move and obey traffic lights.You can easily spend hours here ogling over every detail. I lost count of the number of times I said ""wow"" out loud. If you're touring Hamburg, just go. You won't regret it, not even a little."
3,"Good place for a quick stop for some seafood. Fresh fish, nice staff, authentic place, and good prices. What else can you ask for?"
4,best rolls in town! check kleine-konditorei.com
3,"In German, 'kekse' sounds like 'cakes' but really means cookies, so when I first walked past the happykappy--a store clearly specializing in cupcakes--well, I just had to try. I'll bet they are really just muffins disguised as cupcakes, I mumbled to The Mexican as we ducked inside. No, no oh no. They where, in fact, the real-deal. Perhaps overly-sweet for the typical German pallet, these babies are pure pastry porn: big on size, taste and a bit on price. But hey, this is not the corner Bäckerei--unless your corner baker is Lewis Carroll. If you never had a cupcake, this is where you go in Hamburg to try one. If your alcoholic friend is throwing a dinner party, a box of cupcakes makes a good backup to the gift of wine. And if your girlfriend is a sex-in-the-city nut: consider the seduction factor of these cupcakes: beautiful, edible fashion."
3,"Cool bar in between St. Pauli and the Schanze. They sell Pilsner Urquell pretty cheap and have a cool open mic night, which is what I was there for. The only drawback with this place is that it's a little bit isolated."
4,"Awesome German food! A few nice Schnitzels to choose from (incl. a beer crust and a pretzel-breaded Schnitzel), as well as other pasta and meat specialties. Nice high-class brewery atmosphere  speaking of which, their beer is excellent. Fair prices as well, and a very central location. Friendly waitstaff. One of my favorite German food places in Hamburg!"
3,I love Campus Suite franchise. after the Balzac this is my favorite place to hangout in the morning. Campus have really low prices and quite good snacks which are even better than Balzac's. Lots of stuff for Bio & Eco lovers.
3,"Chouette endroit en effet, la rue est jolie, une clientèle brassée et ma foi sympathique, service gentil, bons cocktails quand le barman est là et bonne surprise chaque fois : les prix sont très modérés. Mon chouchou : les pizzas sont excellentes, vous savez, celles avec des ingrédients frais et à pate fine. C'est simple, je ne mange jamais de pizza en dehors de chez moi, exception faite pour Gloria. Ce soir sur la carte, une pizza chèvre miel et poire, un délice! Sinon la Rucola Parma Schinken, très bonne aussi. Tables en terrasse toujours bondées à partir de 15 degrés ;-) c'est typique de Hambourg! De toutes façons, on est mieux assis à l'intérieur."
0,"Terrible! Probably the worst T-Bone steak I've ever had. It shouldn't even be called T-Bone steak. The staff is weird as well. Avoid this place -- definitely not worth your money. Block House, Meatery and Schlachterbörse may cost a bit more, but are totally worth the money. FAIL!"
4,"So good. This is my second trip to Hamburg and my second time here. Came originally because my gf had raved about their lentil soup, and she's right to do so - it's the best. The pide and lahmacun are delicious. And the main dishes are outstanding. Today I had the yogurt kabab and it was great. Chill vibe, friendly staff, good prices, fantastic food."
4,"Still the best Italian place in Hamburg, together with other Vapiano's around the city. There are so many copycats lately coming out but this place keeps the standard very well and everytime when we go there it's a special enjoyment. Everything here tastes good, pizza, pasta, salads, bread..."
2,"We thought it was a regular sit-down type of restaurant when we first popped in before we realized it was just a much nicer fast food burger joint than we had back home. The menu isn't super descriptive and I don't speak German, but I was able to make out some of it from the online menu and photos.I got the regular size (one patty) JB Champignon, which came with mushrooms, cheese, and sautéed onions. I decided to make it a combo with their freshly made lemonade and garlic bread instead of fries, because I had never seen it as a side to a burger before (not thinking there would be an excessive amount of bread). I'm a big eater but the burger turned out to be larger and wider than I had expected, so I was glad I only got the one patty instead of two. These are the kind of burgers you might want to eat with a fork and knife! The burger also came with lettuce and, unexpectedly, this creamy, mayo-based type of sauce, which was good but got to be overwhelming and very heavy near the end. I ended up scraping some of the sauce off the bun and then later gave up on the bun to eat most the garlic bread instead.Like some other restaurants in Europe, my husband had to pay extra for ketchup, which was their own chain brand that came in a big packet. I also took a couple sips of his Fritz-kola, which is a soda brand made in Hamburg. My husband was also very stuffed with meal (I think he got a two-patty JB BBQ, but I can't remember).We were both really impressed with some of the people around us who were licking their plates clean. It seemed to be a pretty good bang for your buck, though more expensive for us in general with the conversion rates from Canadian into Euros. Clean washrooms, quick and fast service, less waste because of the real cutlery and plates they give you - I can see why this place/chain is so popular!"
0,"Arrived at 7:30pm Saturday with family of 4.  Noticed about 4 tables seated with local Germans.  Despite plenty of empty tables available, we were told ""restaurant is full""...apparently Americans are not welcomed here.  Racism at its worst in a progressive metropolitan area"
3,This wasn't very peaceful place to eat a lunch because the tables were near to each other and the place was full. But I didn't mind anymore as soon as I saw the prices! I didn't know that it's possible to eat fish so cheap... I had my suspicions until I tasted my salmon with peppersauce and it was purely delicious. The salmon was well done and I definitely recommend everyone else taste it as well.
2,"I enjoyed a lunch here with some coworkers. The environment is really nice, it looks like a typical German restaurant. The location is really good, basically in the city center, you can easily reach it from the U-Bahn. The quality of food was good, I took a ""Jägerschnitzel"". Unfortunately, the service was a bit low. They took more than 30 mins to deliver the dishes..."
4,"Excellent customer service, great wine selection. Altogether pleasurable dining experience"
3,Great food and very attentive staff. Very good price level. Best to book in advance.
3,"Great sandwiches, and in general their bread and cheese plate was a perfect start to a Sunday. Their barista was good too. It was hustling and bustling with people. I enjoyed having food and people watching :)"
3,"I'm not from Hamburg, but it seems to be a cool coffee house, with reasonable prices! Our couchsurfer took us there, and he knows the people running this joint. I took a red tea which was good. The Sunday brunch seems tasty and diverse. Since I am a vegan, I didn't find much to eat there, therefore didn't order it. I would be happy to see some more vegetables and maybe avocado or something that us vegan can eat."
3,"I had the Labskaus, I think a Hamburg dish that looks like boiled beef and has the consistency of mashed potatoes. The restaurant and food are fine, but more notable is the street where it's located. My coworker tells me Deichstraße is one of the oldest streets in Hamburg, and the origin of the big fire of 1842 that burned down half the city. You can sit out front if the weather's nice, or take one of the alleyways around back for a great view of the canal and surrounding architecture after dinner."
2,"Well, what can I say? Borcher's is the place you went to in the 80s when you were fed up with all that neon shit.In exchange you got some tavern-like wood furniture, with lame and boring folks.Nothing no changed here since the 80s. Even the music - I mean: SOLID AS A ROCK blaring from the speakers. C'mon, seriously?Hadn't tastes other than their home brewed beer, which is okay."
3,Tasty and fair prices. One of my favourite places for sushi in hamburg!
3,"ruehrei war lecker, orientalisches Fruehstueck haette groesser ausfallen koennen"
4,"Everytime when we have non-Hamburg guests, we would invite them for some German dishes at Schweinske! It was my first time today at the Reeperbahn branch & it was better than I expected. Spacious, clean & the waiters are friendly. In general, love their schnitzels!"
4,"This restaurant is one of the top of the range in this district. They are not only can cook, they can also present their dishes very very nice. I'm wondering how they can have so much new ideas to cook all the time, like a magic hand.Of course you have to pay a bit more with those comfortable environment, sitting and so on but it is worth."
3,"Wanted to come here for some time and finally had a chance to stop in. First off, and most importantly, the coffee is damn good. We had large cappuccinos and both us had some cake. One was a brownie type thing with white cream somehow on top and the other was a double-chocolate mousse type thing. Basically, we were complimenting the coffee the whole time and really enjoyed it. Strong flavored with just the right amount of whipped milk and really well balanced. I'm super anal about coffee and have a top-of-the-line machine at home and buy good coffee which I grind myself. This is the first place in Hamburg where I would say the coffee is comparable or better to what I can make for myself at home. The cake on the other hand was pretty good but not amazing. My brownie thing was a bit too sweet. The chocolate mousse thing was kind of bland. Unfortunately, I found the sizing also on the small side. I don't like when you get a piece of cake that is half a kilo but when it's tiny I feel scammed a bit. The sizing needs to be increased a bit. I also found the crowd a bit odd in terms of it basically being Schanzen yuppies but they're easily zoned out and I liked the room and atmosphere in general. Plus it was sunny and you can sit nicely outside in front of the door. Anyway, do come and try this place out if coffee is your thing."
3,"Great vegan restaurant. The food is tasty, the place is cosy and the crew is cool. Best vegan quiche I ever eat !  The blueberry pie is great too.The missing star is for the really slow service : 40 minutes to get my dish."
3,"If you are in any kind of hurry, just go ahead and avoid this place. We had all the time in the world on Sunday morning so were okay with food taking quite some time. It's a neat little breakfast joint that reminds me of several places we've gone to and loved back in the States. We both got the 3-egg scramble with toast and home fries. My husband got tomatoes, mozz, spinach and mushrooms and I got sun-dried tomatoes, feta and spinach in mine and we both loved our dishes. Kinda nice that you can get as many veggies inside as you want! The jam served with the toast was delicious, as were the home fries. It was nice to see a menu with eggs different ways (especially eggs Benedict!). I don't even know the last time I had fresh OJ, so that was also a pleasant surprise! We both said we would come back here and recommend it to others, as well."
3,"Tasty place if you are looking for Vietnamese street food place. Simple but cozy interior. Friendly service, what else do you expect? Prices are very fair and the dishes are full of flavor."
1,"Would love to give them a higher rating but the carrot quiche that we had was TERRIBLE. I have no doubt that because we were the Americans we were subjected to what we were told was ""the last of the quiche"" and ""the only quiche available"" was the carrot quiche. The gentleman ahead of us had ham and the 4 people that came in after us also were given the option of ham, of course they took ham. Awful, awful, awful"
4,"Yes, I love this place, even though I thought I ordered meat on my pizza, but ended up with peppers instead. Oh well, I guess something got lost in translation. (my own bad). You can choose from various ingredients and combine your own pizza. Superb! Pizza tasted good, nice crunch to it and the pizza sauce was a nice surprise! Price was ok as well. Its just a little walk from Reeperbahn, so not far from public transport. Would love to have a place like this as my neighbour. Free wifi as well."
4,"Super friendly staff that made you feel like you were in Italy until you stepped back out in the Hamburg rain. The pizza was amazing and I managed to finish one on my own, which is rare, but it was so good I simply couldn't stop."
3,"Kebap shop with a  much wider menu than just kebaps. Great outdoor seating with lots of sun; on a sunny day. Additionally, they give you a free salad and bread with your order. I don't know how the kebaps are but I got a dish consisting of lamb, a yoghurt sauce and little chunks of bread, topped with a pretty hot chili. Absolutely delicious. The yoghurt was just adequate to balance the powerful flavour of the lamb. The food also gets prepped very quickly. Definitely a fan of this place for a quick bite"
3,Tischreservierung total versemmelt :-/ aber sonst wie immer sehr gut.!!!
2,Very simple Asian imbis with afordable prices. You can eat and drink well for under 7EUR. Staff is quite friendly but if you are one of those people who can't stand spicy food than this place is not reccomendable. Almost everything there is made of chilli.
1,"We were walking around looking for somewhere for a quick snack and popped in to this cool looking restaurant. After ordering food and drinks we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. There where 5 other occupied tables and three waitresses but nothing seemed to happen. I started timing. Ten minutes after we ordered, we were told the drinks they would be with us shortly. They arrived five mins later with the food. (Quick tip: ALWAYS bring the drinks ASAP and ALWAYS before the food- that way it's more likely that a second drink will be ordered; thus making more money and maybe more tips.)The food however was good and the portions large but nothing out of this world. Cute inside. Quite highly priced but OK if you're not expecting much. Large terrace and a good place to ""be seen"" if thats what you're into.Wouldn't  recommend too highly."
2,"Staff here are really super friendly! They seem serious about their coffee with lots of options on the menu.But it's not a cozy or comfortable place where I'd want to hang out for long, a second drink etc..My non-coffee drink (chai latte) was rather lukewarm, flavour on the dull side. The many happy Yelp voices suggest that coffee drinkers might be luckier here."
4,"Some weeks ago, we noticed that this Vietnamese restaurants is full of people and tried it ourselves  result: best in town! Since my last trip to Vietnam, I haven't had such good soup noodles (Pho) which becomes even more tasty the colder it gets outside. The summer role and dry noodles (Bun) are also very authentic. Besides, they offer a few different dishes every week as well as some interest drinks. Price-wise: EUR 6,50 for a full bowl of noodles  very reasonable! The team is friendly and in very good control of the full house (people often cue outside but the food doesn't take long at all). We are now a frequent visitor at this place and look forward for next quick fix between shopping or after work."
4,"Was awesome. Packed, inexpensive, a lot of food had the vegetarian thali. May go back tomorrow for lunch!"
4,Excellent! Once of the best Thai meals I've had outside of Thailand.
4,"It is, in fact, as good as they say it is. After hearing for years about how great the bread in Germany is, I've been disappointed now that I actually live here. All of the bakeries seem to churn out the same crappy, lifeless, factory-made bread (and/or pastry). Not so at this bakery.I happened upon Die Kleine Konditorei by happenstance; my mechanic is nearby, and I needed something to do for 30 minutes while they worked on my car. They pointed me here, and I will be forever grateful.I was surprised at first to see a line out the door when I arrived on a random Tuesday morning. In my experience, Germans don't queue for anything, so this must be a good spot. I tried the most German croissant I could find... a sunflower seed pretzel croissant, and it was amazing. I also had a tiny little cheese/bacon puff that looked good (and was).Anyway, delicious baked goods, good prices, long lines. Seems worth it to me. I'll be back."
4,"Stopped by for lunch to realize that the dining room was closed (didn't plan ahead) so we made dinner reservations on the spot. It was mid-week and they were pretty much booked but we snagged a spot for a late-ish dinner.While we waited for our table (we were early), we enjoyed well-prepared cocktails at the bar. Were seated after a very short wait, drinks in hand. Ordered the Entrecôte which comes with corn on the cob, a salad, and your choice of one sauce or butter. I also opted to add a side dish of Kartoffel Röstzwiebel Stampf--a warm, savory, and buttery potato and onion mash which rounded out the meal quite well. Steaks were tender and perfectly cooked, portions were fair, and service was prompt and friendly. Chimichurri sauce was a bit bland but the herb butter was lovely. The house red wine was priced modestly and complemented the steak very well. The table next to us  ordered the ""surprise"" three course meal which consisted of a salad, fish with vegetables, and ice cream dessert. It appeared tasty and they seemed to enjoy it. The space is vast and open with low backed booths and wide and comfy chairs which makes it easy to observe what's going on all around. It's a bit loud, but tables are large enough to give each party enough space. Restaurant is busy, but the bustle isn't intrusive and staff was pleasant across the board. Location is convenient and the restaurant is easy to find. Experience was overall very positive and we're glad we checked it out."
0,The Dim sum was ok but the main dish Sweet and Sour was terrible . Cheap low quality chicken. The sauce was not made with love either and for 11.90 a real joke
3,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Sagner's, and tried the northern German specialty labskaus.  The restaurants was a short walk from my hotel, and also was totally local. Luckily they had English menus, and the hostess was quite helpful and could speak English. I also sipped on a tasty local beer. Well priced also."
3,"Met a good friend here for a coffee. It was Sunday and packed and rightly so! The coffee was very good and the atmosphere was very nice, not quite what I expected from the area. I did not try any of their food offerings, but the nice man next to me seemed to truly enjoy his chocolate cake. I also noticed that they had a Brunch Bar out, and that families were helping themselves to the emptying selection (it was after 13:00). Looking forward to my next time back! Check it out if you are in the area!"
3,"Very nice experience!  The food was surprisingly fresh tasting for a chain.  The salad was good, I highly recommend when getting a sandwich or a soup (as I did) adding the salad for and extra euro.  Everything can be taken to go!  Something I have noticed becoming the ""new trend"" in gastronomy in Hamburg.  I can remember when even coffee was never served in a togo cup!Dean & David was great! Nice location and decor.  Free Wifi if you are looking for a nice place to get some work done!Check it out!"
4,High recommended persian restaurant!!!Staff: very friendly and entertaining (5/5)Location: traditional and inviting (4/5)Food: I had the chicken with rice and it was superb!!! (5/5)
4,Loved the hipster vibe + the awesome coffee. Friendly staff and generally great atmosphere. Would have come back for more if only I had stayed longer in town!
2,"This has been on our list to try based on the reviews. Sadly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the sushi. My hubby and I ordered the echtasien Mix II, so we can try a variety of rolls. The platter comes with 2 maki, 2 special rolls, 4 nigiri, 6 sashimi and 2 shrimp tempura. It sounds like a lot but the rolls are rather small and we didn't leave dinner too full, i.e. I could've eaten more. There weren't many choices for the special rolls since they had to be under 9€ for the mix platter. The food came out fast, which was awesome. The quality of fish seemed good, but the rolls fell apart really easily.Our waiter was really nice, the restaurant itself felt warm and cozy even though it is quite big, and it's located in a nice area. It would be a nice place for a date night. The quality and pricing of food was not comparatively better than other sushi restaurants we've been to, though. Perhaps the non-sushi dishes are good, but I don't think I would come back here just for the sushi."
2,Discent burger restaurant whom also serve a salads - the Cesar salad comes without any chicken so you have to order that on the side (well most of the salads is without protein :-))Would have loved to taste there dessert unfortunately there where no hot chocolate left when we finished our main course. They have home made drinks (non alcoholic) which is very good.
4,"FANTASTIC! Loved it! My husband and I went there for lunch about 2 weeks ago and we were both very pleased with our pizzas. I was able to get a vegan pizza, he was able to get a meat pizza. Both of us gobbled up the whole thing."
3,I really liked the cherry chocolate gelato.
3,"I love the french toast with maple syrup and fresh freuit. for 5,00€ i think it is a pretty good deal.I'm tempted to try out the salads but I know that my bill will be a LOT more expensive. but I'm sure it is all very delicious!the place is always PACKED on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/Brunch... if you don't reserve, you might not have a chance.my only disappointment is that they list red velvet cupcakes on their website as a kind of the baked goods, but I've been there several times and they never have them available. :-(  whyyyy?!?!  i would be so many and so often. ;-)"
4,"Proper Irish  to the point that as an Englishman who grew up in the 70s and 80s I always feel a bit unwelcome. But that is definitely me, not them, so we come here often and if you want guinness, irish stew or great soup it's really good here. They also run a briliant Quiz night and often have irish music going on."
4,Best sushi ever! Really fresh. The tuna sashimi! Nomnonnomnomnonnomnnmmm! Really nice Staff! It was saterday and nog even half full.. they really not deserve that ! Good price for good  what Else do you want?
4,"So we wanted to check this museum out so badly because we had read so many good reviews and heard great things about their collections.  And then vacation happened and we almost ran out of time to see it at all.  But...we had to at least go see the special Dali exhibit that they currently have there.  So glad we did!  If you are a Dali fan, you will love this one.  I wish I could say I saw lots more of their permanent collection but I didn't.  We had to browse through in about an hour and that is nowhere near enough time to see it all.  We knew we were going to miss loads so we mapped out the major pieces/exhibits that we wanted to see the most.  If I make it back to Hamburg I will have to go here first thing and give it a proper tour.  They have a really lovely building and have built an amazing collection."
3,"To be totally honest i don't come here to eat. I come for the beer!For the huge (1L) mass beer!And their pretzels! Lovely 'Oktoberfest themed' pub.I've been there only by night. on the week ends its always packed. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in a typical bavarian costums.There's also live music, typical german folkoric music, that i as a non-german dont know, but still dance to! It's a great place, especially if you're out of town or you have visitors."
4,"I was staying locally and asked a taxi driver for a recommendation, this place was it.  I had already noticed Urfa as it was always busy and the food looked so good.  Lots of locals, a really mixed group in this part of town, all enjoying some amazing food.  The service was chipper and the atmosphere quite different to any other kebab place I had eaten in. The meat was tender and tasty.  I could taste charcoal on the chicken and it was perfect.  As was the lamb.I really, heartily recommend Oz Urfa."
1,Service is good after a little waiting time you get seated! Burgers don't take long. Ordered a rare farmers burger but got a burger grilled well done. After asking if that's the rare burger they just said sorry this happens when it's busy. That's it...Beer is alright. Sides are good.
2,"We went here twice in one day!  For dinner was actually because a handful of other restaurants seemed to be closed and we wanted a menu with a variety of menu options.  Earlier that Monday the whole team went here for lunch.  My german team told us that the pizzas here are huge, so one of my collagues and I shared a caprese pizza (they gave us both one half).  I enjoyed the fresh table bread they provided.  Service during the day was better than when we went at night.  The caprese pizza was alright, but had just one small little ball of mozzarella and one teeny basil leaf on each slice.  I would have expected more.  As others have mentioned, the toppings are on the sparse side.  I also ordered a side salad, so I only ended up eating one slice of pizza and taking the rest to go.When we came back for dinner later that night, they were very busy but we were able to get a table by the door.  I had ordered a tomato shrimp gnocchi dish, the girls had ordered an artichoke cream soup and a special crawfish pasta.  We all ended up sharing even though my main dish was the gnocchi.  The portions here are huge again, even more so with the pasta.  The gnocchi were very pillowy and filling.  I actually enjoyed the light cream sauce crawfish pasta more, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish.  And the artichoke cream soup was refreshing.  Again, since they were so busy, we had to keep asking for several things.  But it's honestly not a bad option for a cheap Italian meal.  Dishes top around 12-13 Euro."
4,Pretty good authentic Chinese restaurant not far from the water and the piers. I felt like it was in a quieter part of town as it was in the opposite direction of most of the popular/touristy areas. Decent sized restaurant and our group went at the perfect time. It was mid day during the week and it was not busy at all. We sat at a table with a lazy suzy which is great for groups so everyone can share. The food was good and it was authentic. There were a few European twists but that is to be expected. I had the fried rice and a brisket noodle soup. Everyone shared our dishes as well and everything that I tried was good.
2,"Your typical Irish bar. Probably the most authentic in Hamburg. Very traditional interior. Dark lighting so a good place to come and hide. Very friendly service. The beer's good. Location is easy to reach right on Grossneumarkt. There's outdoor seating during the warmer months. I've only tested some of their food and it was always good. Nothing spectacular but definitely enjoyable. The only thing I really dislike about this place is that at times it can be really full and there isn't that much seating available inside. Further, service can be a bit slow at times and is often pre-occupied with chatting at the bar as opposed to keeping glasses full. If you're into the Irish thing though a perfect jaunt for you in Hamburg."
3,"Very friendly waiters and pleasant atmosphere. Some Dim Sum were tasty, some you need to get used to. But if you didn't try out Dim Sum before, this place should be a good start."
3,"I really enjoyed this, geeky as it may be. There's zero hype, and not much education happening. Basically, you're walking on your own through a good portion of a real submarine, free to poke and prod. If that appeals to you, have at it! But take it from me, watch your head. The doors are low at the top, and high at the bottom, and generally have pipes just where you want to stand up after passing through. (Probably not a good outing for a first date.)"
1,"Too expensive, poor food, really bad service. Nothing new in this part of town. They truly did their best to fullfill the low expectations for this part of town. Basically the majority (actually all) restaurants I'm the area are quite bad. Some are just less bad but none can be defined as really good. It peeves me that they get away with it because of all the tourists who come through here. Anyway, another reminder to remember not to eat in this part of town. Only place even worth considering is Taparia. Forget the rest."
4,"OMG! I never thought I will have multiple orgasms in a museum (almost). For everybody whose heartbeat goes up from fast racing cars, it's a must see. Absolutely professional presentation, and even interesting for kids (but you have to watch them constantly so that they don't touch the cars). Toilets, nappy changing room are also top class. Otherwise quiet and relaxed atmosphere, you can take your time to explore the past and present of the fastest racing cars of the world."
4,This place is amazing! Delicious German cuisine. We had the Spätzel with meatloaf and the Maultaschen with egg. We are going back on Sunday before we return to Copenhagen.
2,"Food was good, but there are literally wasps in the food containers.  Not sure if this will affect people with allergies, but the wasps are literally crawling on the food, and it seems that the staff doesn't care.  That's what I interpreted it as at least."
2,"Traditional swabian comfort food. Not a lot of options in menu.We took lentils and Spätzle. The lentils mash had nice flavor to it, but the Spätzle just felt like raw pasta which wasnt that interesting. We also took German dumplings (Maultaschen). I was not a fan though my friend was. The soup was good though.The desert (some apple pancake with vanilla ice cream, forgot the name) was surprisingly very good. All ingredient completed each other.Also keep in mind the place is very small with only a few tables."
2,"I found the place a bit over-priced for what you get. Standard Thai food without that extensive a menu. Further, service was mediocre at best. No one went the extra mile and it was default all night. Lots of people have already spoken well of the location and ambiance. I'd say it's good but not outstanding. There are better views of the harbor as well as in the Hafencity. Finally, I found the bathrooms to not be that clean. I was already there pretty late in the evening but if you are going to charge these prices, make sure someone is regularly keeping the washrooms tidy. I probably wouldn't go back, mostly due to the pricing for average Thai food. It's worth checking out though if you must do something in the Hafencity and you like Thai. Maybe we just hit a bad night for the chef."
4,"A wonderful authentic German resturaunt. The cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and accomdating staff make for an outstanding experience. Do make a reservation!"
3,"Great bar, with a crowd which can be most aptly described as resembling ""Shoreditch without the skinny jeaned, floppy haired, fixed gear riding wankers"". Really chilled atmosphere, lots of comfortable sofas, and reasonably priced drinks (2.5EUR for an Astra). Deserves special mention for being the first bar I've visited that sported a semi-conscious dog lying at the feet of its owner!"
3,Really good food. Service was slow but other wise OK. The biggest downside was the lack of English menu.
3,"Almost one of ""must-visits"" in HH due to very central location, nice schnitzels and great beer."
4,"I have been there a couple of time with friends visiting Hamburg. It's always been an incredible evening. Franco makes feel at home, but no only. The food is incredible. I cannot recommend enough this place."
4,"Love the concept: Choose either the predefined salads, or make your own combination.All the ingredients were so fresh, and it was a huge bowl of salad - I couldn't even finish it.Please note that theres a serious rush hour around lunch, place is probably best avoided at this time. Then again - we came during lunch and still found a place to sit. People dont sit too long, so tables free up all the time.Aaaand - theres free wifi. Bonus when you are tourist!"
4,"This museum was really amazing. It reminded me of the Natural History Museum in NYC, but without the barriers between you and the animals. You could get really close to the preserved animals and it made for a very interesting experience that really gave you a better sense of what the animals are like (you don't realize how big a grizzly is until you stand up next to it)."
3,Trendy & HotYoung & creative crowdDelicious & cheapGut & Günstig Perfect for friends gathering and burger sharing. Healthy salads for ladies are adding a good asset of choice
4,"Amazing! this place has 5 stars on Yelp and deserves it. This place really goes back to the basics, you eat in a tent and the menu is on a chalk board. Very traditional German is served here. I had a Wiener Schnitzel with fried potatoes. When he brough my plate out I could not believe how huge the schnitzel was and how many potatoes I got.The guy did not really speak English but was very helpful non the less he made sure I like it and even asked a passerby to help when I ordered to make sure he got my order right!At the end he told me desert was included! I got rice pudding that was simple but good. I don't even know how I had room left to eat it.All of that and a drink and my whole meal was less than 10 euros!Go for sure if you are in Hamburg!!"
1,Although their sign says Thai and Vietnamese food I didn't see much Vietnamese on the menu. I had the Penang Curry which was quite nice and a beer. The food was ok and plentiful but the table and the condiments on it were a bit greasy. I'm not really precious but it felt a bit grotty. I prefer my restaurants to be cleaner.
3,"Haifisch Bar is such an archetype of a Hamburg harbour bar that it almost hurts to see its raw realness. Loads of dusty, mysterious memorabilia all over the place. Reminding you of the good old days when the rough sailors were there on shore leave for strong drinks, picking fights and the girls. The furniture and bar are very old-fashioned - but not in that trendy retro way, it just IS original. A bar, some stools, a few tables and that's it.The lady behind this bar is profesionally friendly and nothing like the big-mouthed trollop you'd expect. Drinks are free of any glamour so you'd get your plain Astra or Jever. Prost!I have also been there for a 2 funky fiestas thrown by a business friend for their clients. So apparently there was food involved for the media people, too. And guess what? It was home-style cooking à la Hamburg: a buffet consisting of meatballs, bread rolls with fish, fish cake and potato salad. And everybody liked it.. as spoilt as they may be. Amazing!Maybe some thought this place was especially set up for them as a big spectacle?! So it's definitely worth checking out even though it can get pretty touristy (No photography allowed!). But if you wish to experience the real Hamburg, please do go."
4,"Excellent rib eye steak!!! One of the best steaks I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. Being from Texas, and having grown up on a ranch, eating steaks my whole life, you will not be disappointed here. The service is a little slow, order more beer to take up the extra time!! The cheesecake is excellent, not as good as Don't Tell Mama's, here in Hamburg, but well worth eating. Busy restaurant, never had trouble getting a table. A little better than Estancia Steak House because of price , and the cheesecake."
4,"Decided to come here for Sunday brunch while visiting Hamburg based on other reviews. It didn't disappoint! The breakfast offerings are outside of your traditional German (of course) but are superior in my opinion. Large portions, plenty of flavor, lots of choices. We were able to get seating immediately (lucky) around 1100. The service was relatively quick and the staff was very friendly. Prices were extremely reasonable and the two of us ate for under 20€. There was a mix of clientele; this restaurant is not just for Turkish or Arabic people. I recommend picking up a variety of the baklava and other sweets on your way out as well. I will be back if I'm ever in the area again!"
3,"Friendly staff, knowing what they're talking about.Could be a bit more into having a conversations its you, but hey, we're in Hamburg after all, not California or Portland, Oregon.Speaking off:I wish there would be some more exotic brews but then again this is an English (Irish?) pub, so:all goodGood brews, friendly staff - you won't be annoyed getting wasted here."
3,"Beautiful ""park"" in the middle of a hectic part of the city. Easy to reach from the Alsterkrug Hotel, where we stayed. Not much traffic we met 5 people on a sunny August Monday afternoon, but be aware of the sometimes speeding cyclists ;-) !! You can walk around the lake and the ""Moor"" easily in an hour, or spent much more if you follow each and every trail. Especially if you observe the cute little houses, with their accurate design and trimmed lawn (this is Germany ;-)  and of course some garden gnomes of the ""Kleingartenverein"" parcels around the Moor."
4,"Always wanted to meet Audrey Tautou? Me too, that's why I spend all of my free time loitering around this particular photo booth. It's of the type that uses intensely bright flash, bubbling chemicals, and only prints in black and white - yielding a hilarious result which means you'll be laughing by the third shot, and therefore get something you like! Compare this to the lifeless, soulless, trashy photo-me monopoly in the UK, with an annoying computer woman patronising you into looking stupid, and you'll be glad you came to Germany. I never did meet Amelie, but I will."
4,"I have had turkish food all over turkey and this place is just as good. A long line to order lunch but once I got through that, i ended up getting the chicken donner plate and it was legit. The rice had the needed texture/softness and the chicken was moist but not soggy. Outside of the kebabs I ate staring at the Galata bridge in Istanbul, this place is it. I guess come around 1PM if you want to avoid the lunch rush."
3,"I go here quite a lot as its just down the road, does very nice food but most importantly we get a great welcome.There are probably hundreds of Italian restaurants in Hamburg, but this is the place where we take Qype staffers visiting the city for the first time.It usually has a table, and the prices are pretty keen as well."
3,Mi Xao Gion was wig! Amazing. Def reco. She Pho Chay was shook. Also loved the spring rolls and the spicy glass noodle salad. Authentic decor too and friendly staff. Check it out. Also seems like most staff speaks English.
4,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here during our stay in Hamburg and I can safely say it was the best meal of my life. Armando was incredibly friendly and accommodating (since I'm a vegetarian.) Each of the four courses was better than the last, and the wine pairing was excellent. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys food. Wonderful, wonderful experience!"
4,"A great value Syrian (I think!) lunch venue in Aldstadt. Don't expect to get served within 20 minutes and get back to work, but if you want a decent sit down session come Friday, you can't go far wrong."
1,"Haven't been able to taste the burger yet because we have been made waiting for 1h 20 minutes as for now. Basically the service ignored us, taking orders from anybody else around us which came AFTER us. Eventually we had to ask for menus. After 1h10m, when we decided to talk to the manager, he only put up a bunch of excuses. I can now count 6 tables that sat after us, ordered, ate, paid and left before we could even see our burgers...Oh and the drinks are room temperature warm.EDIT:Food eventually came and I have to admit it was really good, make sure you try the different homemade sauces and the fries."
0,"Busy place - which does not honor table reservations. We arrived with a party of 20 - and had, of course, a reservation. We were told to wait outside, in a long queue. We left."
2,"It's expensive for the quality they are offering but I guess you have to pay also for the location. The wine was nice but the food quite tasteless. We just ordered a mozzarella salat for the two of us and well, it was cute and ok but not at al for two persons. It is a fine restaurant if you want mostly enjoy the location."
0,"Burgers are ok. Cheesecake is good.Gave it a second chance to make up for the 1st time... But...Service is still HORRIBLE. 30 minutes in between even seeing a server. Bartenders running food. No method to the madness. This place is understaffed, over sat and mismanaged. 2.5 full hours from seating till payment of check for a BURGER. that's insanity.I won't be back to endure another waste of an evening"
4,"Some of best fish ever, and excellent service. Had a great food experience. Will come here again :)"
4,"cute little bistrot in eppendorf!very friendly staff and delicious food! It's best for a sunny saturday or an early dinner and/or a glass of wine after work, since Engelke closes at 8pm. We were 3 there, and each of us had a different meal. They all tasted amazingly good and are very fresh.Actually they have a constant menu, a week menu and a daily menu, so you can't get bored from the food there. I dont have any complaints!"
4,"Had a great 3 course lunch menu here for EUR6.90: salad buffet, soup and a choice of main courses. Impressed."
3,"I believe this was the first burger joint we dined at in Hamburg and it is still one of my favorites. Yes, the burgers are hard to eat because the patty is shaped pretty much like a baseball and everything is contained between two small english muffins. But everything I've ordered here has been delicious and satisfying. The fries have that homemade quality and you get a lot of it. If you still have room after the giant plate of burger and fries, you have to have the cheese cake, self-proclaimed as the best cheese cake in the world. I believe it! The staff is nice and friendly. Always a good time and delicious food to be had here."
4,"This is the COOLEST museum/exhibit that I have EVER SEEN!  When you think you are going to visit a tiny recreation of the world via trains...it is even better and bigger than that.  I mean, this guy and his team have thought of everything!!!  The lights go down for nighttime and the sceneries interact with you/change depending on the time of day, etc.  It is so hard to explain the magic of this place.  There are generally lines but so worth the wait.  Block off some time for this one.  This is not a place you want to pop in a run through.  The details are crazy cool and necessitate a lengthier visit.  I wish I could go back and share this with so many of my friends and family members but it is sooo far away for me.  If you are reading this and considering a visit, do it!  You will not be disappointed, but rather left in awe by the creativeness of it all."
4,"And so I did check it out! Pauli Pizza is definitely my new fave take-out pizza place! The menu is only DIY, and I was very overwhelmed by the choice. Fortunately the creative pizza genius of Lea was on hand to produce a pizza to savour. Two eggs? Yes please! Highly recommended for pizza, beer and chat."
2,"Unique decor.Meat and fish menu are really nice, but the sushi and hot drinks needs more improvement."
0,"If you live near the Schanze and are on a budget, you'll know La Sepia. Likely you've eaten there more than once; I certainly have. I've had acceptable dining experiences there (meaning nothing appalling), but mostly, the quality is mediocre or just a cut below. The service, as mentioned elsewhere, is slow, not attentive, and sometimes just plain rude. To sum up: if it's about the money, you might do all right. But if you can afford it--or if quality is important to you--go somewhere else."
4,this place is awesome for kids and adults.  Its amazing how much detail went into creating all the miniature trains and figures.  The new airport model is in a class in its own and I watched it for half an hour before my girl friend pulled me away.  This is a must see attraction in Hamburg*this place often gets full quick but you can make a time reservation so you don't have to stand in line.  The later evening times have less people and are more enjoyable.
2,"1. homeless could come in to beg for food while you are eating ( so environment is bad) 2. food quality --- bad ( I'm Asian, so maybe I'm too strict on the taste.) 3. cheap --- so I still go there from time to time. When it get better, I will reverse my review :)"
4,"We fully enjoyed delicious, creamy pistachio ice cream in home made waffle. A ball of ice cream was surprisingly large, which makes this place very affordable. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. Last, but not least, a special feature for kids - there is a swing outside!"
1,"If you speak English or not that much German and have any needs that you want to communicate, this might not be the place. The staff did not understand what we asked for when saying ""keine Milch"", which should be pretty self explanatory.. They also forgot to give us our drinks. Food (when we finally managed to make an order) was good, though."
3,"No, not like Duff Beer, it's Dulf's Burger! This joint serves up some amazing meat between buns utilizing a high tech ordering system that you will have to experience yourself. It'll be one of those times where you just wish every restaurant had this system that just makes things easier.I went big with my burger and ordered a special that had everything. I'm talking fried egg, avocado, etc. While it was damn delicious (see the cross section photo I posted), I sort of wish I just went with a straight up cheeseburger to bask in the glory of simple hamburger in Hamburg. The onion rings were good, but I think I would rather have went with the fries.I do think Burgerlich is better than Dulf's, but both are real good in their own ways. Check out both of them while you're in town!"
4,A very friendly and welcoming place with a good menu that can always be adapted. Neo and the team will always look after you.
3,"I'm shoooory? That's what the waitress kept saying when my friend and I asked her questions about the items on the menu. She's super cute and my friend was totally hitting on her. We were in search of some pho to kick start our day after a night of drinking. It's the perfect cure for a hangover (see previous reviews of my Eurotrip). After a short amount of deliberations, Yelp brought us to Quán dò. The restaurant is conveniently located around the corner from the HBF and easy to find. We didn't spend much time studying the menu because it was in German. However, there was Vietnamese writing (no English?) next to the German item. It's not hard to find ""Bò tái - Rindfleisch ,medium'"" on the menu, especially seeing it on hundreds of other menus. I also ordered the Lychee lemonade to wash it down. Water is not free in Germany. You'll have to fork over some euros for stillwater. I was absolutely amazed to see water in glass bottles. They're pretty rare in America.The Bò tái was served Northern style for sure. The broth was very savory and the soup came with a Chinese fried dough. That's how they do it in Vietnam and it was great eating something authentic in a foreign place. If you are used to a plate of bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil, you are in the wrong place. That's Southern style.  Hamburg is certainly diverse enough to have a large population of Asians. Still we were missing some critical items to make our broth perfect. We asked for some red chilies because it lacked the spice we needed. The waitress gave us a bowl of chopped red chilies. The lychee lemonade was very refreshing.The price was under €10 and very affordable. I would definitely come back again."
3,"Really good pizza. Too big to finish! Free Sambucha shots with the receipt, nice touch. Free bubbly while you wait for a table too. Watch out though, they pour you San Pelegrino water without asking, of you drink it, €5 added to your cheque. A very nice experience overall and a tasty lunch the next day ;)"
4,Walking in the door the delicious smell of brewing beer. Chicken spinach curry was today's special for 7 Euros. Messing beer also delicious and reasonable.
3,"We went to Witwenball for a special occasion dinner when some friends visited from out of town. Overall, the space is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is good. I think my only real complaint is that the pacing of the meal was extremely slow (for my taste)."
4,"What a lovely restaurant. The server/owner was delightful, warm, charming, witty, and welcoming. Phenomenal service. Fantastic chef/owner. Food was outstanding. Perfectly executed. Delicious. Would return in a heartbeat and with great pleasure. Highly recommended!"
4,"My husband and I were craving a US diner style breakfast and found Mamalicious on Yelp. It by far surpassed our expectations and absolutely hit the spot for breakfast.We ordered the original eggs benedict, a side or chocolate chip pancakes and bottomless coffee. Everything was soooooo good.  Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian but the meat substitutes that came on our eggs benedict was delicious even by my bacon-loving husband's standards. The service was very friendly, the price was right, the filter coffee was great and the venue was very cute and cozy. It was very busy on a Saturday morning and we were there right after they opened. So we will keep that in mind the next time we come back. All in all, I think this will become a favorite of ours in Hamburg. So excited to have found this place!"
4,"Cozy interior, outdoor seating, very nice staff and relaxed atmosphere. And most importantly - delicious food!! We've tried 4 different dishes so far and they were all really high quality and very well made!"
3,"great food for a reasonable price, also pretty handy as it is situated next to the university."
3,"Copperhouse isn't bad, actually it's quite good. I really loved their lamb and halibut. This is an Asian food buffet/ teppanyaki style restaurant. It's 25 euros for all you can eat, so it's more of a come while you're starving kind of place. Most of the dishes are pretty mediocre, but the lamb and fish were delicious. Hence four stars instead of three. Some of the dishes included stir fry fried noodles, fried duck, egg rolls, fresh fruit, and fried bananas. I also had a strawberry colada which was pretty decent as well. There are some things that need improvement such as their not so good sauces and cold chocolate cake (honestly a chocolate mousse from the local supermarket would be much better than this).  Also, the sushi could use some love. I'm not sure if I would come back on my own, but if someone else suggested it I would probably come along. Oh, it's also located right on the Reeperbahn, so it's a good place to get loaded up on food before your drinking night out."
3,"Tasteful menu, craft beers, and bowling alley in the basementIf you like a modern international fare that focuses on German/European food I highly recommend the Freischwimmer.The restaurant comes with a sleek and dark design inside and a cozy beer garden outside. Plus, there is a fun two-lane bowling alley (ninepins) in the basement that you can rent before or after dinner!During my last visit with friends we had the 'calamaretti' (filled calamari), the EURO2016 Burger with cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola, the steak fritte and the Roast beef.Everything tasted great, and I would order it again, especially the calamaretti! However, the burger's toppings (cranberries, artichoke, brie and rucola) could have been more.Besides a great menu, the drinks are great, as is the beer on tap and their craft beer selection as well.A nice finish for a fun evening with friends is the bowling alley! We had so much fun that we will be back for sure!+ tasteful diversified menu (changes monthly!)+ good drinks, wine and beer menu+ prompt service and fun hosts+ not very noisy for a restaurant+ cozy beer garden+ fun bowling alley in the basement+ metro train right next door Average entrée: EUR 18Credit cards accepted.Mon-Sun from 5pm"
4,"YES. YES. YES. This is the best wurst in Hamburg without a doubt. My mother grew up in Hamburg and agrees wholeheartedly, so you know it's good. I worked in the area, which was both a blessing and a curse. You'd think after the 20th time visiting that I would get nauseous at the sight of another Thüringer, Bockwurst or Bratwurst, but the closer I got, the faster my heart would beat, the louder my tummy would rumble, and the more my mouth would water. I was addicted. The currywurst is supposedly their specialty, but I don't like my wurst swimming in sauces. Still worth a try if that's what you're into! Otherwise I'd recommend the Thüringer or Bratwurst with fries!"
0,"The food is fine, but the service is so so so bad. I literally waited 90 minutes between ordering and getting my food. I've had two perfectly nice evenings ruined by coming here. Then again, it's always ram packed, so they're obviously doing something right."
2,"This place was mobbed when we ventured in on a cold Tuesday night in March. We had been looking for somewhere to a have quick drink with a decent atmosphere and it fitted the bill. Named after a gangster from America during the 1920's the place had photos of him everywhere. It was was also dark and moody looking, set up to be like a cocktail bar that a mobster might frequent.In terms of a place to have a drink this could well have been a 4 star as it was busy, had some atmosphere, attentive service and a good array of drink options. For two main reasons for me it is only a three star. Firstly they allow smoking inside. For me it is now a very much out dated practise that no way should be allowed inside bars. Secondly the drinks were a bit on the pricey side working out at 27 euros for three. So works out about £7 a drink, which is pricey compared to other places in the city. If these two things don't bother you I reckon you will love it here. Decent cocktail bar, certainly busy on a Tuesday night."
0,"Had duck with vegetables and rice with peanut-curry sauce. The meat, if it was meat, tasted absolutely artificial and the sauce neither tasted like peanut sauce nor had a kind of curry taste. Somewhat unidentically! The meat was extremely tender and underneath the panade was dough or something. The ""meat"" to my mind was some kind of fake which had no meat content at all. Overall it was a really unpleasant experience. Never again!!"
3,"Burgerlich had me licking my fingers. Good thing I came in with clean hands.The burgers here are very juicy and flavorful. And with the accoutrement of the housemade sauce, sundried tomato relish, melting cheese, and a pretty generous helping of mayo, you can expect it to get a little bit messy. Being that the burgers come on a tasty and light brioche bun, by default, you know that a brioche bun can't soak up the entirety of this meaty-juicy mess, so it's gonna get on you. The bathroom is upstairs when you're ready to clean up.The ordering system is pretty fun and novel. They've installed pop-up screens at every seat within the restaurant. Choose your burger and customize via a touchscreen. I didn't get too fancy with my cheeseburger, I just added some bacon on it. Side note: the onion rings here are awesome and I don't normally order or care for onion rings. Another really good hamburger in Hamburg that I've experienced as a new Hamburger."
4,"My favorite falafel place ever!!! I used to live in Hamburg and bike here often. My favorite was the falafel Teller box. So many delicious things on one plate. They make them in house and hot and fresh in front of you. I also like their mint tea. And they were always friendly even though I didn't speak German well. I live back in San Francisco now, but my boyfriend and his band are in Hamburg today to play a concert and I told him to go here! He has heard me talk about it a bunch!Totally worth the visit and it's in a great neighborhood w tons of rad shops near by."
4,"This is actually the first place I've been in Hamburg when I first came here, so it's kind of special for me cause it brings up a lot of good memories, sensations and people. It's a great place to go if the weather is good and chill a bit drinking a beer or watching a football game, i.e. during the World Cup or the Europeans."
4,"This place is amazing! Such great food! Decent price and great service, what more could you ask for?I came in on a slow night and the waiter gave me a free shot on the house. Not to mention the food was out of this world!"
3,"If you come to Hamburg on Sunday morning you will visit the Fischmarkt. You have to be there very early and after a walk and bargaining with different Fischmarkt-sellers, you will need a place to chill. If you follow the way from Fischmarkt to St. Pauli-Landungsbrücken, you pass Strand Pauli (that means Beach Pauli. And if it is summer and if the sun shines, you can sit on sofas or beachchairs or even lie on a queensize bed, drink Cocktails or have a breakfast, or snacks like Hamburger. The prices are a little bit higher than in a Pub - but when you see, that you have a beach in the harbour and can watch the ships passing by (as we saw the Sadov today) it is worth the money. We paid 10 Euros for 3 very well served non alcoholic drinks."
3,Nice restaurant in a distinguished area of Hamburg center. Persian cuisine is well-known for its savoury dishes. Its worth the visit to enjoy the main course and their appetisers.
4,"Unbelievable, this place has a name! Thanks Kittles! The Sofabar was one of the first bars I visited when I came to Germany, and remains one of my favorite evening locales (during that dead hour after the evening is over but night hasn't begun yet). While the place is mostly packed, the Sofabar is always cozy, comfortable and inviting. Furnished with 20-odd sofas, the Sofabar is great for couples, but especiallyfor groups of 5 or more - this makes the Sofabar a great spot for birthdays! The Sofabar is one of Hamburg's most unique locales and a must-visit for those wanting to try out something different than the traditional bartop."
4,"I was in a rush and wanted to grab a quick takeaway for the train. The staff here was professional and helpful (in both English and German), and my Pho was done in 5 minutes! Everything nicely packed, very tasty, and proportion was perfect for the containers. Can't wait to eat in next time!"
2,This place has a nice laid back atmosphere and solid drinks. The food is good and the staff was nice. A nice place to spend the summer-evening with friends.
1,"I'm mean really guys- 4 beers two burgers and some Nachos = €75 or something - really...?Burger were OK - Buns were a disgrace , Nachos - Good!- Staff had to be reminded three times of the empty beer glasses and a new order  !-but they were friendly!I'm travelling world wide - always end up in some hard rock cafe, since all the folks find it sooo cool - LAME!Hey, they played German Electro beats at the Hardrock cafe Hamburg - That has NOTHING to do with Hard Rock - play Rock - or actually Hard Rock, hence the name-Only tourists - not one person from HH in there.Just a big corporation trying to sell some shirts for € 20-40 a pop- Nothing to see here , move on!"
4,"Sometimes the popularity of this place annoys me, but that's only ever on Friday and Saturday evenings. At all other times it's really cool to have a bar that's always bustling. It's a pretty simple concept. Great lighting, comfortable seats, good drinks, handy location."
2,"5EUR entry costcheesy music... the kind of music you'd only expect to hear in german clubsi mean 80s and 90s music mixed with last year's songs and a bit of bob marley then some ABBA.The DJ thinks that by mixing, he's supposed to mix styles and songs...ok you get my point: Music - BADbut at least its full, its funnythere are a lot of people, which means a lot of weird people too. I am not sure id be back... not really my type of club but if u were rejected entry in the other hip clubs, try it out... you'll have a laugh"
4,"I've already reviewed the London MASH restaurant so what more can I add here?Well, at the time of writing, this place was only a few weeks old in Hamburg. From my experience, these guys have really hit the ground running.The restaurant located in the smart and swanky harbour area of the city. From the outside and in, it looks and feels distinctly MASH. The glass front gives you views of the harbour but also opens up the restaurant and makes it feel quite spacious. The MASH bods have effectively split the space into two areas either side of the main doors and the cloakroom. The opulent bar is in keeping with the London offering - sleek, modern and stocked with a great range of spirits (especially whiskeys) and cocktails. The restaurant is is spacious and opens out into a second dining area at the back of the restaurant. So how does MASH Hamburg fare versus MASH London? I'd have to say, on this occasion I thought it was potentially better!! The service was faultless. As soon as they realised I was English, out popped the English menu and full service in English. The menu is identical but is actually even better value given that you pay the same in Euros as you do in Sterling. The wine list is also a hugely impressive tome which has to be one of the most comprehensive in Germany. The food was sublime. I ordered my regular; 600g bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed spinach and chips. Having only dined a week previously in London I had a decent barometer but this was even better. That is some compliment. As always, I didn't have space for a dessert. I'll be back in Hamburg and when I am, I will definitely be returning."
3,"We went there for the coffee and were pleasantly surprised by the food.  The toasted bagel the hubs ordered with lox & all the trimmings was so very tasty.  A little dab of sweet mustard was the secret ingredient.  -feeling a bit under the weather I ordered a small (4dl?) carrot juice with ginger.  It was just how I would have made it for myself.  The ginger boost was such that I felt I'd never catch a cold again!  Both the bagel and juice were served by a smiling young woman who works in the kitchen.The light roasted beans a la a roastery in Sweden (naturally!) make for a slightly-sour-never-bitter cup and I, for one, am quite glad about that.  The flat white is made with a lactose-rich milk that produces a lovely sweet flavour when heated correctly.  The espresso macchiato (aka noisette in Parisian third wave joints) is made with a 'usual milk' and the drink is tinged with a sour note.We then ordered an Aeropress and were presented with *thee* most choice one could ever hope for!  I think the selection was upwards of twelve different roasts!  Qual der Wahl, baby.  Some of the roasts were meant to ape various black tea varieties.  Eric chose an African bean, Kamigeri, and was quite pleased with both the aroma and flavour.  -a hint of black tea, orange and currant.The young man behind the counter was very enthusiastic, friendly and didn't assume that one didn't know a fig about coffee.  -could be due in part to his having only been on the job for approximately two weeks on our visit.  This made for a friendly exchange when ordering.Winterhude, the area in which SEC is located, is also in and of itself worth a visit.  For those out-of-towners keen to visit H.H., I would strongly encourage not only a trip out of the usual destinations like Reeperbahn & the Harbor, but a trip specifically up to Winterhude with a stop or more in Eimsbüttel as well."
4,"Der beste Grieche in ganz Hamburg.Wer hier nicht bei Top-Essen satt wird,ist selber Schuld!"
4,"to echo another reviewer: hands down the best falafel in hamburg.it's also, miraculously, the cheapest: €2,50 for a basic wrap, €,50 for each additional ingredient, meaning you can get an enormous, overstuffed, insanely delicious falafel for the same price as a shitty, flavorless one at every other shop. i know which one i'd choose!"
4,"thank you, international Yelpers... this place is so 5-star i desperately wish it was in my 'hood back in L.A. CA USA.  it's everything one would want in a neighbourhood spot:  -so friendly...the first time we were there, one of the workers asked if we were new to the area, and when he found out we were just tourists from America, he really went out of his way to answer all our questions about Hamburg. -so cozy. there are two rooms, both with comfy couches, and tables and chairs.  there's a big covered patio out front, with a dog bowl for thirsty pups.  there's even a basket of books for kids! -so delicious.  they've got great chai lattes and good coffee.  the pastries are fresh and there's a good selection of German classics.  they make a nice quiche plate that comes with salad too.  everything's plated really nicely.we came here as much a possible during our stay and really loved our relaxed afternoons there, people-watching while sipping a delicious drink with yummy eats. it's really the perfect incarnation of a local cafe/coffee spot."
4,"The best cup of coffee I had in Germany, and possibly ever, came from this lovely little cramped coffee house we spotted on our way back to the train after a full day of exploring Hamburg. We were desperate to acclimate to the time change and coffee sounded like just the ticket, so we stopped in and ordered a highly caffeinated round of deliciousness. I ordered a flat white and a chocolate torte (I actually received a pomegranate cheesecake type treat, which is likely 20% due to the staggeringly loud atmosphere and 80% due to me not speaking a single word of German!), but I still enjoyed it. The coffee was the crowning glory of our stop - rich, strong, perfectly poured and capped with a layer of foam decorated with a pretty little heart. I wanted to try to get back here before heading back to the states, but it was just far enough away from where we were staying that I couldn't swing it. I will dream about that delightful flat white, however, and if I ever return, this will be at the top of my list."
1,"Had dinner here with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. Tasted good, but messed up our plumbing. Won't be coming here anymore! Unless you're ok with a tummy ache after. Good luck!"
4,"A great new Irish pub in Deichstrasse. A great selection of beer and whiskey as the name would suggest. Live music, karaoke and live sports on tv add to the atmosphere. Definitely a great place to meet up and only a short walk from Rodingsmarkt U-Bahn station. Richard and the team give you a warm welcome and I look forward to going back many times."
4,"So I have had some good Italian meals and last night we came here as a work group and some visitors from out of town. This experience was pretty special.We all went for the taster menu and the whole thing was just fantastic.15 year old super viscous Balsamic vinegar, extra first pressed Sicilian olive oil, angel hair spaghetti with truffles, carpaccio of smoked tunafish, melt in the mouth Tiramisu great wine, and really good service.A really good place to enjoy incredible Sicilian Italian food outside on a warm evening. Not the cheapest, but one of the best."
2,"I went to this coffee shop yesterday super excited after I saw their amazing tools( grinder, aero press, roasting their own beans etc.). I assumed it would be an amazing coffee shop and even brought my sister and boyfriend to show them the great location I found while visiting Hamburg. When we went to order our coffees I learned that they don't carry any non dairy milk which disappointed me a lot. Seeing vegan food options on the menu made me believe they for sure would carry non dairy milk but I was wrong. I passed on my coffee order after making the barrister aware I can't have milk and was offered a chai latte or tea. Button line is...carrying vegan food options but no non dairy milk was pretty disappointing to me."
3,"Ach, das gute alte Meyer Lansky's- immer eine sichere Sache. Ich muss sagen, dass ich den Service hier immer durch die Bank weg erstaunlich gut finde. Die bieten dir schon einen neuen Drink an, wenn der alte noch nicht ganz aufgetrunken ist...naja, ist vielleicht manchmal gar nicht schlecht, wenn es mal ne kurze Pause zwischendurch gibt ;) Hilfsbereit, wenn man an einen anderen Tisch umziehen will und den Cocktail bekommt man noch zu Happy Hour Preisen, wenn man ihn vor dem Ende der Zeit schon mal reserviert hat. 1 A. Toiletten sind auch zu später Stunde noch völlig ok. Was ich allerdings richtig schrecklich finde, ist, dass man in dem Laden rauchen darf. Schade!"
3,This is a very nice family owned Italian restaurant. I came here for dinner and enjoyed the cosy atmosphere. Better yet it was neither too pack nor was it too loud. The food was alright. Not the best Italian I have had in Hamburg but definitely fair in regards to value for money. The mains are ~8 euros. What I can vouch very much for though is their tiramisu. That was very good and very large! Order one and split between 2 as I did.The most surprising thing for me was this was the first time in my entire year in Hamburg thus far  that a waiter has asked me if I'd like tap water when i asked for water. This is such a rarity in Germany. Anyone that's moved to Germany will know what i mean. That in itself is deserving of an additional star hence 4
0,"I have been to another Chinese Loving Hut in London, and this one was very disappointing. We went for lunch time, got the lunch deal (spring rolls or soup + a plate on the reduced menu for 6.90€). The tables weren't clean and we had to wait for 25 minutes before anyone came to get our order, but so far so good, I can live with that for the sake of good food for such a price! Sadly, our entries arrived (one soup and spring rolls) and they were barely warm. Our main course also looked re-heated. It wasn't hot, the texture of my sauce was as if the gelatine used to thicken had been cooled down and then re-heated, which caused it to be way too thick and glumpy - not good. The menu advertised that I would get seitan, though it really looked like a can mock-duck to me. The fried rice was tasty still, they can have that. We got our drinks halfway through the main course. Overall, it seems that depending on what you order, it's a hit or miss."
4,"Trüffelschwein is a restaurant that is well deserving of its Michelin star (I personally would give it two), and we have now been feeling extra lucky to know how close we live to it and how amazing food-art is just a stone's ""throw away,"" as long as their is plenty of ""disposable"" income lying around. ;o)In all seriousness, a meal here is without question worth the price tag and was certainly one of the best fine dining meals we've had. It is also definitely a place worthy of milestone celebrations so it was the perfect spot to celebrate my wife's birthday. There were a number of options for the amount of courses to partake in, five to be exact, and we opted for the 7 course degustation which really came out to 11 courses after the amazing amuse bouche and dessert extras.1st beef tartare-cucumber-gin: tasty and very well balanced, also came with two pieces of steak to grill on a tiny personal grill.2nd prawn-pork belly-couscous-saffron: excellently prepared prawn over fork-tender pork belly and savory fine couscous, it was one of my favorites.3rd stuffed cabbage-truffle-truffle jus: this dish was completely covered in decadent truffle shavings. 4th pineapple vanilla sorbet-champagne: excellent palate cleanser before the main.  5th iberico pork-truffle-celery-almonds: our main course had so many different delicious elements to it, my wife called it ""a journey on a plate""...apt.6th aperol spritz to eat: amazing frozen aperol with a lot of sweet and delectable surprises in it like fruit and candied things.7th frozen goat cheese-tarragon-white chocolate-olive oil: sensational dessert that was almost too pretty to eat and despite many of the savory elements, it was still quite sweet and was easily one of my most favorite desserts ever. 8th birthday cake!One thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the fact that we weren't really sure how everything was going to taste ahead of time. There were a lot of new flavor combinations and surprises for our palates which I really enjoyed.Overall, the food was excellent and beautifully and artfully plated. Service was fantastic. We both really enjoyed our entire dining experience and hopefully won't be waiting as long as we did to dine here again."
1,"Food is pretty mediocre and the service is completely indifferent at best and downright rude and negligent at worst.  I go here very often as it is close to my workplace and there are relatively few choices in the area, especially after 9pm."
2,"The Neustädter Grill Meier is a no frills German fast food joint in the Wexstrasse, frequently visited by office workers in the area. It has all the usual menu items you will find at any other German Imbiss like Bratwurst (grilled sausage), Currywurst (sausage in a sweet, curry-spiced ketchupy sauce), Schnitzel, fries, Halbes Hähnchen (1/2 roasted chicken), potato salad but also other meals such as goulash with mashed potatoes. I mostly opt for the large Currywurst with Fries. Even though the sausage is not grilled (since this place doesn't have grill, everything is deep fried) it's good and the sauce (not self-made) also does it's work. Fries come in a well-sized portion and are hot and crisp. Those of you who want a no frills German Imbiss with acceptable prices should spend their lunch here. Unfortunately this place is closed on weekends, so I have to find another joint to satisfy my rare Imbiss cravings"
3,"We just stopped in for a coffee and snack after a long walk, but was happy with the service and atmosphere. Would like to go back sometime for a more proper meal."
1,"The food was just about OK but what I was really annoyed is that there was a large group of people sitting next to our table making so much noise, laughing and chatting loudly. Later I realised that they were either friends or family of the owners. My point is that if the owner wanted a family get together, they should have closed the restaurant for others!"
3,"Wow, the best American-style breakfast I've seen in town so far! Fluffy pancakes with yummy Canadian maple syrup, and kaffee satt  free coffee refills! Cute deco, kinda small (could imagine it might be hard to get a table sometimes, but there seems to be room to squeeze 1-2 people in somewhere), and sometimes from time to time kinda loud music. Nice window bar-type seating as well, and the cheesecakes looked scrumptious! Friendly waitstaff. Reasonable prices (2 big brunches and coffees for 2 for 21.40EUR). Will go again for brunch or coffee and cake!"
1,The bar is situated in the heart of eimsbüttel. The interior is nice and cosy with lovely vintage sofas. Unfortunately we were disappointed by the cocktails. We had a Gin Fizz which quite frankly had no fizz and a Mojito which was nothing more than ok. I do hope that the coffees served are nicer as it's a lovely little place.
1,Bad service even for Germany. Not the best food either. If you want beer and to be ignored go here. If you are actually hungry.... good luck. The sampler platter is not very appealing. Just skip to the entrees and save your self the money.
2,"The atmosphere here is certainly very pleasant. Staff is friendly, the restaurant is very nicely decorated, noise level is unobtrusive, etc.The food is, well, overpriced, just like others have already stated - think roughly 15 Euros for a vegetarian meal and about 18 for a meat dish.The focus here is on appearance and on sauce. Thus, you will receive a dish that looks visually stunning - but there won't be much to it. In essence, you will receive whatever your chosen main ingredient is, doused in a sauce.It's fine, but it's completely overpriced for what you get. You can apply this rule to just about any dish we ordered. Tofu and Chili? It's really just fried tofu and and a few slices of chili pepper in a spicy sauce. Would it have hurt them to add a few veggies? Of course, you might say that the food is exactly what the description says - and that is certainly true. However, I do NOT find this to be true at any of the rather many Thai restaurants I've eaten at around the globe. Maybe it's a German thing?The red curry followed the same principle - there was, however, a tiny bit of variation in it. We counted four peas. Three halves of mushrooms. Some carrot slices. And lots of cabbage. That seemed a bit lame. Alas, you know what took the cake: Mini Corn out of jar!!! I have no idea who in their right mind still uses mini corn in any dish, let alone a Thai dish - all I know is that's it's a big N O.Overall, our experience was nice - but this restaurant is not really up to snuff. I think Germany is still desperately trying to incorporate it's ""multi-kulti"" aspirations in the culinary scene - and things are improving. For now, the German palate still has not reached a comprehensive understanding of the wide array of food that is available. Sure, each cuisine is tailored to local tastes anywhere in the world - and that ""customization"" can be offensive if you expect ""authentic."" It's akin to eating Chinese food in Latin America. Or  ""Mexican"" in Germany (I've tried - I don't think that really exists).So, if you want Thai, then this is certainly acceptable. Don't expect to get any real Thai food - expect a bare minimum that caters to the German palate. It's close enough for now.I don't think I would go back. There are, quite apparently, better venues to be tried."
4,"Cracking little Mexican cafe/bar serving real mexican food, the likes of which, I had never tasted! It's a lot like mud, basically, but made from chocolate, and call Mole. Maybe it's made from moles? Of course, the real attraction here is the extensive range of tequila, some of which didn't even make us projectile vomit across the table! Actually I suspect there may have been a little chundering but hell, it's all good."
2,"This place is odd to visit as an Englishman. It reminds you that there are many brands of 'Germany' in GermanyIt's a great big bavarian themed beer hall  complete with beer wenches, Steins and oompah bandA race to get get full to the gills with masses or beer, German food then loudly sing well known German songs.When I was there, I joined two of the waiting staff as we watched a little mouse scuttle between two tables and the bar to run behind one of the service tables. They looked at each other and went about their business. So not a place to impress anyone, but as the Hofbrauhaus in Hamburg it does what it says on the tin. I'd come again to watch Football or for a stag do, but that's about it."
3,We had a dinner with 15 colleagues there and they seated us in the nice kind of outside area with a roof. It was a little bit tight for 15 people but it was okay.It took a long time until we got our food but that was probably because the restaurant was packed and we were a lot of people.I got the Pizza Vegetarina with extra Artichokes for around 10 Euro and an alcohol free beer. It was very delicious and it just costed 14 Euro in sum.You get a good but not the best pizza.
1,I had a family brunch here on Sunday.Good thing is that they have lego and toys for children to play near the entrance.
3,"Nice cozy restaurant featuring Franconian cuisine and drinks.Pros: Friendly, multi-lingual staff with English menusPet friendlyCons: Pet friendly"
4,"First time having Curry Worst, my brother has had it many times and we both thought it was fantastic."
4,Really cosy place where you can enjoy a good coffee or hot chocolate in a very friendly atmosphere. :)
3,"Keep coming back for the fried noodles and of course Vietnamese Ice Coffee! The restaurant can be very packed during lunch time or dinner time. I don't know if what they serve is authentic, but I'm pretty sure it's tasty!"
2,"I was recommended Gazi Antep by friends, but I can't say that I was impressed. Far from it in fact, it seemed like a pretty standard kebab shop with nothing to make it stand out as particularly good. I can't totally remember what I had, but I think it was some kind of doner plate."
4,"Great spot for Polish food! My friend recommended this place as he said this is like his comfort food. I can see what he means as the food is very hearty and reminds you of home cooked meals immediately! A couple of friends and I met up for dinner and drinks on a Sunday night here. I hear that this place can be very crowded so it is best to call ahead and reserve if you can. We we got there though, there was plenty of room, but they did indicate which tables were reserved and at what times. For my drink, I ordered the Parliament mule which consisted of vodka, ginger, and I think bitter orange? It was very tasty and refreshing. Reminded me of a mimosa but with a vodka kick!For our appetizer, we shared a plate of pickled vegetables and we also nibbled on fresh bread and dip (on the house!). The pickled vegetables assortment was pretty interesting. There were not just cucumbers in the mix but also little squash veggies and tomatoes as well. It was a great start to the meal. My friend mentioned that you usually start with the pickled vegetables and shots of vodka. I think that sounds better so I might try that next time! :)For my entree, I ordered the mixed plate of pierogis. It comes with 8 pirerogis (mix of vegetable and meat ones) and some sour cream sauce for dipping. I was a little bit scared 8 pieces would not be enough but the pieces are packed with vegetable and meat fillings so yeah in the end... I was happy and full!It's a great spot for dinner and drinks as they have their own spin on cocktails and the classic choices for your beers. The food is all really great and reasonably priced! I need to come back to try the borsch! :)"
4,"This place is absolutely amazing and one of the coolest things I've seen in Hamburg. The detail work and the depth in all of the models is stunning. It's also brilliant how they've done the set up so that children see one thing, and adults see something more. In many ways it's two museums layered in and intermixed with each other all at the same time. The attention to detail and creativity that defines this museum makes it a very memorable experience. It is hands-down one of Hamburg's absolutely must not miss experiences no matter what your age or interests are."
4,"This place was great. I kinda had a mini overload. Fun for all ages young and old. The pieces they have are of historical, modern and imaginative. I'm  from Los Angeles California, and went to Hamburg for business. On a day I had off I came across this great gem of a tourist destination. I would like to come back and see new displays they come up with."
3,"Cooko is offering a Great vararity of Vietnamese and Asian dishes. Thus everyone should find something on the menu. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the dishes are freshly & fast prepared."
3,If you are ever in Hamburg. Don't miss this place! The schnitzel was excellent as well as the potato pancakes Nice atmospheric. Truly enjoyed. C
4,"Great asian food, and it's all vegan! Every lunch is only 6,90EUR and includes a soup or spring rolls as starter. (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  My vegetables with tofu and cashews were absolutely delicious! (flickr.com/photos/moe/49…)  Great food and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."
4,The most beautiful building of old classic architecture in Hamburg. The Rathaus building was once described to me that it is so impressive because it is reflecting the self confidence of the Hamburgers and their love for the city. It think that is a pretty good description. :)
4,"Dining at Vienna is really something of a special treat! The food is marvellous and fairly priced for the quality, the table service is friendly and abundant, and the dining room, while small, is cozy rather than cramped. There are only a handful of tables and a waiting area with a bar, so it is recommended to arrive at 1800 on the dot to avoid missing out on a table. (They don't take reservations). I ate a mouthwatering fish soup for starters, with homemade chips and a tangy remoulade on the side  great combination. Following that, and sticking to my theme of seafood, I practically demolished the Skrei fillet with pumpkin crust on a bed of spinach, leaving only two small potato fingers on my plate. While a peek at the dessert menu proved tempting, we opted out as a result of feeling perfectly satisfied after entrees and main courses. After all, the portion sizes were quite generous,(and delicious!) This trio would return to Vienna at the drop of a hat, as the rest the dishes on the menu remain to be sampled! A fabulous conclusion to an unforgettable weekend in Hamburg."
4,"My wife and I stopped here for dinner after work one night. I've only been in Hamburg for a month or so, but this is easily the best burger I've had in my time here. I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my wife got the Zillertaler Bacon Burger, and both were fantastic. Her's was a little heavy on the sauce, but that didn't really detract from the burger other than to make it messier. Prices were also totally reasonable.They've got great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. They even project whatever is on TV outside as well, so we were able to keep half an eye on the F1 qualifier."
0,"Very poor service: disorganized and unfriendly staff that can't handle any pressure. We ordered two drinks and we've waited 25+ minutes. The staff up until now, has been unattentive and rude."
4,"This is the equivalent of street food in Hamburg.  In the downtown area there are two right across the street from each other.  No place to sit, just stand and eat your sausages. I had the grilled krakauer sausage not the Curry Wurst.  They were awesome."
4,"Just perfect! I could not decide what to eat so I tried everything -aaahhh! Don't regret on single order. All was delish!! Eggs Florentine, vegan pancake, vegan french toast and vegan chocolate cupcake. Best breakfast for dinner I have had in a long while. Kind of glad I don't live here yet. Will definitely come back.You can sit outside or inside. Service is fast and very friendly. They speak German and English. Have great 80s-90s music running in the background. Really in love with the food. Only thing they are missing is glutenfree options. Hope they will add these. I am in love!! Restaurant is close to public transportation, too. You have to come here if you love breakfasts...even for dinner or any time of the day!"
2,Basically currywurst in a different shape while sat at a table. the deserts were great though.
0,"I'm a native Californian.  I know Mexican food well. Sometimes I like it authentic. Sometimes I like it Americanized.  Being a native Californian it is likely I will eat Mexican food or a Mexican-inspired dish for at least one meal a day.  Which is why when I travel I find myself in Mexican restaurants in places like Germany or Scotland. I usually approach these places knowing that they will be pale comparisons to what I can get back home.  And it was with that in mind that I went to Jim Burrito. So when I say it was literally the worst burrito I've ever had, keep in mind that I wasn't expecting it to be as good as something from back home. What was so bad?  I got the Poblano covered burrito. The sauce tasted like dish soap. It was awful. The burrito's fillings were also very wet and lacking flavor. So basically I had a soupy soapy burrito.  The German friend I had with me tried a bite of my burrito after I refused to eat any more, and he also said it was awful.  As I looked around the place I noticed most people ordered the quesadillas. I'm sure that this much simpler recipe of cheese and a tortilla would have been a better choice, and should you find yourself dragged here by German friends, I recommend you keep it simple and order that.I think the most aggravating part of the meal though came when we went to pay.  We brought our dishes back to the counter, and in German the server/host treated us like we had offended him by not eating the awful burrito.  It was bad enough I had to pay for something inedible, but to be treated like we had offended them by not forcing ourselves to eat the awful meal, well that's just ridiculous.  I didn't make a scene, I didn't request the burrito be taken off the bill, instead I vowed silently to myself I'd write this review to warn other travelers away from this place."
0,"Worst place ever, the most not nice people gathered together and work there, if you wanna ruin your night and evening I totally recommend it."
4,"Handy location, homey atmosphere and decent service! I ordered Scholle Finkenwerder Art mit Bratkartoffeln und Salat, which is whole fried plaice (""Finkenwerder style) served with roast potatoes and salad. My boyfriend ordered Labskaus, which is an old, traditional sea farer's dish made from potatoes, beef and beetroot, served with gherkin, beetroot and rollmop. (It is completely gluten free!) We had Zabaione (warm marsalacreme) as the desert. All the food are tasty and well prepared. Very nice place to go if u r searching for northern German taste/gluten free restaurant!"
2,Not sure how this place got such high ratings. We made reservations since we heard it was highly recommended to reserve a table. My husband is a vegetarian and his co-workers told him about the restaurant. Just about everything on the menu had either mushrooms (which I dislike) or eggplant (not a big fan). We ordered a Tassajara Ice Tea which was bitter and not to our liking but we forced it down. I wished I had gotten juice or the Mango Lassi. My husband ordered the mix salad and I ordered the soup. The soup arrive hot and in a rather big bowl for German standards. I was hopeful the Eggplant Curry would be spicy and flavoured but it left a lot to be desired. It was bland and the only bright spot was that it arrived hot. The side salad and rice was tasty but nothing to get excited about. We decided to pass on desserts although they did look rather tasty.
4,"My boyfriend and I are in Hamburg for just a day and we decided to stop here based on the excellent reviews(though only few). You must keep the restaurants appearances out of your impression because the food and the hospitality of the staff make this five star worthy! I had the Wiener schnitzel, which was very flavorful and a huge serving! My boyfriend ate the curry wurst which was also excellent. If we were staying in Hamburg longer we would definitely make another trip here!"
1,Poor service and quite late served. The meet was average but they have a good wine selection. The plates were moving while I was trying the cut the meet because there is not tablecloth at all. I didnt like the atmosphere and the combination with low and high tables. Except for the wine I don't see any reason for coming back.
4,"A long line in front of this place hinted that the reviews were legit. Each scoop was 1.40 EUR, a bit more expensive than usual, but you get a taster of another flavour for free, on top. Onto the ice cream itself: one taste of it and we were hooked: the coconut sorbet is quite simply the best coconut ice cream we've ever tasted. It kind of reminded us of Booja-Booja's Coconut Hullabaloo, until now our favourite - only that Luicella's was ten times better. Pistachio was also very good. Highly recommended!"
3,StrandPauli has a great location at the Hamburg harbour. Its a great place to hang out in the beach chairs enjoying the sun. The service was unfortunately a bit slow especially compared to the amount og people. And it would be nice with some heating lamps and blankets for sundown. Prices were reasonable. I'll be back!!
0,"Just had a dinner as a family of three at Khan. In short: I can not recommend.The meat quality is really low, hygiene is problematic,if you have a baby the only edible stuff is some chicken and sweet stuff.If you leave any food on your plate they will come and warn you and penalize you €5s per person that you did not eat all on your plate.Sorry, no one needs such a dinner."
3,"Tours cost around €15 per person, which seemed a bit much at first.  The tour lasted around 90 minutes, and we took the English one (there is one English tour M-F per day and two on the weekend days).  It walked us through the process to make chocolate and offered 7 samples throughout the process from bean to wrapped chocolate which they made throughout the tour.  Our guide was awesome, and made the whole thing well worth it.  Also, we got to decorate our own bar of chocolate to take home as a souvenir."
0,"The food was good - the service appalling. The server made extremely intrusive and inappropriate comments to my face about my breasts and figure, several times, invited another waiting customer to comment on them, and then called over another worker to share in this frankly appalling objectification of a paying customer and human being. Would never recommend this establishment to any woman who doesn't want to risk being hit on and objectified, and trapped in an extremely uncomfortable situation while your food is in the process of being made Overall - disgusting treatment of female customers, left me feeling revolted and uncomfortable."
3,"A nice place for a decent dinner that does not kill off your retirement account. The pizza's are thin crust and huge (definitely large enough for two hearty eaters. The salads are also nice, and on a nice summer evening their outdoor seating is very nice. Enjoy!"
2,"Located in the middle of Portuguese block this restaurant didn't necessarily disappointed but really didn't have anything special. Food was ok, prices were ok. Drinks were ..... small. Being a Hamburg restaurant, I expected fresher seafood. Being a Portuguese cuisine, I expected more flair... Was let down on both ends, but it did served as an ok lunch."
0,"The building and the menu led us to Wasserschloss.  Made a reservation.  They didn't have the reservation but they made room for us.  That's when it all went badly.  Our server forgot to bring us bread, forgot to bring us wine, forgot to check on us once, and was surprised that we wanted the check so soon.  Terrible service ruined what could have been a great night to remember.  Stay away unless you want ok food with bland memories."
3,"Central Park is open!cozy nice placeA beach club in the middle of schanze! It's close to home, so i guess i'd be spending a lot of saturday and sunday afternoons there!"
4,"Beautiful French restaurant serving fantastic seafood food. Amazing deserts, carefully selected wine and Bouillabaisse à la Marseille will make you come back! Not many dishes on the menu, but along with fish and seafood you'll see one regional (Northern Germany) speciality which brings an intersting twist. Simply but tastefully furnished. Very polite and attentive service.  And what I found pretty amazing, families with kids are welcome. So if you're put off by snobby French restaurants in Hamburg, try Marseille!"
2,"Turmbar is certainly unique. It's a little bar in an old water tower (?) thing. Walking to the bar seemingly takes forever, going round and round in circles. At the top there is a little bar that serves most of what you'd expect. The main problem is the slight lack of windows!"
4,"The food is amazing, once you get into the place it doesn't looks good but it is worth it"
2,Sushi was alright. Staff wasn't directly rude but it felt uncomfortable. On top of that it is very busy and very very loud. Not suited for a relaxed dinner with friends.
4,"This place is amazing. There are three floors of very detailed exhibits. The special exhibit on the history of Germany, a comparison of various time periods, was especially fascinating. I would have enjoyed an accompanying audio tour."
4,"Mix with the locals and treat yourself to a phenomenal casual weekday lunch or early dinner at Fischfeinkost Delikatessen des Meeres (which roughly translates to: Fischfeinkost delicacies of the sea). This place is absolutely phenomenal! If you're a foodie, you have to check it out. If you're not a foodie, you should still check it out. The reviews are super impressive and very well deserved, and popular with the locals it is. Always a great sign, right?Ok, so here's the deal: you enter the space down a few stairs from the street level. You order your dish and a drink at the counter. The place is made up of a pretty cramped connection of tiny rooms with only a few tall tables around. Some with stools. Most without. But in pleasant weather, the great majority of folks are outside on the open sidewalk umbrella-covered tables that are pretty much full of people either enjoying their food or waiting for their food. When they have a bunch of dishes ready, they put them out on the counter and ring a bell. What? No, I'm not kidding. Then a bunch of customers just swoop right in and grab their dishes. Apparently everyone is a regular and already knows the drill, but I still have no idea how people know who gets what or when that bell ring is for them or not. Just bizarre, but it certainly seems to work. These are very happy diners, for sure. Luckily for me, the counter-lady was really sweet and clued in this rather clueless American when my dish was included in which bell ringing round.I had ordered the seafood lasagna w/carpaccio. Sounded amazing, and it certainly was. OMG. Happy me! Delic!! Lovely fresh pasta and veggies in a somewhat deconstructed lasagna style with a lot of yummy broth. Somewhat soupy. Just fantastic. The other dish available that day was a swordfish with potatoes on a bed of greens. Looked amazing and appeared to be the most popular. The Chef creates the menu each day of only 1 or 2 dishes, based on the freshest ingredients available in the markets that day. Brilliant! Simple concept. Simple food. Nothing fancy. Just fantastically prepared super fresh big plates of homey food. Everyone brings out their own flatware/napkin/drink to their tables, picks up their own dish from the counter when ready, and self-busses and drops off their dirty plates when they're done. Highly highly recommended!"
3,"Watched Deutschland lose their World Cup match here, which hurt the mood, but the food and beer were very good. I actually had the best Schweinshaxe ever and most of the time it is pretty good anywhere, you really need at least 2 people so don't order any apps if you go for that glorious piece of pork. Nice friendly service and good place to catch some sports action!"
3,"YES, get a Hamburger in Hamburg!!Fun place, good vibe, youthful crowd. St.Pauli area of Hamburg. English widen spoken. Good music from the 70's & 80's.  HUGE 1/2 lb thick burgers, order them MEDIUM RARE 4 juicy. Tiny ""Hamburger Buns?""( more similar to English muffins....DUDE?! WTF? Soggy fries :-((( even begging first to make them well cooked, they haven't a clue how to cook FF!"
3,"Quan Do's food i good, but the menu is very limited to Pho, fried noodles, weekly offers and some appetizers. BUT nonetheless the Pho I had was delicious as well as the spring rolls. The only thing I didn't like was the staff which was a bit rude (maybe I caught them on a bad day) and the fact that you cannot get Pho to go or take leftovers with you. They only offer a large Pho, which is pretty big, so it's sad that you have to waste the leftovers. Besides that I think the restaurant is great (no sure how much it qualifies as street food though) and I will be going here again!"
3,"Why has nobody ever reviewed Rosi's Bar in English? Could it be because whenever the English end up this far into a St. Pauli weekender they can no longer differentiate between any of the bars on Hamburgerberg?! I suspect so. Anyway, Rosi's trivia: the girl with the dreads from Zoe 2 DJ's here at the weekends sometimes. It's always packed Thursday till Sunday morning. It doesn't look anything like the photo, cause you have to imagine the mass of people sprawled on the pavement. All good fun, and probably better than the Reeperbahn"
3,"Thoroughly enjoyed the experience! I came in during the downtime and got my burger relatively quickly. The atmosphere was relaxing and the burger itself was quite juicy and full of flavor. The fries were pretty fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside - always nice, and having mayonnaise and ketchup for free was a plus. The milk shake I ordered was alright and I was all in all pleased with everything."
4,"We had three nights in Hamburg and we ate here for two of them.  Might've been all three if we had known about it on our first night.  Pizza was great.  Lasagna was fantastic.  Fettuccine Luigi's was incredible.  Tiramisu was super duper. If you arrive after six you can expect a wait.  While you wait they will give you a glass of white wine, but you may feel claustrophobic standing in the narrow hallway especially with patrons going in and out of the bathrooms and the waiters carrying plates of pasta and pizza.  Go here and be happy.  Reasonable prices and portions with a friendly and charming staff."
4,"We hopped in here at 9AM on a Saturday when everything else in the surrounding area was closed until 10. Best decision ever, because the miniatures here on display are amazing! You have some very stereotypical US regions like New Mexico, Nevada, Hollywood, etc., but also some very faithful and amusing representations of Hamburg, other parts of Germany, and other regions of the world.The attention to detail is astounding. Each display has lots of little things to notice, such as a man photocopying his backside in an office building, or a man covered in toilet paper coming out of a port-a-potty. Even underwater or underground displays have little details and secrets to uncover. Even if you're not interested in miniatures (I certainly wasn't) it's still a marvel to behold, and very much worth the ticket price."
0,There really are NO DISGUSTING words that I could possibly muster to perfectly describe what a horrible place this was! From the get go the waiter was such crabby old man- I asked for hoisin sauce he looked at me like I was asking for marinara sauce! Later to give it time I asked for some ice to cool the €9 euro bottle of water that was room temperature & he literally rolled his eyes at me- Seriously? Ok whatever- just bring the dim sum out and be done with it- a few plates of mediocre fare later he brings out what should have been the highlight- Sticky rice wrapped in a lotus leaf- we carefully unwrapped the steamy hot item only to find what looked like a massive dung with no discernible rice grains to speak of- just a big brown turd of mush- still I dissected it as supposedly it contained chicken- which at the very center was a dried up tasteless chicken wing- bone in and just GROSS! I called the crabby old man over and lied that while we enjoyed the other items that this was just inedible- thank you please retire it from the table- which he did- I felt bad for having returned something so I asked for another small plate of dim sum to make up for it- but when the bill came to my surprise he had charged me for the lotus wrapped pile of ... and so I said to him- I'm sorry but you forgot to remove this from my bill- and he insisted that he would not take it off my bill that I HAD TO PAY!  I was indignant at how utterly preposterous this was- I have rarely returned anything and when I have the service has been apologetic and settled quickly- the crab would not let up and the scene he was making in the restaurant had me on pins and needles- there's a price for dignity and it was obvious his was €6 euros! NEVER EAT HERE if you're in Hamburg! Try the Dim Sum Haus literally around the corner! Bon Appetit! Just NOT at the Mei Moon-
4,mr t burger changed my life! chipotle chilli sauce is digusting but every taste is different. the portion of sweet potatoe fries is too small for 4 EUR. overall its one of the best burger i had so far. thanks mates!
2,"Came here with work colleagues for something to eat.  As it was a nice day, we sat outside.  A casual arrangement on benches which means you may have to share a table with others but this is part of the atmosphere.  Of course the outside is probably more popular with the smokers so us non-smokers have to suffer the odd whiff of smoke in our direction.  A popular social area, there are street performers so if you are lucky you may get some live music as you dine.  Down side is that you can also get approached by beggars.Extensive menu of Japanese food from sushi, curries, noodles, rice dishes etc,  I think you would be hard pushed not to find something to eat.I opted for the Salmon Teriyaki which was nice if not a little too salty with a little too much sauce.  Nevertheless I ate it all.  My sushi loving companion loved their sushi dish.No pressure to move on once you have finished and so you can chill out with a beer after you have eaten also.Staff friendly (menus in German but then I didn't ask for an English one) and good value for money €65 for 4 of us with drinks and tip in that price."
4,Cozy and unique.I love this bar/lounge! Definitely will come back again since it has a wonderful indoor and big outdoor seating. The sofas are really stylish and probably even antique! The walls are just a master piece... its just a great place to have a drink with friends and chill out.
2,"Not really for my taste, i think it was a bit overpriced for what we got. Ambient was nothing special. The staff was actually very nice and friendly"
2,It was good to try German traditional type of foods. I liked the restaurant itself and so on. But the fish was very salty for me maybe it's because I'm not German
4,"Short version: I love eating at Dean & DavidLong version: I am the biggest lover of meat and cheese so when My doctor said I needed to change my diet I was Glum, I thought you couldn't get nice food that was not full crap.  My girlfriend and I started looking for nice places that were a bit healthier and Dean & David hits the mark perfectly.I am a major fan of the Warm Thai Beef Salad and my girlfriend particularly likes the Parisian Salad, both of us are working through the juices and I am a particular fan of the Ginger Shot although it is not quite as tangy as the ginger juices we make at home.The branch at the Europa Passage is just by my work which is handy for a quick snack or juice but has limited seating space so I prefer to come here when we will sit a bit longer and enjoy our food at the slower pace."
4,"If you have ever wondered what it is like to be in India then Jaipur Indian Restaurant is the place to go! Once you walk in you are transported by the smells, the decor and they friendly staff. The carved wood chairs and the music set the mood as you sit down and are presented with a list of mouth watering delicacies. You will want to try them all and you should. I found the best way to experience Jaipur is to come with a group of friends and order a range of different dishes and share it family style. This way you get a little taste of everything so when you decide to come back again you know exactly what you want. The spices, the textures, the flavors, it all combines in your mouth and it leaves you wanting more. Even if your mouth has a 4 alarm fire going on you can wash it down with a cool, creamy, mango lassi! The cold yogurt drink put the fire out while still being able to enjoy the flavors you love. The staff is just the icing on the cake. One of the most friendliest, helpful, and quick staff I have come across in a long time. The prices are average and if you want to make a night of it I would suggest heading over to the English Theatre for a show or walk down the street and party the night away with some cosmic bowling! Jaipur Indian Restaurant is a must! I expect all of you to be lining up at the door the next time I visit."
3,As a british man Indian curries are extremely important to us as they are our nation's favourite.  The service was polite and authentic as was the choice of two Indian beers. My wife chose a wine and it was very nice which is rare in a curry house and we shared the 2 person tandoori platter. It was a lot of food but very very nice.
4,"Although I had I pretty bad flu since the week before, I couldnt resists to join this event. Even though it appeared to be my first night as the Qype City Night host. So after all I joined the group around twentyhundret-and-a-bit: a bunch of more than 25 heads, that made their way to the GOLDEN, a place being criticized in november last year by myself in a pretty harsh but discussable way. Therefore I was pretty excited how both - the restaurantsowner and the qype community - would reflect on the upcoming event. Bearing a pretty poor stomach for almost a week in mind, I decided to choose from the menu, beginning with a chinese mushroom soup with chicken. Great choise! Delicious and tasty. Then there was some Dim Sums and in the end another shark-fin-soup (what-so-ever the english equivalent may be called). Please refer to both english and german feedbacksregarding the GOLDEN. As I dont like to edit my german comment from november `06, I have to get the GOLDEN five stars and two-thumbs-up from this end. That night was awesome! Thanks to Mr. Wong."
4,"A cosy place, next to u2 Hauptbahnhof. From ordering to getting food is just in a short while. Totally in  with their chicken avocado bowl. Absolutely recommend this place for everyday healthy lunch"
4,"Dank stinking grungy hole of a bar. Which I like. We saw a pretty intense gig on Saturday night (experi-mental rock), hooked up with some randoms and crashed a house party afterwards. If you don't like overheated, overcrowed hellholes... stay away!"
4,"Like its St. Georg outlet cousin, Luicella's deserves the long line-ups on warm days - simply for the quality of their great ice cream. And given the location, you might even find more days without those long line-ups.This is a smaller place with a smaller assortment, and it's lacking the cute seating spaces.But they stock all their favorites, they will also give you an additional flavor to try out, and the taste is simply awesome."
4,"The best coffee we had in Hamburg. Espresso as good as i Italy. Lots of people to look at, and excellent place to blend in and watch sct. Pauli meet schanzen..."
4,"When I moved to HH from California, I thought that I would never find a bowl of guacamole, let alone a decent enchilada. Then I found Cafe Mexico. This is the real deal. The family who runs this charming cafe come from Mexico City, and they cook The Best enchiladas in Hamburg. The mole (a rich dark sauce made with chocolate, spices and nuts) is heavenly. The chilaquiles are great too...come to think of it, EVERYTHING is tasty here. And the tequila selection....yummmmmmmm. The decor is right out of Mexico, with the Virgin of Guadalupe and lots of cacti watching over the diners. Love it! And the service is just as it is in Mexico--mellow and friendly. Prices are quite reasonable. Cafe Mexico is a bright spot of sunshine. When friends say that they've never eaten Mexican food (or they think Mexican is just fajitas or Tex-Mex), we bring them here. I would eat here once a week if I lived closer to the Schanze!"
3,"Cute place for a brunch in summer.Outdoor seatings however arent the most comfortable. The crowd is made of families, groups of friends, couples, business meetings. The brunch buffet doesn't offer a very wide choice, however it has the basics: cheese, salami, bread, eggs, müsli .."
4,bestice creamevertry snickers!! It was incredible and I would go there any time. Little expensive but totally worth it
4,Must see place in Hamburg! I have been here many years ago when I was little and I loved it and now grow up I saw how even more amazing this is. They are making more and more new exibitions and you dont need to be child to enjoy the plesure of this place ;)
3,"The name Mr. Kabob gave me with the expectation of a quick fast food counter. While the food is quick, it's actually a comfy and cozy cafe with take away or table service/eat in options. Large windows let in sunlight and pillows line the bench. They also have several small tables outside along the cafe. The other surprise was the size of the Donner kabob I ordered. They have bread and rolled options, I went with the bread and it was huge. The bread was soft, slightly toasted and warm. The chicken inside was really good as was the sauce, my only real complaint was wanting more sauce, more evenly distributed. They also use a cabbage mix for the veggies, while my personnel presence is just lettuce along with the tomato and cucumber.Good price, good food, friendly staff."
4,"We found La Trattoria on Yelp, and decided to drive over for a Saturday lunch outing. It was a rainy summer day, but the restaurant was open to the air, and an awning covered a few tables that were outside on the sidewalk.La Trattoria has a fairly standard bound Italian restaurant menu (antipasti, pastas, pizzas), then they have a chalkboard of what must be seasonal specials (or just recommendations) for lunch, and then there's a second chalkboard of daily specials. The waiter (who seemed like he must also be the manager) was friendly and got us a seat right away, tried a few jokes with our daughter, and was patient explaining the options.My wife had the cheese-filled ravioli with truffle cream sauce, which was excellent. There were seven or eight good-sized ravioli filled with some kind of firm-ish cheese, and covered in a very decadent truffle cream sauce. I ordered the daily special of chanterelles in a cream sauce over homemade papardelle; it was incredibly good. Lots of mushrooms, good portion size, and tons of flavor in every bite. Being six, our daughter ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce, and managed to eat about half of the giant ""kids"" portion (which she finished with gusto at home the next day).We also ordered tiramisu and tartufo for dessert. The tartufo was just okay, but the tiramisu was quite good. Overall, we loved our experience here, and will definitely be back."
4,"I'm always a little leery of expensive restaurants with a great view. Most of the time it feels like you're only paying for the view and the food is an afterthought. Not the case here. The food is fresh, innovative and fantastic. The service is great. The view is amazing."
2,"Touristy, of course at this location. The menus were just kind of thrown on the table and the waiter walked away. He was very busy. Music playing so softly I couldn't even make out what kind of music was playing. Quite without atmosphere, this restaurant.Food was served quickly and tasted good. The waiter didn't come to check on us at any time though.Toilets not very clean, not dirty.. Something in the kitchen he middle. Free WiFi. I think that it's a good place to have a quick bite for a fair price close to the docks. Defiantly not a romantic place for a date!"
3,"When in China, I learned that the quality of restaurants there does typically not correlate with its interior. So I wasn't worried that the ""Chinese am Fleet"" is located about as unpoetically as you can go in Hamburg, and oozes that cheap corner Chinese charme of decades lost. At the off time I visited, the only other customer was a Chinese-looking guy slurping his rice, which I took as a good omen as far as buy-in by the Chinese community at large.""Chinese am Fleet"" seems to cater to two kinds of customers: the lunch break crowd seeking hearty grub for 7€, and people craving authentic yet inexpensive Chinese dishes for a few more bucks (expect 12-16€ for most dishes). Second group, the first two pages in the menu are for you!There is much variety to choose from, with a spiciness warning for most of the authentic dishes. Portion sizes are very generous - obviously you'll have more fun as a group to share Chinese-style, otherwise this will likely be a very meat-focused experience. The pork belly dish I sampled tasted really good, rich and fatty as it should be, nicely seasoned.Don't worry too much about the spiciness warning - even at the highest rating, the food remains nicely edible. Thai nationals will still need to apply some extra chili.So - it's not the most authentic or best Chinese dining experience I had in Germany, but can more than hold its candle among Hamburg's everyday Chinese options."
3,"Hubby took me here for my birthday. Our reservation had requested a seat by the window so we can enjoy the view but we were seated at a table next to a table by the window; we asked if we could take the empty one by the window but were told the table was reserved. It actually remained empty the whole time we were there, so that was a disappointment.We ordered the Chateaubriand for two which comes with a total of four sides and two sauces, so we got the asparagus, broccoli, roasted veggies and truffle fries. As you can see we tried to even out the meat with all the veggies. For the sauce we got the truffle and lobster - both were rich and full of flavor, but we both liked the truffle one best. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and was flavorful and tender. The sort-of table side service (since the steak is cut in the dining room but at a special station vs next to your table) made it seem quite fancy. For dessert we got the coconut sorbet sans ""Happy Birthday"" message despite hubby making the request with our reservation. Except for the restaurant seemingly not reading the special request in our reservation, this was a nice indulgent night out. The food was good and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, and the view is hard to beat."
4,"One of my 'locals' anytime of the year. As a non-meat eater, I can't comment on the 'Haxe' or even the fish, but the appetizers are great, and never cease to satisfy. With a bottle of retsina and an ouzo or two, a meal at Nostalgia is always worthwhile."
3,"I've now been here three times and can say I think the food is stupidly good for the price (~6€ per meal). I've ordered the palak paneer thali the last two times and would highly recommend this dish (spinach with cheese cubes).This is a pretty small place with authentic Indian food served on metal trays. You order at the counter, get a buzzer, then pickup your food, which is divided into entree, rice, yogurt, side salad, side chickpeas, and naan. Everything is really fresh tasting and delicious, besides the small salad which is really boring (but whatever, ignore it). I could easily recommend this place if you want some authentic Indian food."
4,This restaurant has lots of vegan choices which are delightful and the service is always friendly! It's a restaurant I always love coming back to!
1,"I was here 3 times. The first 2 times I came here with one person. The food were super super good, then I brought my other 3 friends here with full expectations but we all were disappointed this time. May be we came there at a wrong time (Easter time) or their main chef is on holiday, no idea. They offer Surprises Menu all the time. The first 2 time (2 persons), we had 6 warm+cold appentisers but this time 4 persons only had 5 appentisers and the portion was the same as for 2 persons. The beef was tough and no sauce for the whole dish. When we asked for a ketchup or sauce and they answered it is not their practice to offer sauce. We are very disappointed and don't know what is going on in this restaurant."
3,"Food = awesome and that is my main motivation to come here. Service is hit or miss and when outside seating isn't possible, the berlin-hipster interior style isn't so much my thing. But if you're coming for the food, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a super hungry boy. You might need a starter then too, so I hear). Enjoy!"
2,"Clearly a place to be in Hamburg.  After queuing for 20 min with the others, I could finally see the menu. Overall typical vietnamese choice. Nothing too extravagant.It took them a while to come and take my order.The food was OK, but nothing more. The pho missed fresher herbs and was quite salty. The spring rolls were fresh and crispy as they should be but the dip was rather tasteless. The pork on the bun cha lacked juiciness but had a good taste. Overall the bun was quite cold.All in all not bad, but maybe not worth the wait..."
4,"Best Indian food I've had in Hamburg thus far. Went here on an impulse with coworkers for lunch. Little hole in the wall place with amazing food at incredibly low prices. We shared an appetizer of veggie samosas. Love the way it was plated with a variety of dips at all degrees of heat from none to more than some. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Thali, it contained a moderate hint of heat which was enjoyable. My dish came with chicken, rice, yoghurt, a mini salad, bean/legume side, and naan. It was hard to believe all this was just €5.50. After seeing my coworker's plate of Chili Chicken Thali, I think I will have to try that next time to test just how spicy it might be."
4,"You like tabletop gaming and mead? This is the place for you!A wonderful little basement bar that's full of cliches and atmosphere. From the medieval style kitsch decor to the barrells full of games (literally! the barrells have latched doors and when you open them, boom, plethora of tabletop games inside) this is a theme bar not to be missed!Bring a few friends, grab a table and a board game and enjoy a mead or two. Or come on your own and make new friends! Several of their games have English versions as well and they have Wasabi, which is a quick dice game with instructions in fifteen or so languages. It does get quite crowded on weekends and evenings, but go and have a look anyway, you might be lucky and grab a nice spot. Definitely one of my faves in the city."
4,"Very good restaurant, a little price for a tasty food. Ask their noodles if you don't have too much ideas."
3,I had the vegan pancakes called Roxen. It was served with fruits and apple puree. The portion was really huge. Next to that I ordered a lactose free cappuccino with oat milk. I was only able to eat one of the twopancakes. The pancakes could be a little bit sweeter. The atmosphere is cozy and hip. The service was good and friendly.
4,"A lot of Asian food in Germany is ""verdeutscht"" as is a significant amount of Asian food Americanized in the States. But coming from NY, you get such a wide array of pretty authentic Asian dishes. Bok avoids becoming like the throngs of fast food noodle joints in Hamburg and offers up some of the best Asian food, I think, you'll get in Hamburg."
3,"Sit-down service only. I was early for an appointment and stopped in to get a latte macchiato to go. No paper cups = no coffee to go. :-( Too bad. I could imagine picking up a coffee and then strolling around in the park across the street afterwards. Regardless, the place looks extremely cute and was seemingly full for the time of day and time of week. I will come back and try out the food. UPDATE: Had some time this week to relax at a cozy table and enjoy a cup of coffee with the fluffiest milk foam I've seen in a while. It's the end of winter and from where I'm sitting, there's a perfect view of the Antebellum Gossler House up on the hill. This is such a cute place. Antiques carefully selected give this place real charm and character and warmth. While enjoying the dusk and eavesdropping to whispered conversations in the next room, I made my next happy discovery: the best cheesecake this side of the Atlantic - moist, like those in the US, without being too heavy."
4,I guess Stadtpark is the main park in Hamburg. It's certainly one of the bigger parks and is the best set up to cater for you having a good time: - There are a few beer gardens scattered through the park- There is a huge outdoor swimming pool- There is a huge lawn that people are always barbecuing on- There is an impressive planetarium- There is a boating lake- There is a large outdoor amphitheater where many large bands play (I've seen Neil Young there and also The National) etc. etc.
3,"Great place. Nice view to the B+V docks, good variety of drinks, nice food. Stinky toilets."
4,Boys and girls if you like rock music and if you are looking for one of the best rocking pubs in hamburg this is the place to go!
3,"""Create you own salad"" places are really hard to find in Europe and look no further people because this is one of them! So excited to be able to build my own salad. You pick a base four toppings and a protein. The salads come with a slice of bread and I found the small salad to be quite filling. The mint tougher dressing was really tasty and refreshing so I definitely recommend it. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating and not very crowded for lunch!"
3,"Really nice new-ish place on the catwalk that is Schuterblatt, hence, a bloody good venue from which to enjoy a cold Augustinabrau. The signs on the toilet doors to indicate the correct genders permitted are not to be missed!"
0,"Absolutely disappointing.Burgers barely have any substance, the homemade ice tea was terrible and there is no service"
4,"We have a 1 year old that's constantly moving, so lately we've been getting a lot of meals to go. We went in on Sunday, a little after 9 am. Oma's staff was super nice when we asked for the food to go and also got us coffee while we waited. I've not been impressed with some of the  coffee I've tried so far in the neighborhood, but this was wonderful. I really liked the restaurant itself. Just laid back and cozy. Would've loved to actually stay and eat there if not for the toddler. I'm sure it would've been fine if we had stayed, but it's just not fun for us to eat and chase him at the same time. The food itself was great. Pancakes/maple syrup and Breakfast 1. Exactly what we wanted on a Sunday morning."
0,"The W O R S T fish I've had in Hamburg so far!I'll keep it simple stupid:1. The place reeks. 2. The quality of the fish is horrendous as it is frozen and flavourless. 3. Even the sides are not fresh and every bit of nutrition cooked out of them. They only got one star because the staff was friendly. However, I don't go to restaurants because the staff is friendly."
