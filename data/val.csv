4,"Busy meat lovers restaurant, good atmosphere, friendly service. Quite expensive but worth the money as the steak is good quality, you can even watch them cook your steak for you! Jacket (Baked potato) is served with steaks and is very tasty!"
3,"When I'm hungry and I'm in the Reeperbahn area this is my favourite spot to get some fast food. Their Pide is really tasty, I'd definitely recommend it and they make it right in front of you. I've never been bothered to try anything else apart from it though , but they've got even Kebap here."
2,"I'm glad I went, but I also wish I spent more time on the Reeperbahn during my stay in Hamburg, and this is what I would cut out. It was a fun experience that's not too far away from other things you'll probably want to see, but it wasn't as educational or informative as I thought it would be.I went alone, and ended up being the only person on the submarine for most of my time down there. I was creeped out a lot more than I thought - it's a really tight and dark space with terrible gas fume smells. There's a loud engine room, but the rest of the space has fake sonar ping audio being piped in. There's little camera lenses cut into various walls so the people in the office can watch you as you browse through, but other than that, you're free to go at your own pace - provided there's enough room for others to squeeze by. Also, I'm really hoping all the white fibrous insulation isn't asbestos.All the original signage and instruments are in Russian (which is awesome) and there's some English signs showing what rooms were used for. Don't go if you have any mobility issues, you will be climbing up and through awkward holes.If you're looking for something nearby that might be more interesting, I thought the Alter Elbtunnel that goes under the river with a massive elevator for cars was pretty exciting."
3,"If you want to try out some authentic mexican food and drink way too much Tequila then this is the place to come. I had an enchilada like never before. Cocoa sauce, which sounds odd but is actually pretty delicious. The staff were pretty attentive dashing back and forth with the lime, salt, tequila and san miguel. A good place to have a works party as it's going to be pretty quiet midweek, and so you can take over the bar. With my recently discovered love of burritos, it made me one step closer to believing that the best cuisine and venues are mexican. Will be going back to see what the burritos are like."
4,"The staff is extremely friendly, the atmosphere transports you to the streets of Italy and the coffee and food are great too! It does not get any better. ** They only accept cards for orders over 10 euro (found that out the hard way - but they were nice enough to allow me to come back later to pay for my cappuccino!)"
4,By far the best Kebab I ever had. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. So is the service. The ideal place to spent afternoons with a good book and you diary. They also serve an excellent coffee.
2,"The number one selling point of Daniela bar is that it's busy at 3am on a Monday. Not many other bars can claim that. It's very popular and very small, and in my mind very much an ending bar - somewhere i'd only really go to because I wanted one more drink, and nowhere else was open."
4,"Those pancakes doe, for everyone who has been to Pancake-countries such as Canada or the US and then is craving for real thick yummy pancakes, needs to go to Mamalicious! This is the No. 1 spot for pancakes in Hamburg. I will never forget that day when I went to Mamalicious for the first time and a lady passed by and took pics of our food because it looked so incredibly gooood!"
3,On the way into Deichgraf there is an inconspicuous little photo on a table in the hallway. If you stop to look at it you'll notice that it's a photo of Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder in the restaurant! I guess that means this place is well regarded. The restaurant is certainly well decorated with antique furniture and original paintings. THe prices are medium-high rather than mega-expensive. Myself and two friends had lunch here for EUR30. I don't know what my meal was called but it was delicious and being the lunch special was only EUR8.80.
4,"Just wow! Extremely friendly and helpful staff, impressive food! Anytime! 100% recommendation!"
2,"The food is what one typically finds in Greek restaurants in Hamburg. The atmosphere is nicer than in many places, but often loud. It's a great place for a dinner out with a group of friends, but not the ideal place for a quiet dinner in two."
4,"This place is a winner! And who would have known? It's hidden behind Osterstrasse, not far from U-Bahn, impossible to spot.Come and try if you like- wine- modern ambiance- yummy snacks- relaxing summer terrace - good serviceAbout wines: open wine selection is not that extensive, but you can buy any bottle (and they have a great choice), have it served at you table in restaurant with additional 7 eur and bottle of water for free. Not cheap but worth visiting at least once. My five stars."
4,The best fucking Turkish food in Hamburg. I've been trying different places all week and non of them can compare to here. They use real tandoori ovens and charcoal grill it's truly fucking amazing. Plus the owner is so nice and speaks English. If you're in Hamburg this place is a must I could eat here daily.
3,"1. bad service but good spicy food.2. I'm not a fan of spicy food but I still want to recommend this restaurant for people who like the real Asian food. Because including me, all Asians who like spicy food would go there. At least, the best one in Hamburg. ( Frankfurt has a better spicy food restaurant in my mind haha) 3. only accepting cash!"
3,"Excellent kebab house with innovative queuing system. You queue, order, pay and take a ticket - then find a seat and your food arrives in about 3 mins! I recommend the mix teller - wholesome plate of lots of stuff. I always get this as the menu choices are baffling. The battered fish looks interested but I've never had it thus far. Friendly staff and bargin basement prices. Worth a go."
4,Delicious traditional food. Typical for the portuguese food is fish.We were in a group of six people and got our food all at the same time. Nice service. Price was ok. A reservation is highly recommended.
4,this place is great! good fresh pizza made fast with whatever toppings you want. and it's totally cheap too. i found my pizza joint
2,Fast service. Decent food. Nothing special but delivers what is expected. Caesar salad was more dressing than salad. My kids loved the place. Go figure.
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining, albeit oftentimes too loud. Everyone wants to be ""most important"". Whatever, these are all trust-fund babies or advertising drones and they never change wherever you are.The food is mediocre at best but there are some highlights. The place is not consistent which is probably the biggest complaint about their food. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow.....I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that threw it off. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish and we both do regularly get the Caesar salad, which actually is more like a chicken-teriyaki salad. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this and you go here knowing what you're going to get. At least the crowd is consistent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table. Of course, if you want to show off your Porsche, Ferrari, or Lambo, you can park it right out front and there are a lot of windows so that everyone WILL see that it's you. If you feel ignored, rev the engine a couple times......it's usually loud inside."
4,"delicious! good service with fast serving food. the menu changes everyday. limited choices but that also means, they perfected those dishes. only downside is, they do not open during the weekend and it closes fairly early in the evening."
4,"Great burgers and atmosphere. This is my favorite place in town, I've been there with friends several times and we all love it. I recommend the Gonzalez and the Big Rock Burgers, and if you are looking for a vegetarian option, the Black Beans Burger is really good. I highly recommend this place for a casual and relaxing dinner, just come with a bit of patience. Reservations are advisable for groups and weekend nights."
3,"I've been here twice and had different experiences each time.The first time was amazing. Everything tasted fresh and the spices were all combined perfectly to make a really delicious and aromatic meal.The second time wasn't quite as good. The curry was great, but the rice just didn't seem properly cooked. In fact, the whole meal just didn't seem fresh enough.Although the service does seem a bit comatose, I will say that the staff didn't fall short when it came to problem resolution. They replaced a drink that we were dissatisfied with free of charge  no attitude whatsoever, despite the fact that it was obviously our fault for ordering the wrong drink to begin with.The prices are a bit high and it seems the quality can be inconsistent, but overall  a decent place to grab some good Asian food."
4,Authentic Cantonese food!   Large selection.   We enjoyed both the Dim Sum and dinner dishes.    The Kung Pao Shrimp was especially good.
3,"Great vegan restaurant. The food is tasty, the place is cosy and the crew is cool. Best vegan quiche I ever eat !  The blueberry pie is great too.The missing star is for the really slow service : 40 minutes to get my dish."
4,"I have a fairly high bar for a food establishment to get a 5-star rating. I don't eat out a ton but, when I do, it's with the expectation of having an experience that I couldn't easily replicate at home (for half the cost and no travel time).We went to TrüffelSchwein to celebrate Valentine's Day. Even though it fell on a Sunday (when they're normally closed), they opened up for the special day and had a custom menu going. The dishes were mostly pulled from their regular menus with some customizations here and there. Still, points for opening on Sunday and printing a themed menu.Ambience: perfect. The dining room is intimate but gives each table enough room to have its own conversation. They have an outdoor space, but it was (1) February in Hamburg and (2) pouring rain. I'm sure it's amazing in the summer, though. The decor is relaxed upscale, not that I'm-rich-look-at-me feel that you'll find in most other Michelin-rated restaurants in Hamburg. It's classy yet comfortable, a nice-jeans-and-blazer vibe. For the occasion, they had rose petals on the tables, a perfectly elegant touch.Service: nailed it. That alone earns them their Michelin star for me. Their timing and delivery are impeccable. They're there to top off your water or wine seconds before you realize you need a refill. The courses are perfectly spaced out and presented. They give you space to enjoy your dining experience but magically show up moments before you even notice you need something. When our waitress heard us speaking English (and clearly butchering any German we spoke with her), she smoothly switched over to English without any hesitation. When we continued in German ('cause we're stubborn fools), she switched back again without missing a beat. Top notch professionalism, folks.Food: everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and superbly plated. We went for the 4-course menu paired with gin martinis and a white wine, which was just the perfect amount. That menu includes a bread basket with truffle butter and tapenade and two amuse-bouches.When it comes to higher-end restaurants, TrüffelSchwein is absolutely worth the splurge, more so than the 185€ you'd have to shell out at Haerlin just for food in my book. I look forward to returning to TrüffelSchwein in the future."
3,"Been here a few times. Cozy little place with a good selection of burgers to choose from. Love the fries too. You usually order up front at the counter. For the non german speaking folks, the lady behind the counter asks if you want ketchup or mayonnaise with your fries, and if it's a take away or not. The service is quick, and there is outdoor seating available if it's summer (and not raining)."
0,"Did this Place shut down ? I can not reach anyone by Phone ( the Number you have dialed is unavailable ""040 43183050"" and the Website ist down and Domain for Sale !Does anyone know more about this ?"
0,Awful service. Rate 1star just because there is no option of 0star rating. Big disappointment
3,"We went there for early dinner on our last night in Germany. The place was packed though the food came out at reasonable time. We ordered medium spicy chicken wings for starter. It was good but very spicy for us so we suggest if you want mild, choose the bbq variety instead. For the main course we had hickory bbq burgers served with fries on the side. The buns were brioche so it's softer than the usual burer buns. For dessert, we had hot fudge sundae which is my favorite. It taste better than it looks! My bf had a beer while I got a .75l of water. Our bill came at around €60. It costs more than our usual budget but we enjoyed the food anyway and it's our last day in our Germany vacation. It is not a quiet restaraunt. And don't expect so much if you want to be seated by the window with a nice view. I am not sure if they accept table booking because the feature on the website was not working when we tried."
4,"I loved it! So much food, friendly staff, cool environment! But don't forget to make a reservation."
3,"A good spot! Menu is heavy on burgers (probably shouldn't be surprised, though), but the salad -- the salad was amazing. Still thinking about it a day later. If I were here longer I'd go back!"
4,"Lovely food! Cosy atmosphere!We wanted vegetarian food, but don't speak German too well...The waitress however spoke excellent english, and gave us some options instead.We ended up with some amazing antipasti, and delicious truffle pasta.I can also highly recommend the Creme Brulee ;)Also looked to be a great fish selection, and would love to come back and try it!"
2,"If anything, this is a wonderful place to lunch or dine outside in the shade of old trees at the end of the Bleickenallee. The choice is also more varied than the run-of-the-mill Italian. My vitello tonnato was excellent and the smell of my companion's tagliatelli with scampi mouthwatering. What a pity that the panna cotta didn't live up to the expectations: it was tough (too much gelatine) and bland in taste (no rasped lemon peel or something else that could have enlivened the taste). Still, overall a good choice"
4,"Food was good, vegetarian and fairly-priced! It was a little hard to find a seat, but that is always a good sign :)"
2,"Was there last thursday night and it was absolutely crowded. We managed to get a bar table, which wasn't one of the most comofortable seats since the chairs had no support to lean on. I had ratatouille filled baked potatoe gratinated in cheese and with creme fraiche. It was good, but not a stand out, but I wasn't disappointed. (They have better baked potatoes at other places in hamburg such as Kumpir in Sternschanze and for half the price too). All in all it was a nice evening. We got our food very quickly. Edit: I was there again last friday with 3 friends. I had the vegetarian flammenkuchen. They used mushrooms from a can. I hate when restaurants don't use fresh mushrooms. Again, the restaurant was crowded, but neither food or service was more than average, so I lower it to 3 stars. We went to 15 restaurants and bars in hamburg iover the weekend and this was the worst of them. However it doesn't really say much since the rest of them were excellent."
3,I am a bit harsh sometimes: They really improved and Tim and his team are doing a great job.It is a shame I cannot stop by more often.Love their lunch options with seafood!
4,"Fantastic little restaurant!Great staff and food. We had a good time dining here. The restaurant doesn't have a menu but tells you the different food that day. There was no a problem making a vegetarian option for my friend, and they made fresh homemade pasta filled with pear. Never tried it before, but it was fantastic!The area outside (Hansaplatz) is a bit shady with people sitting outside drinking all day."
3,"The smallest venue Ive probably ever been to- so small you have to exit and wait out front when bands are setting up their gear on stage- which can be rather cold in the winter... Cool little place under the railway lines which generally has shows from local or small bands on tour- 6 Euros will usually get you in a show- which is a great way to discover new music in a cool environment. The Astra Stube seems like a Hamburg instuition of sorts and they almost had to close this December, but were able to extend their lease for a few more years- so go support local/independent live music!"
1,"Extremely dissapointing. We went there for a casual family dinner in the winter of 2016. The location is nice-harbour view. I am pretty sure that in summer, the restaurant will be a great attraction. The staff is very polite, atmosphere is neat, clean and stylish. However the food was not that great. Firstly, they gave some fresh warm bread with a tomato sauce, which was delicious. But then, the starter-Bouillabaisse was bland. No proper seasoning, taste, it was too watery. For entry, I ordered turbot wrapped in bacon and risotto. Risotto was well done, but the fish was raw, it was probably frozen. The vegetables next to it was just way too bitter and overcooked. I do not know why the vegetables turned out greyish brown, but there was way too much lemon and/or ginger that made it too bitter I think. I did not order any dessert, however I did tasted my mom's dish, which was creme brulee and white chocolate mousse. There was nothing special with the mousse. I wish they put some liquor to make it more interesting. The creme brulee was way too hard. The top must crack as soon as you hit it lightly with your spoon but we had to use some force. The taste of the dessert was alright, but in my opinion not being able to cook soup, fish, vegetables, creme brulee is simply dissapointing for this restaurant.In conclusion, I would only go to this place in summer, to drink wine or beer, to enjoy the view. I would not pay for the food."
4,"Loved this place! Shabby chic all the way! What a cool concept, so comfy it's like sitting on your sofa at home but with the added benefit of table service! The baileys coffee was luuuuuuvly."
3,"Stylish place just past the Mercado, about 3 mins walk from Altona station. It's fairly dark and swanky, but the prices aren't too inflated with an Augustina Brau at a fairly standard EUR3.50 a bottle. Good, and indeed, good looking, service, and cool beats. There's a smoking room out the back but down let your friends trick you into sitting in there as it's bloody freezing!"

4,"Yes, I love this place, even though I thought I ordered meat on my pizza, but ended up with peppers instead. Oh well, I guess something got lost in translation. (my own bad). You can choose from various ingredients and combine your own pizza. Superb! Pizza tasted good, nice crunch to it and the pizza sauce was a nice surprise! Price was ok as well. Its just a little walk from Reeperbahn, so not far from public transport. Would love to have a place like this as my neighbour. Free wifi as well."
3,"Cooko is offering a Great vararity of Vietnamese and Asian dishes. Thus everyone should find something on the menu. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the dishes are freshly & fast prepared."
3,"A very good pizza. Although wouldn't be bad if they would cut the pizza or bring a pizza knife/roller. The place is nice, cool and the service is very nice and warm."
1,"After having ordered my burger, I almost had to wait for one (!) hour. After about 40 minutes, I enquired into the reasons for the delay and I was told, that there was a huge backlog of orders...Mhmm. Also: EC-Card payments available only for amounts above 15€. No credit cards accepted! Wouldn't consider it a pleasant costumer experience."
4,"On my travels I use to allow myself at least one dinner in a nice restaurant. This is definitely one restaurant that I would recommend to everybody making a stop in Hamburg. Forget stars and point! Nice place (and if you're luck to have seats in front of the canal it is really amazing!!), very welcoming staff, great dishes (maybe portions are too big) but presentation and quality have been really surprising. Price and quality give a really high rate to this cosy restaurant where decoration and staff make you feel at home!"
1,"- this place is way way over rated- very friendly service and good beer, and place is always full which is fun. - also very family friendly so that's all good, however the steaks and the burger are really not great.- steaks look ok and are cooked ok, but they just do not taste of much unfortunately, you will not find any good variety Scottish, Argentinian or Swiss staff here.- unfortunately I also have to score their burger down. The New York cheeseburger is not in fact a burger. The meat tastes like an Italian meatloaf, and it's basically served on a crusty half slice Italian bread, with thin chips and cheese. It tastes ok, but it should be called the Italian sandwich not a cheese burger.- unlikely that I will eat steak or burger her again"
0,"The service was TERRIBLE and the food was mediocre at best. I had high expectations for this restaurant since they served American style breakfast. As a fellow American, I could have stayed home and made my own pancakes. Their pancakes were not moist and the chocolate chips were not cooked within the pancake. The sandwich my husband order could have been made in 10 minutes at most. It was just a sandwich with tomato, lettuce, and fake bacon. It took over 45 minutes to deliver our food! I'm not sure why this place has high ratings."
3,"We were visting the Bistro, not the Brasserie, so cannot comment on the latter. Further, we had the meal as part of the hotel's package, so any comments on whether it's price-worthy I cannot made. It was quite ok. Food was good (although the kids had a better choice, IMO) and the service was friendly. The only criticism I have, and it's something which happens in many places: Service was efficient while the place was packed, but later on, with fewer guests, there weren't many around anymore."
3,My first time in a vegan restaurant and I gotta say it was really delicious. As a vegetarian it was also nice to be able to just look at the menu and know that I can order anything I want without having to think about it because it's all-vegan! The restaurant is also really pretty and the people were very nice.
0,"Ok, before I start this review I have to say that the food is actually good and authentic. However, that is the only positive thing about this place. Let's talk about the food first.We ordered the pork udon and that was pretty tasty, even better than some of the udon places in California. The pork was flavorful and so was the broth. The agedashi tofu I got tasted good as well, but the portions were so tiny we literally got a cube of tofu per person. Next, my beef bowl was good too! The meat was tender and flavorful.Sigh. The restaurant itself looked so worn down. The chairs were uncomfortable, the walls were bare, and everything just looked like no one cared about it. Our server was the absolute worst part of the entire night. She was slow and when we asked what was in the twenty-five euro bento box she said ""I have no idea! What do you mean?""Then we asked her politely if she could find out what was in it, and she said, ""what?"" By this point I was already so annoyed. When she came back she really put the cherry on top of the sundae was telling us ""the bento box comes with salad, a miso soup, and rice of course!"" The she gave us a bad attitude when we decided not to order it. Even worse, she hardly came to check up on us, and when I asked her for the check she looked confused again. It was just a miserable dining experience. The prices were very expensive as well. The menu didn't explain exactly what you got, and it was again so old and dirty. For the food alone, this place would have gotten four stars (even with the expensive prices,) but the service was so terrible that I could almost safely say that this was one of the worst nights of my life."
4,"I've eaten at the bistro twice. Last time was last sunday which was a very busy day. The weather was hot and sun shining so the outdoor terrace was crowded. The service was slow because the staff was short due to several waiters being ill, so we got our drinks 15 minutes after we received our food. But they apologized and explained the situation. We didn't mind the tardiness. The food was also amazing and made up for it. It is also the only place I've seen that serves Nigerian Mountain tea. The day we were there they hade some musician playing on the square outside and Carls served drinks to the audience. Very nice atmosphere. Perfectly fitting for Hafencity. In the bistro they have a store where you can buy spices, tea and other things from their own brand Carls, wine from the related brand Louis C Jacob (Hotel and michelin-star restaurant C Jacob and Carls have the same owner), as well as lemonade, vineager, olive oil, cookies etc from various french brands. I LOVE the combination of bistro and store. And since the store is in the bistro it is open on Sundays which is a rarity in Hamburg.I bought Carls spices, Carls Elbe sea salt (profit goes to the elbe philharmonie foundation), avocado oil, Louis C Jacob's rosé wine (very nice btw) and Darjheeling tea. Oh and if you are there, either at the Carls bistro or the next door Carls brasserie, you HAVE to check out the ladies room. They look like they are from a old french movie from the 1920s, with upper half of the walls covered in in black and beige striped wallpapers, and the lower half in beige tiles, and the fllor in black and white tiles. And cool square shaped toilet seats to match. They also have a nice dressing room outside the toilets. Next time I'm in Hamburg I will visit the brasserie."
4,"Nicely situated along the Elbe and the sous-chef that started this dining fusion concept used to be associated with the Landhaus Scherrer from what I was told. It is a bit out of the way to reach if you do not have a car, as the nearest public transportation by train is Landungsbrücken or taking a bus (112) along the Elbechausse. Once you arrive, the place is neatly organized, however due to lack of space and popularity of its infamous reputation, they pack tables in a bit too tightly. It is one great room with everyone lined up so closely, I can hear my neighbor chewing their salad.  Not a good seating situation for the claustrophobic, however, the food is so nice and service impeccably attentive, that one easily forgives the spacial limitations and enjoys the intimacy of the surroundings instead. All sushi is delicious, I mean, really. If you love sushi, order by favorite ingredients, as we all have our personal favorites that we crave consistently, but if feeling more adventurous, one can do no wrong here. Fresh, tasty, exotic rolls, that satisfy.You pay for sushi quality, so expect a reasonably pricey bill at the end of your meal, particularly if you are the type to go Rambo like myself and order with big eyes and a curious stomach :)  When sushi is of a higher caliber of quality, I often opt for sashimi, so not to waste my low carb diet on rice and extra sauces when the fish alone tastes marvelous enough with a spot of low sodium soy sauce and swipe of wasabi for good measure, topped with a ginger garnish! Sehr Lecker...If with a friend, do some fresh light appetizers, order a variety platter, and a bottle of Riesling, followed up with a warm chocolate dessert if available.  You will leave feeling like you just fell from sushi heaven.  I normally take in this experience with a friend, when we feel like having a nice, quiet, special sushi dinner away from the Mitte madness.My only complaint? I wish it was not so far from my home and off of a main public transportation route, but tis the price one pays for the views that can only be witnessed next to the Elbe River."
4,Simply stated- the best service in Hamburg. Always a friendly and accommodating staff and the food is consistently very good.
4,Excellent! Once of the best Thai meals I've had outside of Thailand.
2,"The grilled fish and meat is really good and would warrant the fourth star. Unfortunately sides are a little bland, and sauces clearly contain ready-made convenience ingredients. Atmosphere is ok, and they keep distributing glasses of Raki..."
3,"My friend and I had a lovely lunch here today after spending about two hours enjoying the Miniatur Wunderland not far away.Good service (what? yes!) from an attentive waitress who helped with our orders, brought us beer and food and was amazingly swift with the check. She was even able to split it across two credit cards. Yes!I've been craving currywurst for some reason and so that's what I had for lunch. A nice sized sausage with a spicy sauce and a big serving of fries. It perfectly satisfied my craving. And the delicious lager with it? Ja!Free wifi worked well as we tried to work out what we'd do next in this city.[Review 12056 overall, 1839 of 2019.]"
3,"Great, real Austrian place. You come for the Schnitzel and you return for the Schnitzel. Authentic menu with everything you'd expect from the Austrians from Nocken via Zwetschge to Kaiserschmarn. Obviously consistently good since the place still fills up in the evenings. Make sure to reserve. The smaller schnitzel is sufficient but if you're really hungry, go for the large one. It will satisfy. Service was also super nice and you could see they all care. We went home happy and will be back, sooner than later. My favorite schnitzel is still at Casse Croute in Hamburg but this place is a very close second and literally just a smidgen less good."
3,"Durch Qype sind wir auf das Restaurant aufmerksam geworden. Unscheinbar von außen; klein und gemütlich innen. Ich hatte einen Tisch für eine kleine Geburtsfeier gebucht. Schöner, dekorierter Tisch in der Ecke mit Überblick. Herzliches Willkommen durch Frau Teichmann. Das Geburtstagskind wurde mit einem kleinen Küchlein mit Kerze überrascht. Wir bestellten Pannfisch, einfach köstlich. Der empfohlene Wein ein Genuss. Die Nachspeise  eigentlich war kein Platz mehr  war der krönende Abschluß. Das Sagners ist ein Spitzenrestaurant. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Trip nach Hamburg wieder vorbeikommen. Wir wünschen Herrn und Frau Teichmann viele Gäste und weiterhin viel Kreativität."
4,"A MUST for a visitor in Hamburg ist the City-Hall. Build in the end of the 19th century it was to be a monument against NOBILITY. Hamburg was to become ONE with the German EMPIRE under the rule of emperor Wilhelm II.Almost all other parts of Germany were Kingdoms, ruled by Kings, Dukes and Earls. Hamburg was a free city, ruled by merchands. It was incredibly important for Hamburg's political society to make a statement. HAMBURG is level with NOBILITY. The city build a townhall to conquer all questions. 11 years of building time, countless people, who took influence. A decade, in which art was turned upside-down. ... Lost documentary, almost 700 rooms... This building is sooo incredible, so unknown yet ... a MUST-SEE."
2,"This used to be a five star place. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have taken a dive. Service is fast and it's so busy you have to fight for a seat. This hasn't changed. These are the reasons I'm disappointed: 1.) My favorite items, the salad and the sandwhich with thinly sliced filet has been discontinued. Only variations of burger patty are available now. 2.) They ran out of carbonation for their fountain drinks. They offered a bottle of Fritz Cola instead, but didn't have any in diet. 3.) I ordered a salad with balsamic vinegar and got one with French dressing. 4.) They remade my salad and it tasted like both balsamic and French dressing combined. Was the mixing bowl clean? 5.) It used to be that their salads used the finer parts of the leaves. My salad tonight consisted of at least 50% white parts, the tough and tasteless sections of the lettuce leaf near the stem. I ended up eating less than half of my salad. Even my husband who happily gobbles up my plate and his took just a few bites and gave up. Honestly, with the filet strips no longer on the menu, I have no reason to return to this Jim Block or any other Jim Block."
4,Sten is extremely friendly! Such a quaint cute little cafe.  The pastries are delicious you must try them all (:
3,"So good I had to go twice in less than 24 hours! If you thought culinary creativity was limited to Heston Blumthing and his Fat Duck, think again. Had I had the good grace in school to bother studying German, rather than bunking off to mess around in the park, I might have understood what I was ordering. Luckily for me I didn't. Lucky, because I ended up randomly picking something from the menu, and it turned out to be a chocolate covered enchilada. Now normally I'd scoff at anyone eating chocolate covered savoury food, and probably top it off with some Rab C Nesbitt impressions, but this was one kick ass enchilada."
2,"If you need to satisfy your greasy Chinese food cravings this is def the place to come to. Over priced Chinese food with an ambiance that makes you feel like you in the movie rush hour. The food is just ok, fairly fresh. Unfortunately I ordered from the English menu which didn't really explain the dishes very well so ask your server to clarify!"
0,"It was our last day in our vacation in Germany. We went here today past 4pm and hoping to have an early dinner. There was only 2 guests when we entered and the restaurant was not busy at all. When we came in, we checked the menu and asked if they have an english version. The caucasian guy who approached us kept talking in German. My bf asked for the buffet price and the waiter got more irritated. Then suddenly he just walked away from us!!! This is so far the most arrogant and most rude customer service we've ever encountered! Worst is when we are leaving the restaurant, the other employee gave us the middle finger!!! We were like, 'what is wrong with these people'?!!!I used to be a waitress and we treat people with respect. We were completely appalled with this experience!!!"
4,"Great Greek restaurant. We walked into the restaurant at midnight on a Saturday night. It was still opened until 2am. The waiter was not so nice but I can understand given the time. For only 12€50, I've got a big plate with pork Souflaki, tzatziki, gyros and fries. They even offered us a salad in entrance. The flavors reminded me when I was in Greece few years ago, so good job!"
4,"Best Greek food in the city!Run by the real Greeks who put their hearts not only to the food but also to welcoming the guests and giving the best experience possible! I have visited a few Greek restaurants in HH and this is far the best one. The meat is fresh, well seasoned and never dry. Gyros and calamaris are my personal favorites. The portions are large and the prices are low :)"
3,"Delightful small Italian restaurant in an unremarkable spot near Rodingsmarkt UBahn. High tables with red and white checkered tablecloths lead off the open kitchen, giving it a very ""homecooking"" sort of feel. I can only comment on the pizzas so far - but they were superb. Perfect thin crispy bases with very generous toppings. And the service is delightful - we were definitely being ""mothered"" by the wonderful lady of the house."
4,"This doesn't look like much but boy is the food good. True authentic north Indian cuisine. Even had a kingfisher with my meal. You get a large portion of food for a very good price; the thalis which includes rice, yoghurt, some lentil sauce and your curry of choice cost between 6 and 8 euros which is really good.They also have lots of deserts on sales each costing 0.8. We each got a couple different ones and tried them. Unfortunately I don't remember most names but I wasn't a fan of the milk cake. Worth noting the staff speak both English and German."
2,i guess i should try it again.. first time wasn't really that good. not like something was bad  that borshch is just not for my taste
4,"I already passed this bar many times on my way to the schanze. Never went in because of the tight packed crowd.Until last friday, I arrived early, lucky to find seats on the bar! Perfect setting, when you feel like drinking!Around 10oclock it was getting more crowded, which only improved the chill, social atmosphere.A goodlooking dj played funky background sounds, although, unfortunately, this is not the place to dance your night away...Perfect for starting off though!The caiprinhias were amazing, so was the service (only woman...?!), and after some tequilla gold shots I was feeling like I wasnt able to leave this place ever again! Or else...come back for sure! Prices are reasonable, luckily! Another reason I should go back...There was supposed to be an aquarium in the middle of the room (cool!!), I did had some thoughts..but yeah, to be sure, definitely have to come back to have a closer look!"
4,"Woohoo!!! Simply amazing...I decided to enjoy my dinner here with my parents, we had an amazing food experience!Everything is perfect! You start with a shrimps flambè, then two courses of fish/meat and dessert. Everything is so well presented and the cozy atmosphere let you enjoy a really good dinner!Reservation is suggested since the restaurant is quite small inside."
4,"to echo another reviewer: hands down the best falafel in hamburg.it's also, miraculously, the cheapest: €2,50 for a basic wrap, €,50 for each additional ingredient, meaning you can get an enormous, overstuffed, insanely delicious falafel for the same price as a shitty, flavorless one at every other shop. i know which one i'd choose!"
4,"Epitome of Hamburger Berg. It has it all: coolness, attitude, tunes, drinks Music is great. It can get very crowded on the dancefloor. But that's exactly what I like about it: people come to have fun and shake their bones to their favourite beats. It's as simple as that. My favourite @Reeperbahn"
4,"After a long search on Yelp, decided to try this place. I have to say, I am not disappointed. Nice small and quiet, situated in the Altstadt, not far from the Hbf, on a side street.As you step in, the place is really modern and friendly. The menu is simple and not over complicated with fancy names for simple stuff.The burgers are medium seized and very tasty. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients like tomato and salad. The waiting time for the burger is above average fast.If you are looking for a fast escape for dinner, this is the place.I would recommend the  burger menu, with pommes and drinks. Its really good deal."
3,"Ate dinner at Xeom based on the Yelp reviews. We showed up to a packed house and had about a 10 minute wait before being seated. We shared a table with two other diners in a corner of the restaurant. (Thankfully I'd read that sharing tables is common...)I ordered pho while my husband had curry chicken, and we shared spring rolls. The spring roll wrapper was a lot thicker than I am used to - I wonder if they're not available in Hamburg. The curry chicken was ok, but it had a strange smooth consistency like gravy, with big chunks of carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes. I was surprised to see tomatoes in the curry, but we ate them anyway. The pho was OK, definitely smaller portions than in the U.S., and less cuts of meat. I was given a lemon wedge whereas I'm used to receiving a lime wedge. There was also no mint leaves, beansprouts, or are jalapeño peppers... The table offered a bottle of sriracha, but no hoisin sauce. I was still hungry after dinner.Overall dinner was OK, but just not what I'm used to from the plethora of Vietnamese restaurants at home. Xeom is cash only."
3,One of my fav coffee places in hamburg. Good quality beans and coffee tastes good...you can buy their home rosted beans too. Service is good and prices are affordable! Check this place out- fav ones are cappuccino and flat white ;)
4,"I went there for dinner and my expectations were not only met, but highly exceeded. Locally bought food, cooked by an extremely friendly staff. I had homemade pasta, with lentils and sausage, and some salad. Everything was fresh. I highly recommend this place!"
0,"They are not interested in customers with kids. If your pram does not fit in the half opened door, they just don't care even if there would be plenty of space inside."
4,"Really great food - excellent selection, friendly service, if a little slow. Really big portions. The grill for two people was especially nice."
4,"Der beste Grieche in ganz Hamburg.Wer hier nicht bei Top-Essen satt wird,ist selber Schuld!"
3,"After university my friend and I used to come here for cup of coffee and snack. We really loved sitting outside on their cute small table and chairs on the vibrant and artsy street in Sternschanze.Nice and welcoming decor, attentive staff and delicious food.Definitely come here if you want to have a nice ambiance with friends."
3,"We stumbled upon Thämers during a frigid, windy Sunday, and it served as an excellent port during the storm. Though we didn't try the food, the Latte Machiatto and Pharisäer were just what the doctor ordered. Looking forward to trying out the terrace when the weather improves and upgrading to 5 stars! Kann es fast empfehlen!"
4,"I know it is going to sound strange to read this, but I gotta let it out. How niiiice the people here are. My best friend wanted to book a table yesterday and one of the staff members from the kitchen just showed us a piece of paper which basically said: Please take NO more bookings for tonight! He smiled at us and showed it to us, but asked us to leave our number just in case there might be an open spot later. My friend received a call, called back and this friendly woman just said: Hello Alex! Yeah..now you are surprised, right?! And he was. Unfortunately they didin't have a free table for the time he wanted, but he said being declined with such a nice explanation will make him come back pretty soon and this time he will book days in advanced. This seems to be the new/old hidden hot spot in the hood.I am exited to get to know it and then write another feedback."
4,"Awesome German food! A few nice Schnitzels to choose from (incl. a beer crust and a pretzel-breaded Schnitzel), as well as other pasta and meat specialties. Nice high-class brewery atmosphere  speaking of which, their beer is excellent. Fair prices as well, and a very central location. Friendly waitstaff. One of my favorite German food places in Hamburg!"
3,"Yes it's true: it's a beach club in the middle of town. Complete with sand, chairs, ping pong and more (but no volleyball, sigh...)Yelp turned me in to this and because I needed a chill vibe and uncomplicated food st reasonable prices I came here. No Chardonnay but I made do with a Pinot Grigio. The next stand over o ordered the Curry Wurst and Pommes with Mayo. Nice large portion of all and the Curry Wurst was tasty but I'm not used to the sweet-sour glaze it swam in. One drawback...no cards. Cash only and you don't know that before you order. I guess I really should get used to asking that ahead of time because I keep running into that. But there are places you just expect to be able to use a card and a restaurant is just one of those. I can see how this place would be packed on a summer afternoon or weekend. Too fun!"
3,"When planning your trip to Hamburg, don't count on going to any museums on Monday, as they are all closed.  Except for this little culinary nugget :)We actually ended up here by default, after realizing everything else would be closed for the day.  We also found out that we would have to join in on the German tour, as they only do English speaking tours on the weekends.  Fortunately, this all changed when the tour guide was having someone shadow her because it was her first day.  This meant the seasoned tour guide could stay back and explain everything in English.Overall, this museum is really cool.  They walk you through the ways in which chocolate is made, from selecting the cocoa bean, to roasting, to processing, to the final product.  And they let you try the cocoa all along the way! It is also equipped with an opportunity to make your own chocolate bar, which is very cool.  This tour can  take up to 2 hours, so make sure you plan accordingly.  You definitely don't want to cut it short.Fun museum and would definitely recommend to those looking for something a bit different in Hamburg."
0,Service is very slow. Took us over two hours since we sat down to finally get our food. Unbelievable. This is on a Tuesday night. Food was mediocre at best. Will not return.
4,"Best Arabic restaurant in town. Cheap and super tasteful! The service is awesome as well, such nice and friendly waiters!"
4,Very nice place to look at from both the inside & the outside. The building is clean and well maintained! Don't forget to sign the guest book!!
3,"I went here for lunch with a coworker today and quite enjoyed it. Quick advice: try to come at an off-time! This restaurant is tiny, tiny, tiny--maybe only 3-4 small tables. We ate relatively late at 1 p.m., and we still had people eagerly waiting for our table.We both ordered the same thing--the grilled fish plate and a cherry soda. I don't know if anyone speaks English here because we ordered in German, but it would have been easy enough to just point at the menu if you can't speak any. We had our food in about 10 minutes  or so. The grill-plates were amply filled with a few different types of fish and a tasty salad. There was quite a bit of tartar sauce on the side, but I didn't use most of it because the fish was that good.Also, even though the restaurant is quite small, or maybe exactly because it is so small, I liked the ambience of this place. The stools were all well-worn, the tables tiny, and the street outside old and cobbled. Many of the restaurants in the neighborhood are soulless cafes and kiosks, so enjoy something a bit nicer here--though still not too expensive."
3,"been here several times, usually pretty early in the afternoon. it's a small place, & there are only ever 1 or 2 people working at a time. thus the service can be pretty slow; however, i find that the croques are worth it. i always get the antipasti croque, it's amazing, and also big enough that i take half home & get a second meal out of it (your mileage may vary). try dining in the quiet little garden out back if the weather's nice."
3,"This is sort of place I would come to a lot if I wasn't married with two children and had a highly stressful job that took up all of my time. Or in my 40s. So, the format is like being in your coolest friends apartment, complete with sofas, pool table, cracking tunes, and an open basement with dancefloor and various industrial remnants of it's time as a DildoFabrik (yes it's an easy translation) . It's also one street from the main Reeperbahn, not hugely far from St Pauli / Millerntor / all the fun of the fair. So perfectly located for good times and a friendly bohemian crowd. Very popular with the Qype Kids, and the venue for our excellent 2011 Xmas (Q)iez party."
3,"Sundays around here don't have much too offer. Being first to wait had its merits though, because this place got packed fast.I had a L'envie with a cafe au lait. The crepe was ridiculously tasty. The cheese and ham tucked into the crepe with spinach and onion jam for toppings, then top it off with a dip into the egg yolk. Savory and delicious!The owner is French, but the staff regularly converse in German. English menus are a bit outdated in pricing at this point. Seating on two levels, bathrooms are on the second level too. Sadly if they catch on that you're from the US, they will push for an American sized tip."
3,"Take the general cool chic of the Schanze, pick a great location in one of the old slaughterhouses and then add in a TV chef and a minimalist menu. That's Bullerei. The prices are surprisingly cheap - about EUR8 for a meal + Astra beer. The food isn't particularly amazing though. It seems to be basic stuff, done better than average. I had chicken drumsticks with a pasta salad and Astra for EUR7.50. It was decent without being great. It's generally really busy, so although they have huge tables that would be great for groups, you might find it hard to get seating for more than 2-4 people. I'll probably try it again sometime.."
3,"I like this place a lot. We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon not knowing quite what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised. It seems new, the staff is nice, and the food is good.The floor plan is a bit odd... the entrance is alongside the pizza kitchen, with a huge countertop and a giant red oven. Towards the back up a short flight of stairs is the dining room, which probably seats about 40 or 50 people, and is decorated in a minimalist, trendy way with plants growing in gutters along a side wall.The menu is mostly pizza, along with a few appetizers and a few salad options. They also have a pizza-based dessert which is chocolate raviolis made with pizza dough. We didn't try dessert on our first visit, but it will probably happen at some point. There is also a surprisingly long drink menu; everything from coffee and tea to beer and wine, and cocktails to boot.I ordered the special pizza, which was fennel sausage, roasted red pepper strips, and shaved parmesan. My wife had the portobello pizza, which has ricotta instead of tomato sauce, and is topped with mushrooms and truffle oil. Both were delicious and filling. There's a lot of advertising around to tell you this, but these are meant to be Neapolitan-style pizzas which are baked in a 400C oven for 90 seconds. As a result, the pizzas come out mostly cooked, but still a little watery, and the crust never gets terribly crisp. (I don't mind, but apparently this bothers other Yelpers.)In the ""How is it for kids?"" department, our daughter was greeted with a coloring book and a jar full of colored pencils, and when it came time to ordering, we were able to get her a smaller kinder-pizza withOUT (this is the most important part) any green seasoning (oregano) whatsoever. They are very accommodating of picky kids.I liked the vibe a lot, and the food was good. I'll definitely be back."
4,"Hands down the best price to food ratio in the city. All burgers are freshly made to order and they will make whatever crazy burger combinations you throw at them. It's possible to get a burger, fries, and a beer for under 10€. This is a great place to go if you looking to eat a good burger on a budget."
4,"It's bigger inside than it seems, many white tables, and fully booked at dinnertime. Don't come without a reservation.Food and service are superb here; a confidently limited set of dishes, creative food without going overboard, generous portions, and not too expensive for what you get either. Everything feels pleasantly un-rushed, making this a nice place to dine out with a little time.Same goes for the wines: a very tasteful selection, and all sized and priced so you'll be happy to order more.Nailed it, don't change the concept! :)"
2,"I went with a friend of mine that I haven't seen for years to have a dinner there, he told me that the pizza there is just out of this world. The place was a bit crowded on Friday evening, it took around 5 minuets to get seated which was fine. The waitress came and took our order and she was really nice. We ordered shrimps with garlic pizza which tasted fantastic. I was actually shocked by how big the pizza is over there.The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because my friend was drinking from a glass that was broken and he got his lips cut, and when they replaced the glass, the new glass was also broken. I believe they have to pay some extra attention to that.Overall, the restaurant is a one that I would recommend, but unfortunately we had this problem over there."
4,Tasty pho.  it's quite good.  warm atmosphere inside. place gets full during lunch rush. we walked in and got last table at 11:30 am on a weekday so get there early.  I will definitely come again to try other menu items.
4,"Amazing place, details are unbelievable. What amount of work for completing it."
2,"We went here twice in one day!  For dinner was actually because a handful of other restaurants seemed to be closed and we wanted a menu with a variety of menu options.  Earlier that Monday the whole team went here for lunch.  My german team told us that the pizzas here are huge, so one of my collagues and I shared a caprese pizza (they gave us both one half).  I enjoyed the fresh table bread they provided.  Service during the day was better than when we went at night.  The caprese pizza was alright, but had just one small little ball of mozzarella and one teeny basil leaf on each slice.  I would have expected more.  As others have mentioned, the toppings are on the sparse side.  I also ordered a side salad, so I only ended up eating one slice of pizza and taking the rest to go.When we came back for dinner later that night, they were very busy but we were able to get a table by the door.  I had ordered a tomato shrimp gnocchi dish, the girls had ordered an artichoke cream soup and a special crawfish pasta.  We all ended up sharing even though my main dish was the gnocchi.  The portions here are huge again, even more so with the pasta.  The gnocchi were very pillowy and filling.  I actually enjoyed the light cream sauce crawfish pasta more, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish.  And the artichoke cream soup was refreshing.  Again, since they were so busy, we had to keep asking for several things.  But it's honestly not a bad option for a cheap Italian meal.  Dishes top around 12-13 Euro."
4,A great place for fish and seafood. Always something good on the menu with regular specials. Reasonably priced and friendly staff too.
4,"Chocolate Museum Tour is normally in German but the entire group spoke English so thank goodness the guide was able to do it in English. Made our own chocolate bars, learned about the fascinating history and process of how cocoa is produced and eventually made into the sweet sweet chocolate we know today. Worth the money! Loved learning about all of the history and procedures/stages of making chocolate."
4,THE BEST SAUSAGES IN TOWN !! A MUST for visitors and locals. Ideally located for shopping and a quick snack
3,"American tourist here. Ate here on a Sunday with wife and daughter. Strongly recommend making a reservation for any night, but particularly weekend nights. We were seated quickly upstairs as requested. The waiter took our order quickly, but it was about and hour before the food came. The waiter was great but clearly the kitchen isn't big enough for a full restaurant. Please note, they don't have an English menu, but if you know crepes, you can make do with the French. They do speak enough English to be helpful.The crepes were great. Unusual mix of ingredient options which was very similar to a creperie I tried in France once. Large selection. I had one with egg, mushrooms, ham, spinach. My daughter had a ham and cheese. Perfectly cooked and flavored. We split a couple of dessert crepes which were also delicious but also took a 1/2 hour to get. Definitely a worthy place, but plan carefully if you are with kids."
4,"The best cup of coffee I had in Germany, and possibly ever, came from this lovely little cramped coffee house we spotted on our way back to the train after a full day of exploring Hamburg. We were desperate to acclimate to the time change and coffee sounded like just the ticket, so we stopped in and ordered a highly caffeinated round of deliciousness. I ordered a flat white and a chocolate torte (I actually received a pomegranate cheesecake type treat, which is likely 20% due to the staggeringly loud atmosphere and 80% due to me not speaking a single word of German!), but I still enjoyed it. The coffee was the crowning glory of our stop - rich, strong, perfectly poured and capped with a layer of foam decorated with a pretty little heart. I wanted to try to get back here before heading back to the states, but it was just far enough away from where we were staying that I couldn't swing it. I will dream about that delightful flat white, however, and if I ever return, this will be at the top of my list."
2,An OK version of an Aussie bar where you can drink VB and Fosters. The food is quite good: wings are the house speciality in many many sauces  not typically Australian but good. A bit out of town but walkable from Dammtor station.
4,"Not the cheapest lunch option around at about EUR9, but certainly a unique one. The various meals that I saw around our table all had a thin, almost soupy sauce, on rice & vegetables with either tofu or meat all contained in rather elegant bowls. I also ordered a green tea, which was a great decision! My colleague, Liron (see her review), had some issues with it being too spicy, but my dish was fine. It is worth noting that they don't serve anything without spice though"
3,"Better than the average British indie night. Ended up here, en route to the Schanze, and stayed all night. EUR4 entry and EUR2.50 for a bottle of lager is pretty reasonable for a Saturday and the music was the same clichéd bands you'd hear in the UK: Oasis, Blur, Joy Division but with more variety- eg instead of playing Love will tear us apart they played Disorder. Not recommended if you want something quentissentially Hamburg, but a good safe bet."
1,"Unimpressive and a bit worse than the other locations. Had lunch here today and wasn't impressed whatsoever with the self-service conecept, the tight seating, the slowness of the service and the bland food. Worst was the food. Flavor-less dishes prepared in foo-chain style. I am getting kind of fed up with these concepts which initially work, and then are copied around town ad-infinitum. I wish the main focus remained on quality, but instead they tried to multiply this for profit. Oh well, better luck next time!"
2,Not sure how this place got such high ratings. We made reservations since we heard it was highly recommended to reserve a table. My husband is a vegetarian and his co-workers told him about the restaurant. Just about everything on the menu had either mushrooms (which I dislike) or eggplant (not a big fan). We ordered a Tassajara Ice Tea which was bitter and not to our liking but we forced it down. I wished I had gotten juice or the Mango Lassi. My husband ordered the mix salad and I ordered the soup. The soup arrive hot and in a rather big bowl for German standards. I was hopeful the Eggplant Curry would be spicy and flavoured but it left a lot to be desired. It was bland and the only bright spot was that it arrived hot. The side salad and rice was tasty but nothing to get excited about. We decided to pass on desserts although they did look rather tasty.
4,"First time trying pakistan's food and i felt in love directly. The food to my sense is like indian's food, full of spicy but soooo delicious. The best thing is that there is a place where we can sit directly there, no need a chair. So cozy so relax, makes us almost felt to sleep :DThe food like i said total delicious, especially very recommended the mango lassi. That is like tasting heaven's drink, until after that we seemed hypnotized with the taste left behind on our mouth,"
4,"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the Schanze, definitely my favourite Greek restaurant. I remember coming here a while ago on a Friday night after work with a couple of colleagues and they told me straight away that I should have Gyros mit Pommes because it was delicious andit didn't fail the expectations! After that first time I've been here a few times more, never bothered to try something else  apart from Gyros mit Pilsen & Pommes, which wasn't as awesome as I expected but still really tasty.Prices are definitely ok, you must pay cash which is not unusual in Hamburg, and the service is the best I've experienced and I remember of. They're always super bizy but somehow they always manage not to screw up and to bring you food after a reasonable waiting time, so props. Last couple of things worth mentioning: 1) they've got a couple of TVs inside, so you can watch Bundesliga or Champions League games and 2) if you pay at the counter you're usually asked if you want some Ouzowhich comes for free! :-) I'll come back here over and over again."
2,"Wildfleisch burgers! Too bad I did not know what wildfleisch was until I got home from my dinner at Edelsatt and decided to look it up. I definitely like the all around organic offerings at Edelsatt as well as the idea of a venison burger patty. I ordered the Edelsatt burger. This was a hamburger that called for the use of forks and knives. Not knowing it was venison, the patty did strike me as odd. It appeared to me that the venison meat was not grounded well enough, and then was smashed together into a burger patty; it was kind of like a piece of steak that fell apart to easily when you bit into it. It's hard to describe. There wasn't enough salt on the patty either for my taste. The bio bread was difficult to cut or even bite into. My burger devolved into a messy heap. I did like the mayo and the grilled onions. Others have complained about the fries, but I rather liked them a tad soft. I washed it all down with a rhubarb fritz cola. It was 9€ for the burger plus 3.50€ for the added fries and drink. The restaurant itself is a cool spot. I dig the decor. The food came out fast and the staff was very friendly. The hubby and I decided, possibly in unison, that we would likely not order the burgers again. That is, unless they make it feel more like an actual burger patty. I would like to try the currywurst, so I'll be coming back at least for that."
4,"Loved this place! Definitely the best Indian food we've found in Hamburg. I think you can't go wrong with ordering any dish here. Loved the naan and chicken curry. Definitely not a pretty restaurant and service here is not anything to write home about, so the food here is the star!I wish Germany had more of these types of restaurant options, where you order at the counter and pick up your food when it's ready. Easy, quick and cheap! Love it!"
3,"If you are looking for a good after hours spot on a Thursday night in Germany check this place out.  It's a nice bar for the regular fruity bar drinks and also a good regular one.  Keep in mind you might have to wait a little at the bar; however, being from Miami I am kind of used to that in the clubs.  The music was good more hip hop if that what you are into.  I didn't eat there so I cant speak for the food, but I think it's best to go and eat there early if you are hungry.  Otherwise you will be standing up.  I would go again when I'm in town."
3,"If you see the locals eating here, you know that it's gotta be good...but it was soooooo good. This place was bustling nearly 24/7 for a reason. We passed this place several times of day over the two days we were in town as we were staying nearby and every time the tables were filled...12PM, 6PM or 2AM...this place was putting down excellent food. We came here for some late night goodies after a night out and then more importantly for dinner one evening and I was thoroughly impressed. The ezme and homemade pita bread (more of a cross between pizza crush and naan) as a starter on the table was TOO DIE FOR! Such a great first impression. Then the rest of the food that followed was just a pile of flavor explosions! The meats are incredibly well season and prepared. The vegetables are fresh and all the sauces are lick the platter clean good. Highly recommend this as a stop while you're in Hamburg...at ANY time of day. Only complaint...the place was HOT! Really warm and wish they would use the A/C a little more liberally."
1,"Balutschistan was another destination on the quest to find a half-decent curry in Germany. Sadly, I came out wishing I'd asked them to ignore the menu and just cook something they'd eat, not a pale watered-down German version, but I didn't, and that's what I got. The service was unfriendly, it was quite pricey, and the food arrived disturbingly quickly. It's not cooked to order! I wouldn't really rush to get back in here."
4,"To be honest, despite thinking I was sober when I arrived at this bar, looking back I was not! But what I remember is that it was really nice atmosphere, wicked decor, good drinks prices and even though we planned to move on to another bar we did not so must have been good! I also have a vague memory of spinning some sort of music wheel on the dance floor and dancing on my own. So yes, I recommend it and will definitely be going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
4,"My new favorite Falafel place!!! I love it when i get so many freebiesi ordered the (number 23) Chicken Shawarma, and while i was waiting for my order, i got a Date-cookie, then a sesame cookie.. and then i got a free falafel! The owner is from Iraq and quite friendlyit did help that we have the same mother language, but stillHe had also offered the previous 2 customers the sesame cookie although they couldnt speak a word of arabic (excluding falafel and hummus). The chicken shawarma tasted really good... i eat everything if its immersed in hummus... A sandwich costs between 3EUR50 and 4EUR pretty fair for the size of the sandwich ur getting..."
3,"Great restaurant off the beaten path, in Eimsbüttel, one of Hamburg's liveliest and most interesting neighborhoods. The name is unusual, referring to swimming lessons, and there is a bowling alley in the basement. It's this quirky personality that makes the Freischwimmer charming. The decor is a sort of simple chic that reflects Hanseatic understatement. The food is interesting and well executed - a combination of German and Mediterranean. The wine list short but quality. And the service is knowledgeable, attentive and friendly."
2,"Slightly cozier than sister locale mi-chii with all its concrete, the original O-ren Ishii is still geared toward fast eating prior to dinner hours, with five changing dishes every day, all around 10-13€. Benches and stools are simple, hard, with very few seats even boasting as much as a backrest.Food started more pleasantly, with a delicious spicy home-made lemonade. This was followed by absolutely brilliant spring rolls; airy, crispy, just perfection on a bed of fresh herbs. Do not miss out on those if you eat here!Unfortunately, my main course let me down again: I got a Vietnamese-style rice bowl with a generous helping of chicken, but they somehow managed to make a ginger-chili sauce dull and boring. A spicy, bland dish, and no other sauces or dressings available to at least dilettante things up...As much as I loved the starter course: the bland main, as well as the uncomfortable seating would not entice me back."
2,"Interior looks nice, bartender were nice, atmosphere was nice, all went well but you can smoke inside. We gave it a try anyway, but just this one time."
2,"As expected, your typical Hofbrau house with the traditional hall seating setup! Traditional food as well with 1L beers at reasonable (but slightly pricier) prices. Recommend stopping by for the experience! Can also make reservations. They sell the steins and mugs as well."
3,"On a business trip in town and saw this place.  Walked in on a Tuesday night and seated without a reservation.  We all ordered Ribeye Steaks.  All 3 were cooked to perfection.  One person had the Pepper Sauce and sad is was spicy (says scharf on the menu), and loved it.  Very clean restaurant, and service was great.  Steaks were excellent for the price.  Would definitley come back again."
0,We went there at 10:50pm yesterday to have a glass of wine. The waiter never cleaned the table nor did he ask us what we would like to have. The restaurant was about 70% full. This non-service is horrible. Never go there !
4,"Monday night at 8:30 is free jazz auf dem Feuerschiff! A short and scenic walk along the harbor then, ""all aboard!"" The boat stays stationary so you don't have to worry about not wanting to stay all evening or in case you are prone to getting seasick. You are free to come and go as you please. Jazz music is played below deck where there is also a bar with some seating and a number of tables for dining as well. Fun atmosphere, good times, and good music."
3,"Really good burger in Europe. Like the establishment and the touchscreen menu at the table. Quick efficient service, excellent tasting burger. You order it medium and u get it medium."
0,"Do not bother, we waited upwards of 30 minutes between servers and the meat was just not that great.  Big disappointment both in food quality and service, especially at the price..."
3,"I'm an Asian. Their Chinese food of course is a bit German style for me but for German it is the best what they can have with a very very good price, especially with the growing kids, they can have as much as they can. After the extension of the restaurant, the sittings area even bigger and more comfortable, and also they provide some outside sittings too."
4,"A very nice hidden cafe;  if you're somewhere around you should definitely visit and sit outside! (As long as the weather allows that is). I enjoy their quiche and breakfast menus, their friendly staff  and good service"
4,"I felt like I am in a good restaurant somewhere in South-East Asia, a real thing. Very peacefull, calm, full of orchids  very differnt from any Asian restaurants in Hamburg. My partner and me tried two different menus and all dishes were tasty, except of curries  too salty.Not as pricy as I thought. Would definitely come back again."
1,Disappointing burger. The restaurant hat a really good rating but I wouldn't consider like a restaurant. It seems to be more like McDonald's.The burgers are okay but I would not come back here.
3,"I've loved eating at Jim Block ever since I came to Hamburg and was excited to hear that they'd be opening a restaurant closer to the inner city and my workplace. Foolishly, I tried going there for lunch a few days ago and it was simply impossible - the line to order was so long that it extended beyond and out the front door. When I did finally manage to find a day which wasn't completely packed (Saturday night, surprisingly), I ordered a veggie burger and was somewhat disappointed. See, when I think of veggie burger, I think of a vegetable-based patty inside a bun. Jim Block's idea of a veggie burger is to throw a handful of mushrooms inside the bun and call it a burger, which we all know is blasphemy. One star off the rating for this obvious abomination. Besides this issue, Jim Block remains one of the best places in town to get a burger - it's local, fresh, affordable and doesn't make you feel like your arteries are clogging up while you eat."
2,"I like RehBar, the grown up more austere big brother of Aurel. Decent prices and it has a nice ambience but the place is a bit soulless. I like working there as there is free WiFi. Nice but nothing special."
4,"I went here for lunch and had the roast beef, with fried potatoes and salad (it cost 10.80€). We got to Hej Papa at around 12:30 and got the last table. If you are a large company it might make sense to reserve a table or come early. Anyways, might have been the best roast beef I have had here in Hamburg, so really good! The pasta dishes and salads looked really good too, so there's plenty to choose from."
4,"There are a lot of reviews, they all praise it. So do we. Enjoyed it, must go if you go to Hamburg. I would say it should be the reason for you to go to Hamburg, and you can also see other stuff in town.Service is top, WIFI is top, if you can arrange it go in November, January and February (as they guide told us), and during the week.Sunday it is always full and then you can have three rows in front of you. So if you can arrange it, come off-peak.Additionally book online upfront, so you don't have to wait."
3,Sorry ppl forgot to take picture.. But food was deeelish! Nom nom nom.. Service was also very beautiful. Ordered Lamm w Saffron.. Not sure the name.. Lentil soup was also very good.. Get urself the Lassi's.
4,"Wow! So good! Don't make the mistake I did when I was new in the city and eat at the bus terminal, walk about 5 mins to here and eat like a king. My favorite was Adona kebab."
2,"A slightly underwhelming experience for my birthday dinner. This restaurant is very close to my apartment and I was very much looking forward to being able to go there often.The amuse-bouche was amazing: A garlic soup (velouté) which tasted absolutely divine. The taste of garlic, while definitely present, was mild and enjoyable. I'm glad it came only in small espresso cups because it felt very rich.The appetizer (veal pâté with a gorgonzola mousse) was also very good. The gorgonzola mousse on top of arugula was really tasty. The pâté had also good taste but I wished that it was a little bit richer. It felt a little bit dry, but this is probably normal when you consider that it's not pork-based pâté. Also strange was that my course was served without bread.The main course is where the disappointment happened. Both my wife and I had the cod served with spinach and seafood cannelloni. The skin of the fish wasn't crispy and the spinach was underwhelming. But worst of all were the two seafood cannelloni. Whoever made these should not be allowed to cook pasta again, it was really tough and I ended up leaving on the plate. Same with my wife and my neighbor at a different table. Overall this dish had potential but the execution was poor.Service was incredibly slow. The three first courses arrived at a good pace, not fast but it left time for us to enjoy the food, wine and conversation. But once we received our main courses, the waiters just seemed to disappear. We waited so long that in the end we decided to bypass the dessert and head home, because we didn't want to wait any longer. In the end, 3 courses took more than 2 hours."
0,"DIRTY place! Both me and my friend found medium length human hair in our dishes, and we even had different dishes. When we told the staff, they were really cold and didn't apologize to both of us, just my friend. Also, when we were leaving, they sort of ignored us and didn't even say goodbye. Basically, they made us feel guilty for their own mistake and it felt like they just wanted us to leave asap. The little food we ate was average, and even if we hadn't found the hairs, I doubt we would have ever gone  back there. Avoid !"
4,"I wasn't entirely impressed by Mr. Kebab the first time I went, but for some reason, my second visit was the one which had me sold. The three of us ordered an ""enlarged grill Teller"" (see photos) which ended up including an insane amount of meat on a plate (it was about 30eu). How we managed to finish all of it is still somewhat of a mystery (how we managed to fit beer in afterwards is even more of a mystery), but we came out of Mr. Kebab in a blissful, beefy haze. The meat at Mr, Kebab, as I mentioned, is excellent. Well prepared and a rich menu assortment (a menu which includes many ridiculous and nonsensical bits of Engrish). The service is very friendly and the prices are extremely fair. The bathrooms are a little trippy. If this would be my only advice to you, make sure you visit the toilets before you down 3 liters of beer, and not after. You'll thank me later."
1,"A bland and overpriced chicken curry. A waste of time, money and my appetite. By Hamburg's standards it's not that bad  but it is a very low standard. Must do better Chutney and Hamburg generally."
2,This place offers a novel way of serving food with meat being carved directly onto your plate by the staff who are constantly passing your table. The meat was well cooked although the sides were average. Overall we found the experience to be unusual yet fun. I would recommend this to people visiting Hamburg.
3,"When in Sternchanze, Herr Max is one of the must-do's.Because you will want to.It's a little shop/café with homemade pastry offering a selection of freshly self-made cookies, tarts, cupcakes and cakes, each day slightly different ones. You can take it away (and buy one of their delicious marmalades of quite extravagant tastes, too)or please sit in, if you find a nice corner.Within its white and pastel tiled wall you'll find yourself in vintage furniture with grandma-style dishes and cutlery (but it's your stily granny)The girls behind the counter are lovely and make 1st class coffeewalk in hide from the rain and enjoy some cake and watch the world walk by its windows!"
4,One of my favorite cafes in the neighborhood. Dog friendly and gorgeous interior decoration and super friendly owners.
3,"I'd say the food in here isn't as good as in Frank und Frei across the street, but it's got plenty of charm to make up for it. And you just gotta love their breakfast, which comes with a glass of sparkling wine. There was a nice buzz about the place and the staff make you feel welcome. Minus for bad coffee though."
3,Enough has been written about this place. The food is great. I like the room because of the minimal styling. You can't beat the sushi in Hamburg. The location is easy to reach and parking is not a problem. My one major gripe about this place is the service. These are the most arrogant waiters and waitresses I've run acorss in Hamburg. They start to annoy you when you are making a reservation and they annoy through to the end until you leave. This really diappoints considering how good the rest is.
3,"Moraba is a nice bar in the schanze. Not particularly special, but certainly gets most things right. I guess the reason that I'm so blasé is because after you've been to one, you've sort of been to most of the bars in the area - they are all good, but not many stand out."
2,Do you want to experience bavaria in north germany? Come here then! It has litter beers and german food. I went on a friday night and it as really loud with live music. The staff is dressed up with bavarian attire so its a nice touristy attraction. The staff wasnt too friendly but they did give us english menus to help us out. Good place for beers.
3,"Huge variety of dishes (kebab, falafel)Cheap price - 4 euro for doner.Popular with locals,  not much space to sit inside. Fast service, friendly stuff.You cannot pay by card."
4,"Excellent vibe and great selection of craft biers! Visited on a mid-Saturday afternoon. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and knew their biers. The pulled pork sandwich was also huge and probably one of the largest sandwiches I've ever had. I'll definitely return!"
4,"This little place has lovely ""croques"" (sandwiches) and some quite interesting mixtures.Delicious, friendly, sometimes a bit crowded.You can sit outside in the summer."
0,"I have been to another Chinese Loving Hut in London, and this one was very disappointing. We went for lunch time, got the lunch deal (spring rolls or soup + a plate on the reduced menu for 6.90€). The tables weren't clean and we had to wait for 25 minutes before anyone came to get our order, but so far so good, I can live with that for the sake of good food for such a price! Sadly, our entries arrived (one soup and spring rolls) and they were barely warm. Our main course also looked re-heated. It wasn't hot, the texture of my sauce was as if the gelatine used to thicken had been cooled down and then re-heated, which caused it to be way too thick and glumpy - not good. The menu advertised that I would get seitan, though it really looked like a can mock-duck to me. The fried rice was tasty still, they can have that. We got our drinks halfway through the main course. Overall, it seems that depending on what you order, it's a hit or miss."
3,"The location is not suitable for finding this restaurant ""just by walking"". The interior is not something you want if you do fine dining. But the steaks and burgers are just awesome. They take the meat business very seriously. I mean VERY. Guaranteed you do not leave hungry from this place.For casual dinner with friends who like burgers and steaks, this is a must place to test. Keep in mind, that they accept cash only, no credit cards, so prepare yourself with cash when you arrive. The prices are not too high, but due to meat coming form USA, it is more expensive than normal restaurants serving meat."
3,"Really cool to see but it can be quite packed because of how touristy it is. It was very fasinating how detailed everything was and I can see how people can spend a few hours or even half of a day in here. If you're in Hamburg, it's worth a peek at."
3,The place is nice and comfortable. I eat here every day and I love the soups and the atmosphere. Lately they have a new Matcha Latte in their menu which I totally love. I'm not sure if it's just a summer special but I really hope they'll keep it for the rest of the year.
0,"I have never before in my life returned sushi to the chef, until my unfortunate encounter at Sushi Circle. I payed for an all-you-can-eat as a recommendation from a friend, and ended up having half a piece of nigiri, and asking for my money back. Up until this point, I must have eaten at about a hundred some-odd Sushi eateries - only a trickle served worse Sushi and provided a worse experience than at Sushi Circle. I have not grown up in a culture which serves sushi as a cultural thing (Read: I am not Japanese) but would like to be able to say that I have had enough experience with Sushi to be able to note when it's well made, or the product of ""Raw fish slackery"". I fear ""Sushi Circle"" falls into the latter category. To avoid rambling on in generic terms, here's what I didn't like about Sushi Circle's sushi experience: - The Rice/Vinegar ratio. The rice was tasteless, non-sticky, and the nigiri was falling apart. - The fish.With fresh fish, my teeth sink into the sushi. With this stuff, I needed to put up a fight. - The service.If I ask for nigiri without wassabi wedged between the rice and the fish, do I have to wait half an hour? - The selection. ""All you can eat"" rounds are not always known for their marvelous selection, but having 4 types of sushi on the conveyor belt is rather poor. - The seating.Sushi circle's establishment is built in such a way where you need to squirm and crawl to get out of your seat, or to allow others to pass by you. Very disappointed and will not return under any circumstances."
3,We were going to the nighttime lights show at Planten un Blomen and walked down the street to look for a nice place to eat. Found several restaurants grouped together on Messeplatz St/Grindelhof. And after looking at Menus we choose this one. Good service and food. Nice atmosphere and not too crowded. I had the sweet curry chicken dish which was amazing and my wife had lamb. They have pizzas also which was an interesting combo but they were excellent. Highly recommend for a nice meal at a reasonable price.
4,"This place is fabulous! I have been there a few times after playing sports or with a group of co-workers. Service is attentive, not fake, funny, knowledgeable. Atmosphere is Greek at heart, sometimes there are Greeks from the neighbourhood gathering and singing. Food is delicious, portions are big, but not too big. The appetisers like octopus or sardines were not drowned in oil, but just delicious. We usually order other appetisers, too and mix food and drinks....  Drinks: I always have a retsina wine, which reminds me of Greece. Happy customer"
3,"Just had a very good 回锅肉 / twice cooked pork (around 9 EUR with rice included) here. Meat was so juicy and tender however, it was a little too saucy from what I've normally had in China. Food comes quickly, the staff is very nice and speak mandarin! Would def like to come back!"
3,"After experiencing Zoe Bar I just had to try out this place. It's a very different atmosphere. The general theme of dark has been maintained. Black floors, black walls, minimalistic lighting. The sofa's are incredibly comfortable and perfect place to chill and chat and watch whats going on from Neuer Pferdmarkt. The sofa's seemed pretty new and in comparison to the disheveled ones in Zoe Bar there was the definite trendy atmosphere present. Service was good although I was a little dissapointed that there was either various Astra's or Carlsberg. The music bothered me a little here. They had a wide range but all played quietly. When they started playing Alternative or trance stuff then that sounded plain strange when it was so quiet. I was there on a Friday night and was surprised how quiet it was inside. There was a lot of action over at Zoe 2 outside. And I had the impression people were coming over and getting there beers and going back over to Zoe 2. I will have to sample this place once more I think. Conclusion: A good bar in a good location. Minus one star for the music weirdness :)"
3,"I went on an English Hamburg Dungeon tour with my friend and it was really fun! It was informative and easy to understand, though I will admit that more of the focus is on the effects and experience. My friend got a little creeped out, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't walk through your basic haunted house."
4,"Seemingly run by a husband-wife combo, this is a really nice little Italian place for lunch. It's a bit imbissy with its high, small tables, but the food is great and a reasonable price. I had a Diavolo pizza and it was the best pizza that I've had in a long time. I'll be back"
2,"You really feel like you are on the beach. Wonderful but it remembers a bit on a package tour. Over all the prices. Too expensive. And going to the toilet costs extra.But the excuse is good: The view, the sand.. the summerfeeling."
3,"Great place, friendly (and cheeky!) waiters, tasteful food served in decent portions. Has all the Chinese classics that Europeans like without taking too much of the authenticity away."
3,"nice burrito place in the Grindelviertel. I've been to the one at Osterstrasse before, but here it was a little more complicated to order your burrito with your choice of all the different toppings. Kinda like ordering a subway sandwich. But my burrito was pretty tasty. The should have some sauces on the table, however, and I didn't like my friends' Guacamole too much."
1,"If you need food come here, if you need good food, look elsewhere.Service is good, but it's not thai food they are serving, but on the other hand, it is boring and tasteless."
2,"Had a moderately-sized schnitzel here for lunch today. It really hit the spot without being amazing. I ordered a Jägerschnitzel (comes with Mushrooms), but those who ordered just a plain schnitzel got monstrously big ones! The service was unintrusive and reasonably prompt. The prices are great. Schnitzel and fries for 5eu :) --- Further to the above review, I've since been back twice. The first time was much the same, but the second time they were incredibly inattentive and slow. It took them literally 15 minutes to notice that our group of 15 had walked through the door. They then took forever to bring a few of the meals, and my schnitzel had a large fraction of inedible gristle in it. I'd still go again, but they're losing a star off the rating."
3,"Nice cozy restaurant featuring Franconian cuisine and drinks.Pros: Friendly, multi-lingual staff with English menusPet friendlyCons: Pet friendly"
3,"I went there for lunch. The food tastes good and the service is lightning fast. The saladbar was fresh, but they could have given us a broader sortiment to chose from.Overall: Good place for a quick meal."
1,"Dinner for two on Friday night! Showing up at 6 o'clock we were the only guests. The restaurant filled up quickly. The service was friendly and fast, implicating that the food was premade... We ordered humus as a starter. Unfortunately we returned most of it. The bread was stale. The main dish was nothing special. The rice was over cooked.Besides that the location and the service were good. Might return to grab a drink but no food!"
3,Very good food and friendly service. I've had very good Fish & chips ( crispy and not fat). Not expensive considering the neighbourhood. I recommand it !
1,"Limited menu (5 main course besides burgers) but at least they had an English version! Ordered the burrata, which at 18.5€ was pricey but that's because it is about three times normal size. Sadly, it lacked flavor and didn't have the soft, buttery consistency I was hoping for. Also ordered a burger with melted onions. Came so full of creamy sauce it was dripping. Had to scrape a ton of extra mayo sauce off to be edible. Tasted ok, but not worth the trouble. Also, don't say yes when they all you if you want one dish before another... They won't put in the order for your second until your first is gone (even if it's a huge barrata big enough for 4 people). Sat awkwardly waiting for my burger for over half an hour before she asked if I finally wanted it... Uhgg. This place was meh, and I wouldn't return."
3,This Jim Block restaurant is located close to Gänsemarkt. It is nicely decorated and clean. The staff was very nice and the food was good. It is a great fast food alternative.The entrance is even with the ground.
4,"Fantastic venue for beach-related sport in Hamburg, including football, volleyball and swimming. There are around 4 pitches, several bars, BBQs, with great music and DJs. We were there to compete in the annual Hamburg netsoccer clash, where Qype came out on top!"
2,The Joh. Albrecht Brewery is located at a fleet close to the town hall. If you are lucky or reserve a table you can have a great view of the fleet. The decoration is typical for a German brewery restaurant and the staff was very nice. The food was solid German food. With fair prices considering the size of the dish and the location of the restaurant. The beer (brewed at the restaurant) is very good and there is an offer of different kinds. Enjoy :-)
4,"My favorite attraction in Hamburg. If I have friends who are visiting, I bring end our tour of the Speicherstadt and Hafencity with an outing to Miniatur-Wunderland. I've been several times now and am never disappointed. You can spend hours just looking at everything. Great if you have kids with you but grown-ups will love it, too."
4,"CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!Yes, this is a chocolate lover's dream. It's a chocolate museum and factory with a large specialty chocolate shop attached. Hachez chocolate is the magic brand that runs this museum and boy, is it amazing.They have few tours in English (as well as other languages, depending on the season) so make sure you get one in your preferred language as it's a word-heavy tour and you won't understand much if you don't have a full grasp of German. If you have a larger group, you can always contact them for private tours.I've been three times and every time the tour guides were lovely and super excited (who wouldn't be, working with chocolate all day) and very knowledgable. They walk you trough the history of cocoa and chocolate first, you may even get to try a raw, unprocessed cocoa bean straight from the pod! They taste surprisingly citrussy, actually. Not like cocoa at all, or at least the processed cocoa we're accustomed to.Then you're led into their labratory! Which is a large kitchen area where you get to decorate your own bar of chocolate. Upon buying your tour ticket, you can also pay for an extra bar (one bar is included with every entry ticket) and it's well worth it. I get the extra bar every time and make one for a friend or family member.They use high quality milk chocolate and there's a huge selection of toppings for you to use, from sprinkles over gummy bears to praline crumble, coconut flakes and chocolate chips, nuts and more. You get to fully customize how much and what you want to put on your chocolate bar(s).After your visit to the laboratory, it's off to the second part of the tour. Here you find out how the process of making raw cocoa beans into actual chocolate works. You're introduced to all methods and machinery and get to sample a lot of the products on the way. And by sample I absolutely mean pig out as they're really generous with their samples if you're nice about it!After the tour concludes you get to wrap your hand decorated bar of chocolate yourself and take it home with you. If it makes it home before ending up in your stomach, that is.The tour might seem a bit on the expensive side, but it's worth every single penny and more. I come back here way too often..."
2,Decent Italian food. It does what it says on the tin.
4,"Fabulous!! FIRST: make a reservation! SECOND: eat the entire pizza. We had a party of six with a reservation and were seated within minutes and served some of the best food of our lives. Do t miss this place!! Fun, loud and cramped in all the best ways."
4,"Sudhang was a great dinner choice for our 1st night in Hamburg.  We visited in the 2nd weekend in December and it was bustling with booked Christmas parties.  Although we were lucky to get a table, ours was far too small and so there were lots of shuffling dishes around during the meal.  But the owner warned us of this in advance and my friend assured us that it was too good to pass up.  Definitely recommend a reservations as the place is small and cozy, and clearly very popular.  We went with the specials/set menu and the goat cheese soup was delicious, the monkfish main was succulent and juicy, and the shared dessert between the 4 of us was enough to satisfy everyone's sweet tooth.  The staff was friendly & helpful and recommended some excellent wine, as there was quite a large selection.  Inside is romantically dark and the vibe is relaxed and cool, and my friend who lives right around the corner frequents the place for the great food, atmosphere, and homey-feel to the place.  Definitely worth a visit for tourists & locals alike!"
3,"It's difficult to find good Asian restaurants in Germany that try to deliver a food experience close enough to their native kitchen in their homeland. The Quan Do is certainly a recommendation for those who despise the stereo-typical, sweet-sour fast food style pseudo Asian kitchen. The food is fresh, simple and soul soothing. For friends of a good Pho this is a good address. I also like their summer rolls.The staff is always friendly and competent, you can tell they like working there. The place is always crowded and does not take reservations, so at peak times you need to calculate some waiting time to be seated. The Quan Do is not a suitable choice if you're in a hurry to grab a lunch for example during your work break.The Quan Do is also nicely decorated with Vietnamese lamps hanging from the ceiling and nice photography of Vietnamese street scenes.I would grant a fifth star if the food was even more authentic to the taste in Vietnam or ethnic tribe area of South China, bordering Vietnam."
3,Quaint little spot. Perfect for a latte and a cake. Very good spot to sit and relax. Nice selection of baked goods and coffee is not too strong. There is a WC in the back which was very clean.
4,"Very busy and popular place with excellent food and service! The staff was friendly and smiling, and the food was flavorful and attractive (my fish was cooked perfectly). The tables are very close and crammed, which is a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, the environment is enjoyable."
4,As a UNESCO World Heritage site the warehouse district shouldn't be missed. If you're anything like me and have a thing for bridges in architecture you'll be a happy camper. I love walking around and seen the locks on the bridges and the views down the canals. Read up on some of the history about the warehouse district and how it came to be a UNESCO heritage site. There's some great spots for pictures and just to get a nice walk in.
4,Heaven for runners. Follow this route if you live in Eppendorf. joggingroutes.org/2012/1…
4,"A must visit in HamburgTip: book your ticket online in advance to save moneyWe booked our tickets online in advance. Online, it charges 1 euro for the processing fee, however, you save a certain percentage (5% - 50%) for some early and late time slots.The Airbnb host told us to book in advance because the lineup may get very long.We came on a Wednesday night around 7 pm, there was hardly anyone lineup. The staff let us came early even though we booked tickets for a later time slot. I think we spent 3 hours at this place. It has too much to see.This place is definitely the highlight of Hamburg. I think Hamburg does not have too much tourist things to do, so this is the best tourist activity we did in Hamburg."
4,"Easy atmosphere for an English speaker.  Good selection of local and regional beers.  I started with a sampler flight and moved on to local bottles.  Staff was willing to help with my selections since I didn't have knowledge of the region.  Bartender even went back to ask the owner about a selection she choose for me and then changed it on his suggestion.  Limited snack menu, but the pot roast style burger was good.  I'll be back."
0,"Just had a dinner as a family of three at Khan. In short: I can not recommend.The meat quality is really low, hygiene is problematic,if you have a baby the only edible stuff is some chicken and sweet stuff.If you leave any food on your plate they will come and warn you and penalize you €5s per person that you did not eat all on your plate.Sorry, no one needs such a dinner."
4,So my friend this is a special Ice cream shop. Maybe the best ice cream in Hamburg.Its not cheapest one but ist delicious.
4,"I love having lunch on fridays at the Kornhauskeller. The staff is very friendly, lunch prices are well affordable and the dishes are always clean, tasty, fresh and very well prepared. My favorite is the fish in mustard seed sauce, but their falafel is the best I've had in Hamburg by far. Very very recommended! A Hamburg favorite!"
4,Best quality Indian food around Hamburg.Love the way they received us...Kebabs and chef special fish fry is a must try..!Desserts & samosas are freshly made and tasty
3,"Katze is a cool new bar on the Schulterblatt. As you might guess from the name is a little bit cat-themed, but not much, because that would probably be rubbish. At the time of writing (6 November '08) this bar is so new that it still smells of wet varnish and paint, and the outside of the bar looks unfinished - there's no name for example. The bar staff are mostly young, attractive and blonde. The punters seem to be of a similar ilk, but maybe not quite as blonde. There are free bar snacks on every table, but they don't serve any hefeweizen. However they make up for this small oversight by serving Augustiner brau. It'll be interesting to see how this one develops, but things are looking good at the moment."
4,"What a gem this place is.  I walked a solid 2 miles from the S-Bahn to get here, as it's nestled in a Hamburg neighborhood.  It's not a tourist spot.  It was worth the walk.Landhaus Scherrer is an interesting combination of first class and family in its decor and service. The single waiter than handled my room was a gentleman - thoughtful, professional, and capable of a laugh at the sight of a child (a family was dining that night).  The greeting woman seemed quite similar - a bit serious at first, but clearly very kind if you needed help.So the atmosphere was excellent, but the food actually topped it.  This is no neighborhood comfort food.  After picking out an incredibly inexpensive (but good) wine for me, the waiter brought out a complementary plate of variations on a pumpkin theme - ice cream, custard, pumpkin slices, etc, all prepared differently and all wonderful.  After a salad came the crusted duck dish. It was one of the best duck dishes I've ever had - full of flavor and wonderfully prepared.  I also had an excellent desert, but I can't recall it any longer.In sum, Landhaus Scherrer is a real find for a visitor of Hamburg.  I hope it's well-known by the locals.  Regardless, all who visit or live in Hamburg should stop in."
4,"The best breakfast in the city. Really advisable. Studentenfrühstück only 5,50EUR. And coffee as much as you want. The atmosphere is really comfi and when the sun is shining you can sit outside and feel the Schanzenvibe. In the peak time it's quite crowded. So get up early enough or reserve a table."
2,"I had a nice solo lunch at this Bok! I read about it on Yelp as being a fairly decent and relaxed place for Asian food. The menu is in German and English. I had a chicken dish with yellow curry and various veggies, it came with a side of white rice. They claim it's one of the spicy dishes - I'd argue that, but, I'm from Oakland, California, where there are 10 spicy Asian restaurants within a block radius of my house - and we're spoiled. So when I come to Northern Europe and get ""spicy"" food it's often not spicy. But, it was warm and tasty and the restaurant had great music playing. I enjoyed it - I just needed something quick and warming in between work. Thanks Bok for delivering it! (And yes, too many locations in one area..very confusing :) )"
3,"Small and cozy place with a lot of great food. We went there for late breakfast. The pancake with blueberries are amazing. The homefries they serve are also amazing. And everything there is vegetarian, most things even vegan. The vegan bacon was really good."
4,"I ended up here by accident one Sunday afternoon when a heavy thunderstorm turned the Hafencity into an extension of the Elbe river. The place was tightly packed with people looking for refuge from the storm. I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and the low prices for coffee drinks (about a Euro less than Starbucks and Balzac for a large latte). They also offers salads and noodle dishes in addition to great sandwiches. Summary: Lovely chain coffee shop that offers more food choices and cheaper and better coffee than Starbucks and Balzac. Interior is stylish and staff is very friendly. My favorite coffee place now, other locations are nice as well."
3,"Fine fast food place. The burger and bun were fine and so were the fries. Nothing extraordinary or  different, but a fine meal and good distance from the train station where we arrived."
4,Très bon wine bar Olive jambon cru pasta et Entrées excellentesTrès bon vin aussiUn régalAccueil chaleureux et amical
0,"Service was from a young man who couldn't speak any German and who's English was very difficult to understand. Jumbo plate was good, obviously basic but what was expected.Red blue and white burger was gross. Way too much blue cheese - unbalanced flavors. Soggy buns. The patty was sub-par as well. Have had a lot of blue cheese burgers in the last year so I know a gross burger when I taste it.Macaroni and cheese tasted artificial and was too strong.To sum it up: the food at Hard Rock Cafe is dated. The times have changed and both the rest of the world and Germany have gotten very good at food and flavor. Hard rock cafes food no longer has that extra something - it has been overtaken by amazing alternatives!"
4,"A good and reasonably priced place for getting lunch. Long queue around noon but fast service. Also, they only accept cash:("
4,immer & immer wieder SUPER !!! Excellent & herrvorragend einfach !From the very best for the price !
4,This place is Amazing!! The servers are very attentive and very nice and the food is great! All the food is very fresh and it doesn't break your wallet and the portions are huge.
4,"Cracking little Mexican cafe/bar serving real mexican food, the likes of which, I had never tasted! It's a lot like mud, basically, but made from chocolate, and call Mole. Maybe it's made from moles? Of course, the real attraction here is the extensive range of tequila, some of which didn't even make us projectile vomit across the table! Actually I suspect there may have been a little chundering but hell, it's all good."
4,"Great restaurant! A nice place, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The meal were excellents, the meet soft and tasty, the side dish good but perhaps a little bit too simple, and the price was fully justified (we were even expecting to pay more). I only can recommend this place for people who are looking for a little more sophisticated dinner."
2,"i like to go there sonetimes to eat a very fatty Schnitzel...but the place is not so clean,the service is average and not very friendly and most of the times they get my drink order wrong.The food is average but good enough to go there with some friends for not soending too much money"
4,"Really excellent food.  Very nice atmosphere and friendly attentive staff.  Has two menus - Italian and English, both on huge chalkboard.  These are their daily specials.I'd come back!"
4,"When I first came here just over a year ago I was shocked that such a place existed in Hamburg. It's really great, but I can't imagine coming here much more than once a year.. playing sports in soft sand is just too tiring! Both of my visits here have been for a beach football competition. The first time I was injured and so hung around drinking beer all day. More recently (last weekend) I was playing and I'm still feeling the pain. Beach football is dangerous! Still, it's a great asset for Hamburg to have such a facility."
3,"I really should come here more often, considering that it's across the street from me. I like it here because it makes for both a great coffee shop during the day and a really nice (albeit a quite loud) bar during the evening. They serve soy-based drinks, which is a major plus, and coffee until late. Need to remember to come here on a wednesday for some live jazz!"
3,"We went there to grab some breakfast. They are not only a cafe but they also do lunch and other small snacks. I chose the soy yogurt with nuts and honey, which I found in their refrigerated section. They offer two different flavors of soy yogurt. They also have quite a big and tasty looking selection of sandwiches and bagels on display. Interior is nice and welcoming, prices are moderate, some are okay others are overpriced (2€ for fruit infused water) but all in all it's a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch."
3,With its glorious trees and other greenery the outside spaces here are a great place to sit out in during the day doing a bit of people watching or just listening to the wind through the branches.Internally it's comfortable & inviting with decent service and the ostrich wrap and goats cheese salad make for a great sharing combination.
3,"It's always nice to chase away the daily routine at Café du Passage in Winterhude. It's like a little hideout with its friendly staff and the nice food & bev. You can get anything from breakfast over quiche to cakes and it's all yummy, promised.As a plus there's a vast selection of tea available, too.Prices are fine and so is the interior. It's just set up with heart and soul. You can nearly feel it.It's just lovely to sit (inside or outside) there and goggle at the passersby. Alternatively you can read magazines and books if you feel like wanting a quiet time to yourself.Once you were lucky enough to find this little jewel I bet you will keep coming back again and again and again and again"
4,"What a great little cafe. Just stumbled upon it today with an acquaintance who recommended we stop in for an espresso. We ended up having a piece of homemade cake and this was fantastic. The majority of things sold here homemade and everything looks spectacular. The primary goal of the place is to sell tidewood but I think they do more business as a cafe. If you can find it, definately make sure to stop in. Although we had very little to do with the service personnel, it seems like everyone there was really nice. People were also hanging out there during the middle of the day, in a workweek. Seems like an awesome place to stop in for a coffee and just enjoy time passing by."
4,Boys and girls if you like rock music and if you are looking for one of the best rocking pubs in hamburg this is the place to go!
3,"Went here with someone who had already been there once. I am impressed. Reminded me of the restaurant in the Alsterhaus where you can pick your own food (raw) and have it prepared in front of you. The selection at Copper House is much more extensive and the price is right if you are hungry. I truly enjoyed the food as you can have it made exactly as you wish with the specific sauces you choose yourself. Service is also super nice and I never felt like anything lacked. They didn't bother us when we didn't want to be bothered but were right there as soon as you needed them. Drinks were good as well. Finally, I didn't really miss a large dessert selection as I was already so full from the three plates I had prepared, mostly with fish and vegetables. One minus point is that I am getting somewhat tired of this design style. It looks like every other designer place. It's quite nice so don't get me wrong. It's just not different."
2,"This is a good place for lunch if you're looking for something on the healthy side. If I were vegetarian, I would probably eat here a lot. The food isn't strictly vegetarian, but most of the dishes are, or at least lean in that direction (meat as an accompaniment, rather than the main event).I've tried their pasta (I think it was gnocchi), and their sweet potato curry (with chickpeas). Both dishes were filling but not exactly bursting with flavor. The rice that came with my curry had been par-boiled, and then boiled again just before serving, but apparently not enough because it was still a little too chewy.On the plus side, food is served cafeteria-style, so you can get in and out quickly, and you can see what you're getting.Not my favorite place for lunch, but not terrible, either."
3,"Fine cup of coffee - and such friendly service. Its a bit scruffy, but in a nice way. My son had a truly fresh mint tea = hot water + mintstick with leaves. Thats the best way to make a mint tea - love it. They also serve a fresh ginger tea. I would do that if I happened to come by again."
4,The town hall of Hamburg is with his 647 rooms bigger than the Buckingham Palace.Some places of the town hall are only visitable through a guidance. Conclusion:The town hall of Hamburg is very historical and beautiful. It is a visit worth!
4,"StrandPauli is a nice place, really well located. You can chill on the deckchairs resting on the sand and enjoy the cocktails. They offer free glasses of water which is a big plus for me, as many places don't want to, even if it is tap water."
4,"This is place is GREAT, you can definitely tell it from how many Asian show up here. I love the fried chicken here , so juicy. Miso ramen and soysauce ramen are both good. The highball was in a wrong glass but tastes good. Finally the desert, mochi is my favorite, and I can't wait to try mocha ice cream next time."
4,Nice spot on the Alster! Was here to enjoy the sun and this location is fantastic... It is without service but associates are friendly and they as well offer food (BBQ) when the weather is good. The prices are fair and you can rent boats etc if you are up for it.
3,"Watched Deutschland lose their World Cup match here, which hurt the mood, but the food and beer were very good. I actually had the best Schweinshaxe ever and most of the time it is pretty good anywhere, you really need at least 2 people so don't order any apps if you go for that glorious piece of pork. Nice friendly service and good place to catch some sports action!"
3,Pretty decent bar aside all the Reeperbahn turbulences.Very friendly barkeeps which know their profession and will make sure you get the drink you want.
3,"The best thing about this place is that it's quiet later in the evening, which is when my boyfriend and I usually go there. It's also on the cheap side. The dishes we've tried so far taste very good. No idea if they are traditional Thai/whatever dishes, but we don't care about that as long as they taste good."
4,"We went during a weekday during lunch time & avail the lunch menu. It was not full, thus, we enjoyed a good service from them. They have a variety of dimsums to choose from. Choices for the main course is also very good. The menu have english translation/description in it and the waitress can speak mandarin. The prices are affordable. Each of the menu comes with a complimentary appetizer: soup -or- springroll. We enjoyed all the dishes (see submitted photos) and giving them all two thumbs up! The restaurant size is kinda small, but they do have two big round tables available for people coming in groups. Will definitely come back & will definitely recommend to others."
4,"Snacking might be tricky when you are trying to achieve your fitness goals. I finally stumbled upon the perfect option for whenever I want to cheat a little on my diet. This is by far my ultimate favorite relatively healthy snack in the world and I find excuses out of anything to go there and enjoy either a quarkbecher, a shake or frozen Quark.This time I had the ""Fit Macher"" which has sugar free Quark, fruits and Müsli. But I do recommend you try their more exotic flavors such as Detox Kelch with kale and chia or the ""Warm Up"". In Terms of location, don´t expect some fancy trendy Café or anything like that. It is really just a booth, but their product is amazing so don´t let that disuade you from trying it out. Also sometimes you can find them on Food markets or events around Hamburg. Just Keep your eyes open. You got to try them all!Mucho love,D."
3,Very nice and ... Thai atmosphere. Good service and very good food. Expensive but quality kitchen.
2,"I was unimpressed by this place. Had wanted to come here for a while as I had heard good things. Well, we finally reserved a table and tried it out. Nice location, ok ambiance and fairly nice staff. Yet, the food is totally mediocre. There is nothing special about it and even though the menu changes on a regular basis, we found it tough to find something we ""really"" wanted to order. Almost left because of this but had a go at it anyway. Oh well, we should of maybe left yet then I wouldn't of known how the food was.We won't be back but maybe it's just not our thing. It was really full and this on a Tuesday night. People do seem to like the place and in general it is good. Yet, if you're here for the food, I'd go elsewhere.Finally, I ordered a souffle for dessert. After coming out once and telling us it collapsed and there were going to try again, they brought out a failed attempt. After two tries, they couldn't get it right. Hence they brought one out which was all over the plate. It still tasted fine but to be honest, I would of simply said, ""hey, we can't get the souffle right tonight....have something else and it's on us!"" This alone would of had me come back to give them another chance. Yet, nope, they basically said we can't get it right so eat it this way....regardless of the poor presentation of the dish.I know this is nitpicking but it's why I go to restaurants and don't cook for myself at home. The ""show"" is part of the reason I am willing to pay higher prices. Oh well, we'll find something else I am sure."
4,"Fuck yeah, finally some pizza that doesn't leave me hating myself and my choices in food delivery."
3,"Looks like I'm going to have to go ahead and edit my review again, bringing Viale Antico back up to 4 stars. The service seems to have gone back to it's original, snappy self - I guess last summer wasn't a good time for them. Their prices, however, have remained higher than they originally were. I haven't gone back with a large party so I'm not sure how they'll handle more than a few people, but I've been coming here once a week with one or two lunch-mates and the service has been friendly and snappy. I like that at Viale Antico I can order whatever I want - regardless of if it's on the menu or not - and I can ask for any modifications of menu items. --- ORIGINAL EDIT --- Unfortunately I'm going to have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant to two stars. In the past few months, the quality of service has dropped dramatically and the prices of the dishes have increased. More times than not, two or more of our party have been receiving their dish considerably later (up to 40min) than the rest of us and the staff has been rude to us, which provides for an uncomfortable and nerve-wrecking lunch experience. At this point in time I cannot recommend Bistro Viale Antico. --- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW --- Bistro Viale Antico is across the street from the new Qype HQ on Deichstrasse. We strolled upon it accidentally this afternoon as a part of our lunch-hour-wander, to find restaurants in the area. I ordered the Scampi pasta, which was probably one of the better Scampi pastas I've had. Most other restaurants drench the spaghetti in sauce and throw in a few scampis. The pasta I received had a very light garlic/butter sauce with fresh herb seasoning and had plenty of scampi. The price was reasonable. 7.50eu is what I paid for my dish, which is higher than I'm accustomed to, but the quality of the service and food was much higher than I am accustomed to, as well."
0,"The food was good - the service appalling. The server made extremely intrusive and inappropriate comments to my face about my breasts and figure, several times, invited another waiting customer to comment on them, and then called over another worker to share in this frankly appalling objectification of a paying customer and human being. Would never recommend this establishment to any woman who doesn't want to risk being hit on and objectified, and trapped in an extremely uncomfortable situation while your food is in the process of being made Overall - disgusting treatment of female customers, left me feeling revolted and uncomfortable."
4,"From the moment we wandered into the back room where the stage was all set up like an old-fashioned living room complete with standard lamp and occassional table, I fell in love with Pony Bar. Friendly staff provided us with vegan-friendly sandwiches and delicious cocktails and coffees and we felt very much at home during our gig there. The venue is a little gem."
4,This is THE place to go get a burger! I have to say that although I mostly prefer white meat and many times vegan meals - I love to go get myself a juicy one there! Its that amazing! The meat is good quality steak meat and the buns are from this great bread made with egg Apart from all.. There are real potato fresh made fries that I usually just get to taste after im super full with the burger. Loving them though my fav is Da Birdhouse with double patties. Thats one cheerful place besides the great food!
4,"Super friendly staff that made you feel like you were in Italy until you stepped back out in the Hamburg rain. The pizza was amazing and I managed to finish one on my own, which is rare, but it was so good I simply couldn't stop."
4,This place had bags of potential when it first opened  but now it is absolutely spot on. Friendly people and great waffles and icecream!
0,"Im really dissapointed about this bar..First impression was ok, nice atmosphere, funky interior and good sounds.After 5 minutes I felt like leaving as soon as possible.Its way too packed, dancing is almost impossible, and the 50degrees temperature doesnt feel like any festivity either..The music is good though, charts mixed up with good tunes, house/rnb style. Among the crowd students and older, lost tourists tried to get drunk and create themselves a good night out.Mine was everything except that.. When this old lady with yellow glasses and 60s jeans started to dance like a fool..she must have been on drugs, although that must be a weird combination as she looked like a lost schoolteacher from kindergarten, I had to move myself at least 1m to the left, just to ensure myself not to get involved in her wild expressional, private dance. After my friend Kat almost got smashed to the ground and hurt her knee by some drunk fat yuppies, we decided to leave... I wont be back. But I probably visited Hörsaals worst night..."
4,"Für preiswerte 3,70EUR gibt es hier eine Mahlzeit in Form einer gefüllten Backkartoffel. Diese wird mit Kräuterbutter und Käse vermengt und nach Belieben gefüllt. Besonders toll für Vegetarier! Houmus, Couscous und etliche tolle Saucen lassen das Ganzezu einem sehr leckerem und abwechslungsreichem Essen werden. Weil wir eine Zeit lang jeden Tag hier waren, haben wir das ein oder andere Getränk auf's Haus bekommen. Sehr nette Bedienung, obwohl das von Person zu Person ziemlich schwankt Auf die Kartoffel kommt es an! :) auf der Schanze ein Muss!"
2,"I was not happy with the cocktails I ordered: - Moskow Mule the taste was completely off and they did not serve it in a moscow mule mug- Whiskey sour is too sour :)The service was fast and friendly though, the atmosphere was a chillaxing one and the music was just right."
4,"Top place! Absolutely a must try! Cool ipad ordering system, nice food ;) recommended"
2,"3 stars because i am not a fan of zoos. and because its not THAT bigBut ive been told this is the biggest privately financed zoo in germany. i went there during the jungle nights in june. entrance costs 17.5EUR (1.5EUR extra to the normal days)On that night, the zoo was open till at least 11.30 with shows all over the zoo. Well as i said before i am not a fan of zoos, so i cant say i had a lot of fun. It's not very big but has a number of different exotic animals. But the thing is I've been to the Leipzig zoo and the leipzig one was much bigger than hamburgs with much more variety. So i was kinda suprised that hamburgs zoo wasnt 'small' And on that evening, hagenbecks was really full, and a lot of kids running back and forth. They seemed to be enjoying their time. Now that i have seen the zoo, supported it financially, i don't think i will be back.Ive seen their lions, pinguins, giraffes, monkeys, tigers, lions ... so i dont need to come back to see them all over again :P Oh and the kangaroo part of the zoo stinks by the way, i couldnt stay inside more than 30 seconds! The best part is that you can feed the animals, had i known i would have taken some fruits and veggies with me... However, worth the visit. I dont regret going there at all!"
4,"Holy cow!  What a great meal. We were off to a rough start with a small language barrier and seating. (We we're asked to change tables twice). But it really didn't matter in the end because everyone was great. The restaurant is small and got very busy. You should make reservations. The food was excellent and fresh. Kudos to the staff that seemed all family, but I'm not sure. Go here if you are in the area."
3,"I like Thämers. It offers a friendly, beery old-style pub ambience without a hint of oompahpah or that sneaking suspicion that they're putting it on just for you. Much more personality than the other offerings at Großneumarkt. Food is hearty but good (mountains of bratkartoffeln with everything!) and I find myself coming back here often for dinner and to sit and read outside over a beer and enjoy the balmy summer evenings."
2,"Went there for a business dinner. Recommended by a colleague.The beer is good, but given the fact that they are a brewery, choices you have a a bit sparse.The craft been (only one available) is lacking a proper description.Food is OK. Waiters however were good - friendly, quick. Location is very nice.Noise Level to high for business lunch - unless of course you are looking for Nomunication."
4,All the tourists that visit Hamburg have to see the Rathaus (town hall) of Hamburg. It was build 1897 out of granite and sandstone. The roof is made out of copper. Just go in the city center of Hamburg and you will see the magnificent building. Secret hint: Between the windows you can see the 20 kings of the old German empire. Another hint: Find within the inner yard the fountain Hygieia-Brunnen that was made in memory of the victory against the cholera epidemic in 1892.
4,"Ok, this is official. Milch is my favorite coffee place in Hamburg now. Flat white is amazing good."
3,"the burgers and fries were yummy but couldn't finish them all since the quantity was huge! burger without the bun should be the best as they come with salad and could be a healthier option! the chicken cheese burger was tasty but as time went, their special mayo was getting saltier - the sad part. but overall was a good lunch as the first meal in Hamburg and for a good price :)"
4,"One of my favourite restaurants of the area. They got a lot of nice Portuguese and Spanish food on offer as well as the usual San Miguel and Sagres beer. Loads of yummy seafood things (meat, too, for all you carnivores) and great tapas. All very delicious. Aioli and bread will get served before the main meal so you can feast on that first. And it's worth it. Even though your partner / colleagues will hate you later on / the next day.The waiters are really pleasant - and always happy to deliver a wisecrack on top of it all.Prices are moderate especially compared to the other Portuguese restaurants in the middle of the street.It's strongly recommended."
4,So neat! It is 2 floors for very detailed sceneries. Spent about an hr and a half there and definitely could use more time if it wasn't closing. The best part was the replica of the airport with planes taking off and landing.
3,"Simple place to grab an authentic and really good Italian coffee, pasta, or toasts. Friendly, popular ... and I'd go from 3.5 * to 4.0 * if they managed to clean out the cardboard, boxes, Amazon shipments and stuff on the floor next time I visit. ;)"
4,Had Bananenbrot and Vegetable Quiche with Salad yesterday. Both were so delicioussssss and of high quality. Veggies are so fresh. Quiche was just perfect. And Bananenbrot was just so yummy I had to eat in a row in 2 days. The restaurant is lovely and the staff are very nice. Highly recommended!
2,"This place has 4.5 stars with the most reviews(over 1500) compared to all other vietnamese restaurants in the area based on google. So coming here from orange county I am on a hunt for good vietnamese food to prepare for the future homesickness. First impression: spacious seating area. Self seated. Line moves decently quick. Ordering food with Vietnamese worked for me since I don't speak German and lady waitress doesn't seem to know English. She came about 2 minutes after I found myself a seat. Very attentive. I got a pho bò since....what else is there to eat on a gloomy day at a vietnamese place. To be honest I was disappointed because I didn't taste beef broth I was expecting. More seasoned boiled water than broth. Noodles were not boiled soft enough for my taste but I understand that some people do prefer that over soft fresh noodles. Pho didn't come with fresh herbs on the side like usual so I was bummed out as well. I love bean sprouts in my pho. Overall, this is a place to go to if you work around the area and need a quick lunch. I don't hate it but didn't love it either. Maybe there are other items on the menu that could be a hit."
4,"I'm the fans of this restaurant as I was living around the corner of the it. I haven't been here for a long time after I moved out this district. I was here again for their Tuesday 3 courses Menu which costs €19,90. You can pick up either fish or meat on the main course. I was very very happy and satisfied as their cooking was no change at all, still keeping their high standard. I'm sure I will come again and it's highly recommended."
4,"Excellent service, atmosphere and food. The Pänang curry crisp duck was perfect. The price was VERY reasonable. The best meal we have had in Hamburg thus far. I wish I had had room for the soups and desserts. Go early or wait long."
4,Tasty Food. Quick Service. Was Three dir Lunch. Menu was a bit hard to read from far away written on the board. But waiter helped us choose the right dish for us.
4,"Great food, nice service, good atmosphere! You get a tasty treat of flat bread with olive oil and an herb mix to enjoy while you're waiting for your mealand it's worth the wait. Unique flavors, trendy style. More of a fusion/modern cuisine than Lebanese  excellent food! Be sure to reserve a seat if you want to go on the weekend."
2,Nice little cafe where you can grab a selection of teas and snacks along with some typical main dishes of pastas etc.Nice areas to sit and chat or if you are by yourself grab a paper and catch up on the worlds going on.
3,"Great location, nice ambience, friendly staff with unbeatable price. Will definitely come back!"
4,"Great caïpirinha !!! If you need to refresh yourself, you found the good place. Katze is a nice bar located in Sternchanze and they have friendly waiters that even gave us water for free. They have a Happy Hour while you can have a caïpirinha for only 4,50€. Don't hesitate, they worth it!"
3,"Pretty awesome salads! Best I've had so far in hamburg. I had the 'Zeigenkäse' salad which is a goat's cheese and honey salad with some grains, cranberries and a mix of lettuce. I picked the sweet chili orange sauce. All in all a very good and very filling salad. All the ingredients complemented each other well. The large size is really large. I was pleased.About the place: It's a salad bar with the option of picking your base, couple of ingredients (grains, cranberries etc) and your protein (chicken, halloumi or goats cheese) and a dressing. Alternatively you can instead pick one of their preexisting salads. Basically your standard salad bar; these are unfortunately uncommon here"
2,"Firstly, the food is simple but tasty. A little bit expensive for some eggs and toast though. We we're sitting for ages waiting to be given a menu, maybe you had to go get one yourself, which I ended up doing. Waited another age to be served, the staff were more interested in cleaning tables. It wasn't even that busy. We didn't get the portions of home fries we ordered on the side and had to remind the girl after our main meal was almost gone. They came out 5 minutes later. All in all, could rate it higher of the staff were a little more attentive!"
3,"This place was great. In the lovely Portuguese quarter. The pizza we had was delicious, and the service was nice."
4,"The food here is unique. It is austrian with some traditional German plates. They were very friendly, even finding us a table without a reservation. A recommendation : make a reservation at first, just to be safe. They are also happy to have dogs there. To get there by public transport, ones can take the S1 to poppenbüttel or bus 8 to poppenbüttel Bahnhof and walk from there."
2,"A nice restaurant, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The quality of the food was good and the meels were all typically german or austrian... But it was really not as elaborate as to justify the high prices."
3,"Finally, Turkish food that's not döner!We had to go to Ikea and instead of having Swedish meatballs like we always do when we go to Ikea, we decided to venture out a bit. With a little help from Yelp, we found Köz Urfa. I'm thinking I will find more occasions to go to Ikea now because of this delightful Turkish restaurant. This restaurant is HUGE! And there's a cave area for more intimate dining. We arrived a little after 5pm, so the place wasn't very full up. The various kebaps are neatly displayed in large refrigerated glass cases. The dining room was bright and clean, and the staff is super inviting and friendly.I ordered the Urfa kebap while the hubby ordered the Adana kebap. I believe the difference was his was spicy and mine was not. For 11€ per plate, you get a lot of food. The meat is laid on top of a half and half bulgar and rice. You also get like 5 different sides and some grilled veggies, as well as a side of flatbread. I was not able to finish my plate, but I guess next time I'll come hungrier.I'm very much looking forward to coming back. There are so many dishes to try, plus all the dessert!"
3,"Visited here looking to cure some homesickness, since Hawaii is basically Japan-lite. I ordered gyoza and chashu shoyu ramen, my friend had the kimchee shoyu ramen. The gyoza were very tasty but the meat inside, like other asian ground meat I've had in Germany, had a finer, grainer consistency than I'm used to. That said, the flavor was excellent.Both shoyu ramens had a rich flavor which was lovely to eat inside while listening to the cold rain outside. However, I think the soups should've been kept at a hotter temperature. Also, each bowl only had one leaf of bak choy and very few condiments otherwise. There was plenty of meat in my chashu bowl which I guess is the ""best"" part, but I like some more greens, too! Where's the nori? Is that just a Hawaii-Japanese thing?The ambiance is very calm, quiet, Japanese. Like I said earlier, sitting inside with ramen and hot gyoza is perfection when the weather is crappy out. Price was reasonable, too, whole meal was about 31 euro."
3,"In this area there are a lot of restaurants and Imbiss and it's really difficult to make a choice. From my experience, this is a good one. I've been here thrice and I always trieddifferent dishes and always left completely satisfied. It's not the cheapest place you can find, but probably one of the best in terms of quality. They've got a fixed menu for dinner and for lunch, one can order something from the latter at any time but in the evening it's slightly more expensive. I would recommend to try meat dishes, I still have to try fish but if you are into that there are probably a few better options in this area. Definitely try it, I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself wanting to come back after the first visit."
4,"Ja ja der Elbstrand, was wir da schon alles erlebt haben , (als wir noch jung waren xD) haben dort oft gegrillt, (Party gemacht) uvm. Ach ja . ich vermisse die Zeiten total .. aber man wird älter und hat nicht mehr so die Zeit wie früher :( Schade eig. aber naja kann man nicht ändern :( Der Elbstrand ist auf jeden Fall total toll =)"
4,"Amazing food, great service, one of the best low-key restaurants I have been to in a long time. The menu changes daily based on what fish is fresh that day. All the food is melt-in-your-mouth good  - amazing seafood and an incredible parmesan pasta dish with truffles. Very nice, but not too fancy. Pretty much a perfect dining experience!"
4,"I wanted to eat something other than train station food on my short layover in Hamburg. So Batman was a nice surprise as it was only about a 5 minute walk from the station. I had the Dönor Dürüm for €3.90. It was big, filling, fresh, and really good. Considering I went through Hamburg on trains multiple times during my travels in Europe, I had to stop here every time I came thru."
4,"Dafür 5 Sterne! In diesem Wohnzimmer gibts nur Basics zu trinken. Aber mit diesen Basics wirst Du zu 100% glücklich. Hier gibts die tollsten Sofas, die nettesten Bedienungen, die abgefahrensten Einrichtungsgegenstände und die hübschesten Mädchen. Was willst Du mehr? Ne? Also, dafür 5 Sterne!"
3,"Luigis is a quite nice italian restaurant in the quater Neustadt, also calles portuguese quater. The pizzas are like the pizzas in Italy. The pizza toppings are from very good quality and the various daily menu offers always nice new and traditional pizzas. The pasta is also original italian style.The pizzas are big and crispy. Their quality is excellent and you will not find easy a pizza backery like this in Hamburg.If you want to visit Luigis at the evening, you should better have an reservation. Its always difficult to get a table at the evenings. I can only give this restaurant five stars because of the staff. The staff is italian, but they are always a little bit craggy. But the service is fast and good.I recommend this restaurant for a quick but good lunch or dinner for families and groups, but not for a rendevous."
0,The WORSE customer service I ever faced in my life .. I went with my family asked the hostess about a table ...: she said 45 mins max and she took our number ... went back to her after 45 mins .. she said sorry no tables for u today...  and that she told us waiting time is 2 hrs ... she was treating us extremely bad .. is it because we r from the gulf ? My kids were starving and waiting .. for nothing ...
4,Very good sushi and other dishes! Very nice waiters and good quality fish! Very recommendable!
4,"For me this is the perfect burger place. The sizes of the burgers with a side are perfect for lunch. The taste is different, yet very much on point burgers with the perfect amount of asian flavors. The ambience and service is perfect. I would go here for a mid day burger anytime."
3,"At the higher end of the Hamburg restaurant spectrum, and also a little bit off the beaten track, being as it is in Aldstadt, and nobody comes here at night. However, I had a good time here. The service is excellent, and the standard of food very good too. My main gripe would be that it's completely dead midweek, so really not somewhere you'd want to eat, unless of course, you like sitting alone. As we were having a meeting, that worked out pretty well."
3,"A respectable wine bar. It's not exactly my style, I prefer my wine bars with a bit more flourish and character. If you like the warehouse aesthetic, then this place is for you. The selection was great, the prices weren't too crazy, and the food was delicious. 4/5."
2,"I had been craving Mexican food since moving to Hamburg and this seemed to be one of the better local places from Yelp reviews, so I decided to give it a try this evening.I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender was friendly. I decided to order a beef burrito based on ""burrito"" being in the title of this place; although, people sitting next to me ordered quesadillas which looked great, and there are also enchiladas. There are very above average vegetarian options, including spinach, mushrooms, nopal, tofu, and seitan for burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.The burrito wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great. I liked the texture of the tortilla (pressed on the grill), but the fillings weren't particularly good tasting. I also thought the burrito was lacking flavor and could have used more ingredients (some salsa, sour cream, and guacamole like the quesadillas included certainly would've been nice). The steak, rice, and beans weren't bad but didn't taste particularly good. There were also diced tomatoes and onions that were fine.Overall, I would go here if you're in the mood for Mexican food and in the area because it's not bad, but I can't recommend this place for having a particularly good burrito."
4,Super toller Strand!
3,Impressive and great to see such diverse and exotic animals such as sharks and crocodiles in Hamburg. It is rather expensive so it requires a separate visit to the Tierpark.
4,"Leaning house of awesomeness! This is one of those hidden-away pearls of Hamburg. Sadly, now that Hafen City has been planted, this may become a bit less hidden in the near future. The food, in a word, is KILLER. Try the Hamburg Hamburger... sample the potato salad, or venture into the unknown with the Hamburg Weißwürstchen, either way you will not be leaving hungry or poor. The service is friendly, but very Hamburg... so if you are an ass, they will treat you accordingly. The location is small and very much heeled over like a ship at sea, frozen at a 15º -- while some people find this to be charming... others, as I recently learned, simply can not eat in such an environment. The music is pure Bert Kaempfert classics from 1950 - 1970. If you don't know who Bert Kaempfert is, shame on you! Now go Google him. In summary, if you are in this area and are looking for a place to eat. This is the place. If you want to grab a bite before heading off to the Elbphilharmonie... well, you have time... but this is a good place to spend it."
4,"First time visiting Hamburg and happened upon this gem! This is the most fantastic pizza...I love it...seriously. #likeseriouslybestpizzaeverPros:*As I said, it's one of the best pizzas I've had. Worth every penny.*Quick; ordered when I got there and it was ready in about 10 minutes (no line when I arrived)*Friendly; every employee was kind and had a smile; they were very patient with the ""unsure American"", lol*English-speaking; much to my benefit, the employees spoke English -- I would not have been able to order otherwise.Cons:*small place; not appropriate for a sit-down meal if that's what you want*can be pricy; I got a ""large"" (medium by U.S. standards) with ""all the meats"" (which actually surprised the employees, lol) and paid about 13EUR -- but also like I said, worth every penny!*maybe not the best place/location/area of town for small children*CASH ONLY (I've found this is rather typical around the area in general, but this place only takes cash...be prepared)"
4,"If you are in Hamburg and do not go to Sagner's, you are making a mistake. We were surprised there was not a line around the block given the small restaurant size. We had two excellent apps in the beef carpaccio and the scallops and mushrooms. Make a reservation and go. It is an excellent small family restaurant."
3,"Very tasty semi-upscale food. price is ok. But for real upscale, I had better. Good service. Portions are a bit small. But thats the upscale- thing. Four stars. I do not have complaints, but I think they are trying to be something they are. not quite. Its good, but something is missing."
3,"Once in a while, one simply wants a good steak. After being a vegetarian for a year (and previously spending my time with either fellow vegetarians or kosher-keepers), I had very little experience with Hamburg's selection of meat. After much deliberation, our party of three decided to forego the ide of an upscale steak joint for Hopi - a much recommended, affordable steakhouse in Hoheluft-Ost/Harvestehude. Service was a bit slow to start with, but our meals arrived quickly. I had a ""Hopi Steak"", which was 8.90 for a 200g argentinian beef steak, a baked potato and a piece of garlic bread. The meat was okay - a solid slab of beef, but nothing exceptional. I found it very ""gummy"", hard to cut and chew. I'm not a meat connoisseur, so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about. I finished the meal off with a very yummy tartufo. Overall, I had a good, solid experience at Hopi and I'll be glad to come back. The worth for money is quite good, I'd recommend this for anyone who'd like a laid-back steak dinner in the neighborhood at an affordable price. For me, my quest for a really great steak continues."
4,"This restaurant is AMAZING.  Visiting Hamburg on vacation from the states and we couldn't have chosen a better spot. This restaurant was a 5 min walk from our apartment in the quaint neighborhood of St George.  Inside, the atmosphere/decor carries the charm and history of Hamburg that we were seeking in a true German experience.  We cannot sing the praises of our server, Lokman (or Baran as he is known there), enough.  He was wonderfully charming and accommodating to our ""american-ness"". He patiently lead us through the menu and engaged in entertaining, witty conversation Now for our food.  OUR FOOD.  Every bite was amazing!   Our party had everything from the ""summerly radishes soup"" to my dish, ""Our Pfundskerl"" (meatball with asparagus and noodles)   Everything was exceptional.  Each mouthwatering dish was flavorful and melted in your mouthWe cannot speak highly enough of our experience at Das Dorf"
4,"A friend recommended that bistro so I had to try it out. They not only a wide variety of Galettes, they also have a nice selection of wines. My friend had a Galette with Gorgonzola and I had a Galette Begerre. The only bad thing was that some of the walnuts had to much of caramelized sugar but beside that it was very delicious and the perfect mix between savory and sweet.Highly recommended for good Galettes!"
4,"After many years come back to this well known place The prices still in the upper range makes the expectations grow :)The food still one of the best, fresh herbes, fresh fish, real Thai taste Excellent! I like to sit at the window, the big room inside  even with a lot of high style Thai decoration  does not make me feel comfortable."
4,"This place would have to be the highlight of our trip to Germany. The detail is amazing! I spent three hours there - would have spent three days if I had had the time! A tip: book a place online. You can print out a special timed ticket which gives priority entrance ahead of the queue, a great idea, and beats waiting! But you still pay only when entering the miniature world. Wow!"
3,"Haifisch Bar is such an archetype of a Hamburg harbour bar that it almost hurts to see its raw realness. Loads of dusty, mysterious memorabilia all over the place. Reminding you of the good old days when the rough sailors were there on shore leave for strong drinks, picking fights and the girls. The furniture and bar are very old-fashioned - but not in that trendy retro way, it just IS original. A bar, some stools, a few tables and that's it.The lady behind this bar is profesionally friendly and nothing like the big-mouthed trollop you'd expect. Drinks are free of any glamour so you'd get your plain Astra or Jever. Prost!I have also been there for a 2 funky fiestas thrown by a business friend for their clients. So apparently there was food involved for the media people, too. And guess what? It was home-style cooking à la Hamburg: a buffet consisting of meatballs, bread rolls with fish, fish cake and potato salad. And everybody liked it.. as spoilt as they may be. Amazing!Maybe some thought this place was especially set up for them as a big spectacle?! So it's definitely worth checking out even though it can get pretty touristy (No photography allowed!). But if you wish to experience the real Hamburg, please do go."
4,"Definitely a part of town you have to visit. It's not simply one of the stops on a tour of Hamburg. It should be a necessary stop if trying to get a feel for the city. It's bordering on one of the largest construction sites in Europe...the Hafencity. Once complete, the Speicherstadt itself will become even more vibrant. It will also help once the U4 subway line runs to the area. Worth coming to see just to walk around and thereafter grab a coffee somewhere. Near the water and best visited in the summer but just as good when it's cold and less people are out and about."
1,Delicious food!!!Funky atmosphere!!!The entire experience was ruined by the waiter attempting to flirt with my boyfriend the whole time!!!
4,Delicious food & fantastic service! Perfect place to eat with a baby too as the service is excellent and accommodating for all needs.
2,"Was there the other day for a drink on a Friday night. Place was packed and we waited that the door for the hostess to get to us (there were still two other tables in front of my buddy and me). While listening to the conversation of those guests we inevitably noticed that the restaurant was full and only waiting for bar seats were still free... which was fine with us as we wanted to have drinks only anyways! Ended up in front of the hostess and she said to us, 'We do not have tables anymore, unless you have a reservations!'. I was a bit stunned by that 'welcome' as it was not really what I expected and said that bar seats would be fine! Her face immediately cleared up and she was visually relieved and we were lead to the bar. Place was indeed packed, so def great atmosphere with good music (a little too loud as we need to shout...) and service at the bar was fast and pleasant. I must agree though with other comments that prices are quite high... 4 drinks (2 bottle beers and two alcohol free beers) total bill of 25 EUR I think the most expensive beer I so far had in Hamburg! Anyways am sure that things will get smoother sooner or later, am not sure though prices gonna become more moderate. Will give it another try sometime on one of my next visits."
4,"One of the best steakhouses I've been to  and certainly the best I've been to in Hamburg.I had a Carpaccio with pumpkin pesto, rucola and parmesan as a starter, a 200g (ladies cut) filet as the main course with a side of green beans and bacon. For dessert, a plate of chocolate mousse and brownies, garnished with red fruits.A two-person meal dealt damage of about 150 euros. Considering how much I enjoyed my food, not a large price to pay. Certainly not a cheap restaurant (the starters alone are close to 20 euros a plate, the 200g filet was 35 euros, the dessert 12) but well suited for a once-in-a-while indulgence.Recommended for those who like meat and aren't afraid to get creative with their eating."
4,"Beautiful, spacious restaurant in the basement of Hamburg's historic city hall building. Unlike most city hall restaurants in Germany, this one is relatively fancy with excellent service and great food and drinks. Compared to other restaurants of its class in Hamburg it is downright cheap. The food is mostly modern interpretations of traditional Hamburg and North German dishes. Great place to take a date!"
4,Service was amazing! Atmosphere was also great. I got bacon cheeseburger on a dark bun and sweet potato fries. The texture and flavors were well balanced and very satisfying. The food was also presented beautifully. I plan on returning soon!
3,"Came here to Hamburg to visit the sites but it was raining and a bit cold so we decided get some lunch and stay out of the rain.  We took a taxi to the  place and it was fully packed when we arrived around noon with no available seats so we decided to go walk around the shopping district and come back later.  We came back about 45 mins later and there was a couple empty tables so we decided to order.  I decided to get the lunch special for €10 which included a burger, fries and with a drink or milkshake.  My burger came out hot and juicy with lettuce, tomato and cheese with BBQ sauce and mayo all on a brioche bun.  There was Hellman's mayo and ketchup along with Cholula hot sauce on the table.   My fries were very hot and crisp so I know they just came out the fryer.  I decided on a bottle of Coca Cola rather than the milkshake.  My lunch was excellent in all.  I thoroughly enjoyed my burger.  Maybe the only thing missing would be some grilled onions and pickles.  This restaurant has no parking area along with most places here.  The place is in a modern building and close to a shopping district.   At least I can now say I had a Hamburg in Hamburg.  Yea I'm corny like that."
2,"The food was only mediocre and although the staff was friendly, it was clear most of them were inexperienced. We ordered a lot and shared the dishes:Rump steak (medium rare): this steak was undercooked (although I preferred it that way), it wasn't actually medium rare, but it was pretty good.Rib eye steak (medium rare): this steak was pretty tasteless.Caesar salad: had a weird flavor going on. Wasn't traditional caesar salad (in a bad way).Potato Wasabi Puree: interesting, but the charred avocado on top didn't do much.Grilled white asparagus: these were pretty good. Had a nice asian flavor.Marinated beefsashimi: this was mostly raw beef with a sear on the outside. There was some sort of fruit the same color as the meat, which was a surprise to bite into. This was interesting.Sashimi from loupnde mer (with grilled watermelon and san deniele ham): this wasn't so great. Didn't really work as a dish.Southern apple tuna roll (with tunasashimi, granny smith apple, avocado, basil, and soy caramel): this was pretty good. Interesting, but you couldn't really taste the apple, it might as well have been cucumber.Salmon Hand Roll: this was okay. It had a lot of mayo and not so much salmon.California Roll: decent. Nothing special.Chicken Skewer Yakitori: drenched in syrup, but the onions and chicken were okay. Wouldn't go back again, but it wasn't terrible."
2,"Here is a steakhouse that looks great, has outstanding servers and a friendly happy vibe. But the food tastes pushed... The premium T bone was a delicious steak that was really tender. And, it was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request. The issue? 4! Count them--four 6 inch sprigs of fresh Rosemary on the hot plate under the steak overwhelming it with herby fumes! 1 would have sufficed! Four is enough to offend and halt an angry Water Buffalo at full waddle.Then the green beans were cooked squishy and had heavy butter. What happened to steaming so there is still a firm bite? And the steak sauce was an odd concoction of tomato cocktail sauce with onions??? For my premium steak? A horseradish Mayo with steak drippings would have been more interesting for a house steak sauce...The fries? Perfect.The 500g T bone (porterhouse actually with giant filet lobe) was a generous portion.The server crew oozed warm hospitality--bravo. The kitchen crew looked depressed. Maybe they knew that I would not enjoy my steak"
0,We have waited for one hour to finally get our food :( They gave too many excuses. The food is also NOT satisfied!
4,"Perfect snack for a night out on the Reeperbahn. Came here late on a Saturday night and there was a line of hungry club-goers, and a nice man tending the shop solo that quickly filled all our orders. One a the best burgers I've had, and cheep too!"
0,"Not the best place at all. Australian restaurant with german menus. The ads and the website gave uncompleted info about the food. We went for the chicken wings, but they refuse to give with the excuse we need to book table in advance (information nowhere to find). We asked for kangaroo stake, but they did not even had. I saw ad inside for meet cake, but they sayd its just old ad. In the end i decided to have bison burger, but they mixed up the order. So. This place is no go ever again for all of us."
4,"Since my visit in 2013, I've been telling everyone I know to go here who will be in Hamburg. (I'm a little surprised/ashamed I didn't write a review yet...)This place is incredible. It's several stories of a warehouse that's been converted into an aptly-named miniature wonderland. The attention to detail into every aspect of this space is simply astounding. It perfectly encapsulates what happens when smart, whimsical people set their minds to building amazing, tiny things :)Kids probably love it, too, but knowing my nephew we would probably never make it past the first floor-- it's that big and engrossing. I found the control center the most fascinating part, but others in my group liked the airport-- planes ""took off"", ""landed"", taxied and did it all over again on a schedule that was tracked in real time on a screen. Several places seem pretty darned accurately modeled in terms of what a place actually looks like; others have taken a wee bit of poetic license to make it fit within the warehouse (for example, the USA section represents Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, and several other places that look as if they're right next to each other, when that is not exactly how it goes in the US). There's even a model of Hamburg. I won't spoil the wonder of visiting for yourself with any more details about what you'll see-- just plan to spend at least a few hours here to fully appreciate the splendor."
3,Lieblings is located close to Reeperbahn. It has a variety of ice cream flavors. The ones I tried were all really good. Great place to stop by when visiting St. Pauli.
1,Service is good after a little waiting time you get seated! Burgers don't take long. Ordered a rare farmers burger but got a burger grilled well done. After asking if that's the rare burger they just said sorry this happens when it's busy. That's it...Beer is alright. Sides are good.
1,"OK, there is definately better sushi in this world than this place. I used to go to the Sushi Circle in Frankfurt, where there wasn't an all-you-can-eat option, and the cuts of fish were better and the selection significantly better. Very long waiting times when the all-you-can-eat special is on offer and as already written, extremely tight seating. I believe if you want to save money, the place to go, but do you really want to ""save money"" when eating sushi (it's RAW fish)? I rather eat ""Fischstäbchen"" from the microwave and save up cash for a really good sushi restaurant once in a while."
4,"Eiskantine, I am going to need new jeans soon because of you if I keep coming here so frequently.I have come here way too often in the last 2 months and every time is even better than the last. All of the flavours are absolutely delicious. An always changing collection of unique ice creams and sorbets."
3,As a british man Indian curries are extremely important to us as they are our nation's favourite.  The service was polite and authentic as was the choice of two Indian beers. My wife chose a wine and it was very nice which is rare in a curry house and we shared the 2 person tandoori platter. It was a lot of food but very very nice.
3,"The burger is simply amazing and service keep improving over time.I would recommend Dulf's as a great place to have a burger with friends, but be aware that they do not take reservation over phone."
4,"We had breakfast here, yesterday, and we loved it. Not knowing that it is better to make a reservation, we got lucky after a short wait: They had a table for us! The coffee was the most delicious coffee we ever had and the breakfast absolutely marvelous. I recommend the power bowl!I saw a recommendation here, suggesting that Americans wouldn't be served here, that is b.s.! If tables are empty, that just means someone made a reservation and will be seated there, soon. Our waitress was nice and friendly, the service prompt, we have no complaints. Americans are always very welcome in any German place, since they are known to give great tips. We are from Texas, didn't have any problems, ever!"
4,I love Starbucks so much! This one has one of the best views I've ever seen and free Wi-Fi (log out and in again every 2 hours). Will def come back for more ice chai tea latte
2,"It's ok (for a Vietnamese). Good selection, nice ambience and a place you can take your friends to for Vietnamese food. The food is average I would say but value isn't that great. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in town."
3,"Nice museum with art from the 16th century and onwards. Logically displayed so it was easy to follow how art forms has developed through different eras. Nice to look at paintings from Degas, Monet, Renoir, Picasso  to modern artists. Close to Hauptbahnhof so easy to get to."
4,"Das Restaurant is einfach genial! Sehr schön, wirklich leckeres Essen mit einer super Präsentation, und vor allem echt nette Bedinung!! Wir waren zur viert, zwie hatten nur ein Hauptgericht bestellt und die zwei andere Hauptgericht+Vorspeisen. Die Kellner sind einfach mit zwei extra Mini-Vorspeisen angekommen, damit die zwei mit Vorspeisen nicht allein essen. Das war einfach Klasse. Die Preise sind ein bisschen höher als normal. Wobei ist es nicht übertrieben für die Qualität vom Essen und vom Service! (ca. 18-25eur für ein Hauptgericht). Dieses Lokal ist wirklich zu emfehlen!"
4,"Great coffee! So many different variations, and a small selection of cakes. Very small coffee shop so it can get crowded but they also have tables and chairs outside."
3,"Update:I'm here without dogs and babies, so my experience is different from other negative reviews I've read. I can see the appeal of this place: it lies in its well-designed, cozy, country-style atmosphere, in its warmth. December 29, 2012Darn! Nothing on their Facebook page says they would be closed for Christmas. :("
3,"Full on a tuesday evening!We just had a quick beer there.The bar is really laidback, cool. there are tables outside and inside.Its around 5 mins away by foot from the busy schulterblatt, in a very quite street.There are two rooms: smoking and non smoking.Although i didnt eat, the people sitting on the table next to me had ordered a burger. I was drooling over it. it looked so delicious! (costs 7EUR60, with salad and fries on the side and free ketchup!) next time im there, im definitely having it!"
4,"This is a MUST for anyone visiting Hamburg!The Speicherstadt is the largest warehouse district in the world, it's right by the harbour and the buildings are all built along various canals. Wares used to be brought here straight from the large ships and stored in the warehouses. There's still some trade going on here obviously, but there are also many quirky and interesting places to visit, including several museums and some renouned restaurants.This district was built in the late 1800s and rests on a timber foundation. If you stay long enough to catch dusk, it's simply gorgeous to wander around on the plethora of small bridges and canals. Well-placed lighting bathes the buildings and waterways in beautiful light.It's a really photogenic district with so many museums, restaurants and other interesting places, it might be worth just wandering around and seeing what you can discover."
3,It's close to the wonderland. After visiting that I just searched restaurant and choose ti breizh. It's cheaper and more delicious than i imagine. But the passion juice is too sweet.，
3,Delicious food!!! Not so much vegetarian options but I loved my salad. Also good price. Friendly staff.
0,"Save your €26.50 and head to a real restaurant.  This one is a joke for service and value for money. Eaten in many places like this all over the world, and  don't expect much.  Buffet is extremely basic for the money, pre cooked food was with cheap ingredients and small choice.  ""Live Cooking"" is ok, although hygiene of the food is far from ok.  Flies buzzing around the mounds of uncooked meat and fish and the cook didn't seem to know what he was doing.  The very small selection Sushi was awful, cheap and dried out.  The tiramisu was a mushy mess left in the bowl, the scraps from others desert helpings.  Asked the head waiter if they had a fresh tiramisu, who did get a fresh one, but proceeded to moan at his customer that normally you need to finish off the scraps before they can change, or their boss gets angry... All in all, save your disappointment and keep on walking..."
2,"When XING handed out coupons for free coffee drinks at the new Campus Suite, I was glad to give the place a test-run. Though I can't say I'm a big coffee shop sitter anymore - at least not at big, impersonal chain-type places - I figured it was worth a try.The jury's in: The new place isho-hum. Reminds me of any chain-type coffeeshop in any college town in the states. The woman behind the counter was nice, and I certainly prefer to support a student-run place over Starbuck$, but that's about it. The coffee was fine, but a bit cold and not strong enough. Mine at home is much better, as is the espresso at 'Delikatessen des Meeres' in the Colonnaden (my tip for great coffee and a great lunch, too). How about a new idea for a change?"
2,"I know we have the French Laundry in California and are terribly spoiled, but the food at this restaurant was a 4.  The service started out great and deteriorated to unacceptable over the evening, so I would put that at a 3.  When they served one of our party the wrong dessert, instead of apologizing and offering to serve the correct dessert, she said ""the other dessert is basically the same, just black currant vs strawberry.""  what the heck?!  we said, that was fine, that they could make up the mistake on our petit fors that we were getting to go (because we were too full).  They gave us the petit fors to go, but did not include anything extra.  We paid for accompany wine and no dessert wine was served.  They did not offer coffee or any other options at the end of the meal.  We have received expected service at other restaurants in Germany, so I don't understand.  $511 euros for a dinner should get exceptional service.  Boo to the Haerlin!"
3,"This place is crazy. So many details and special effects. If you like trains, building stuff, or if you have a kid this is the place. It was a little to crowded for me. Many kids and parents. They have minimiced citys over the world and they make it possible for you to see theese in daylight but also at night. This place is big so make sure you have time to go trough all rooms. They serve food and theres toilets. Costs 16 euro per person in entrence fee for adults. There are parkingspots near and a parking house."
3,"Scrumptious Iranian food, generous portions, cozy relaxed atmosphere and open late. My lamb chops were expertly seared, tender and nicely seasoned. The sampler was outstanding as well. Still dreaming about that meal!"
4,Very good service and excellent foos!
4,"Finally ended up going here after planning to do so for a while. Not always in the Brasserie mood but this time it fit perfectly. Really enjoyed Carls. I personally like the decor and loved the booth we sat in....we had a two-top. Had a partial view of the harbor but also had the table ""to ourselves"" which we really enjoyed. Not going to go into detail as many others have but service was top-notch from start to finish. Absolutely no complaints in this regard. Very professional and attentive. The food was also great. We had some oysters, a starter soup, the noodles with truffles and the Boeuf bourguignon. For dessert we shared the chocolate dessert with bananas and mango. Really enjoyed everything from start to finish. We skipped the flat-rate water for a normal bottle of still water. Not much more expensive to be honest unless you come thirsty. The wine was a bit off (Salvay Spätburgunder) but this was simply because of our taste. Wasn't bad but I was expecting something different....not the restaurants fault in any way. Finally, as others have mentioned, the toilets are really nicely done as well. I even snuck into the private room downstairs (with it's own bar...have to remember that for my next company event) to check out the IWC event going on....considering I'm a watch buff. Highly recommend Carls if you like Brasserie food. Don't be put off by the Hafencity surrounding. Only the philharmonie is to be completed. Everything else around the building Carls is in is complete. Will be great place to eat next summer as well once the weather is good again...nice large outdoor area."
3,"I have to be honest, this location is the main and probably only Vapiano's I really frequent in Hamburg.  For some reason, I do not stand alone when I say this is the most popular location, as it is not just the food that brings people here, but strangely enough, it is also the most social of locations. On most typical nights, you are crammed onto tables with strangers eating cheek to cheek, elbow to elbow. I mean, at times, we even have to battle it out to hang our purses, coats, scarfs, etc on the hooks that are just not enough to go around.  And do not even try to set your jacket or bag on a chair to store it, thinking that it will deter people away from sitting next to you.  NOPE, major failed plan.  This is Germany, they simply say, ""Ist hier Frei?"" essentially translated into, ""No human being is occupying this chair right? Ok, then please remove your personal belongings so I can plant my hungry butt down.""  Yep, Vapiano's is a hustle.  Hustle to get a tray, get in line, get your order in, get a drink, or stand in a separate area for alcohol, and then good luck getting back in line for dessert later.  Even with all this fuss, we all still go there... The food is not of the highest quality, but it is tasty and moderately priced maybe even considered cheap to the non student crowd, and the atmosphere is somehow posh-casual.  It is kinda like the Starbuck's of Italian Pizzeria food chains, not just in Hamburg, but even when I was in New York City, it is always a similar story and routine.  Local Tip: Go here on Thursday night. For some reason, that is ""the night"" at Vapiano's on Hallerstrasse.  For some reason, people like to be seen here on that night.  I guess it is because the week is almost over and people want to get ready for the weekend, so they come for cocktails, since it has decent food, and is near the train stop, it can bring people living in the areas of Harvesthude, Eppendorf, Rotterbaum, and even Mitte together simply because it is off the U1 Train.My favorite salad is the steak one with shrimp, a bit of surf & turf.  As far as pasta, I love the curly noodles one that has a bit of a spicy beef tip/tenderloin with mushrooms and rucola, and a creamy tomato sauce, yummy.  To drink, if I am not drinking my liquid antioxidant of choice, Red Wine (good for the blood!), then I take usually an Orangina, since it has a cute genie like bottle and a fresh citrus taste to it that goes lightly with any meal you choose, whether soup, salad, pizza or pasta."
3,"It is amusing to travel from America to Hamburg to get a hamburger made with American beef in a somewhat Americanized restaurant, but the results are anything but amusing. The burger had the highest beef to bread ratio I have seen. I usually order burgers medium to be safe, but luckily the waitress pointed out this would be a mistake here and they shouldn't be cooked past medium rare.The filthy harry was good enough that I couldn't help but order it each time I came here. Fries are also tasty. The burger is on the expensive side, but for the quality and quantity that you receive it is reasonable. Also it was a bit of a kick to see Anchor Steam beer on the menu."
4,"Awesome bar! The food is very nice and very affordable. The space is a little crammed, but it adds to the charm and the staff (and indeed he patrons) were very nice nice"
3,Excellent pizza and lunch special combination! I ordered the vegitarian pizza and it was absolutely delicious and only 4euro. I was really suprized with the quality and the size of the pizza. The service was super quick too!
4,"One of my 'locals' anytime of the year. As a non-meat eater, I can't comment on the 'Haxe' or even the fish, but the appetizers are great, and never cease to satisfy. With a bottle of retsina and an ouzo or two, a meal at Nostalgia is always worthwhile."
4,Exquisite service! Super interior. Love their salted popcorn as nice welcome. Had sushi at this place and loved it! Also tried their sweet potato fries with guac but the guac was a bit too watery for my taste. All in all a really nice place to stop by after shopping. Thumbs up for the great staff!
3,"Our first choice of restaurant was fully booked (we'd forgotten to reserve a table), and the host there recommended this place near by.    we had a decent pizza (quite spicy) and a pasta.  The pasta seemed slightly undercooked (not quite al-dente yet).  This would normally cause me to rate them at 3 stars, but they had a nice wine (Brunello di Montalcino) for a decent price, which bumps them back up to 3 1/2, so I will be generous and give four."
3,"Love this place especially during spring, drinks are yummy n strong, wide variety.music sometimes is too loud to talk n the toilets a bit smelly."
4,When did you last sit on a stove while conversing with someone on a washing machine? Exactly.
2,"Schöne Location und auch nette Mitarbeiter. Die Preise allerdings sind frech - viel zu teuer, für das, was man bekommt, gerade im Bereich der Kuchen und Torten."
4,"This is it. One if the most authentic asian restaurants in all of Hamburg. Amazing food for a fair price, hidden away in Hamburg Jenfeld - really of the grid. But don't let that stop you from treating yourself to the most authentic and delicious vietnamese food you'll ever get this far away from Hanoi. And boy are you in for a treat. The food is amazing! Flavourful with a home cooked vibe to the dishes, served with fresh and fragrant herbs, spicy chilies and refreshing drinks. Satisfaction guaranteed! The service is efficient, friendly and accommodating. I once turned up with a friend of mine minutes after closing and they still served us and where so nice to us, even though we stalled their much deserved closing time. Thank you once again! The decor used to be typical to Asian Street Food restaurants (very basic) but they changed all that and redid the restaurant. Purists, regulars and people in the know may shrug off the redesign but I think its great. Hopefully people whom are not accustomed to asian Street Food won't be dissuaded by the backroom flair any longer. The little trip to Jenfeld is time well spent. As a tip, get there on a saturday or sunday morning. The place is bursting with people from all walks of life. Asian families dressed to the nines, groups of young people looking a little hung over from last night, old wrinkly asians all busy chatting away and most likely me, taking the whole scenery in, slurping my jumbo Pho and just being content. I'll see you there!"
4,"Staff was friendly, explained all the items, and was a lot of fun to talk to. Everything we we tried was very good. Good music for the vibe too"
3,"The burritos are wonderfully juicy, which makes them hopeless to eat, but you won't care. You'll be on the most wonderful journey exploring that burrito, one bite at a time, going deeper and deeper into a food-haze. Next stop: sweat pants city. I had the pulled-beef (soup?) with... um, everything.I do have some (minor) criticism:Burritos are made in front of your eyes, yet once they're done they are taken away for heating -- forever. Why? It's not even that hot once you get it.I'm also not a fan of the ambiance. I get it; ""it's a fast food place, it should look like it"". I'm not sure what it is, I think it might be the florescent lights in one end combined with the dark-ish-ness in the other; it makes my brain confused. I want the same warm fuzzy feeling that burrito gives to be confirmed by my eyes.Not that I'll be looking or even be aware once I'm halfway done. But still.This is the closest to ""Californian cooking"" I've experienced since my half year living there; a time where eating was one big blur, and I can't remember any particular burrito. But I do remember the feeling. It's the feeling of Qrito."
4,"First time having Curry Worst, my brother has had it many times and we both thought it was fantastic."
4,"I have definitely reviewed the Hafenbahnhof before. But since Qype doesn't remember, here I go again! It feels like miles away although certain people may argue it's not, it is. But don't let that put you off. Great views of the docks out of the windows whilst you sip a cold astra and watch Hamburg's very own Ricky Kings play. It's all good."
4,"Great spot for dim sum in Hamburg! Tried lots of different dishes and enjoyed them all. Tasty and authentic Chinese food in the heart of Hamburg close to the Hauptbahnhof. Some of the food can take a while but it's worth the wait! FYI - They don't take reservations, so you just have to try your luck."
4,Schnitzel was very tender and buttery. Falafel was full a flavor   Service was prompt and friendly
3,I had a very good dinner but because I arrived alone on Valentine's Day without a reservation I had to sit at the bar which I don't recommend unless you are very tall. It was uncomfortable with legs dangling for so long otherwise dinner of rib eye with shallot potatoes and spinach was excellent and they pour a fair sized glass of wine.
4,"Very flavorful kebab and rice! The soultani is well cooked, overall well done but still very moist. Served with mint and onions, as well as flatbread. Very reasonably priced about 14.50 euros for soultani, about 2.80 for each drink. Served very fast! Good Persian music playing in the background and elegantly decorated."
4,"I was on a free walking tour of Hamburg, and was brought to this area. And that's what it is. An area of old warehouses, many of which played a key role in the economic development of this city and country.The place is really photogenic. I was surprised at how many photos I wanted to take. The network of canals flowing between the warehouses create some wonderful photo ops, and it was also interesting to learn about the history of the buildings. I would recommend taking one of the free walking tours for this reason.The Miniatur Wunderland is in the area, so that's another reason to check it out. See my review of that for more info!"
2,"I found this lovely little place by posting a question on the Yelp Hamburg page as I was looking for somewhere that did a high tea sort of spread in Germany.We travelled for over an hour and it took a while to find the place but I was so glad we made the effort.We arrived mid morning and as we were really hungry we got tea, breakfast and I had a scone. The breakfast itself was something I'm not used to simply because of the combination of food that we got. I did find it to be the norm in Germany though with slight variations, the plate had fruit, a warm hard boiled egg, some jam, fresh tomato and a very crunchy but yummy roll. We had English breakfast tea which was tasty. I'm not a cream person so I only had jam on my scone but it was nice.The building itself was old and very old fashioned with lots of pictures of the queen. Had a very British feel and it was lovely. Staff although friendly were very hard to find when you wanted them and I had to go looking when I wanted to order scones and when I wanted to pay.I will definitely go back next time I'm in Hamburg as we had a very enjoyable day.Had I not had to chase staff it would have got 4 stars for sure and I would still recommend this place if you want something old fashioned with a bit of charm and an English feel."
2,"Simple beach joint. Relatively young crowd. The prices are ok, considering they really fill your white wine glass. A bit too uptight with the timing of the orders. We wanted to order fries but had to wait 8 minutes because they don't accept the order earlier than 12:30... nice and relaxing atmosphere. Just too bad the waitresses ignored us when we tried ordering drinks. The wines are ok-ish... waited too long for fries... overall we give it 3*..."
4,"I came here on a recommendation by a friend that this was the best coffee in townI now wholeheartedly agree! The latte was so excellent, it made a Starbucks creation seem like a gas station cup of joe in comparison. Moreover, the chocolate chip cookie was the closest I've had to American style in Germany (although heating it up a tad wouldn't have hurt.) It's a small and cozy place, and rather quiet, which had a drawback: I had the unfortunate experience of encountering elderly clientele there who were reading newspapers and thus thought it was perfectly appropriate to ask fellow coffee drinkers to remain silent due to this. I can only hope they had gotten lost on their way to the library. Nevertheless, I can't blame the shop! A+ coffee here, even if just for a delicious to-go cup."
3,"This is a nice restaurant/bar in Barmbek. As far as I know it's the only nice one ;)Very close to the Museum der Arbeit (Museum of Work), so you can get some culture before the booze and the food. Which, by the way, is quite good here. But also quite expensive. Nevertheless the place is always crowded in the evening, so make sure you come early.Biggest downside: If you're sitting outside the noise of the airplanes is really annoying."
4,Amazing food made fresh. The aroma alone from the outside is enough to attract people to this restaurant. That's how my wife and I ended up here and did not regret it. I'll come back again for sure.
4,"Good quality and quantity, best sea food in town. But if you go there during busy hour you may need to wait for a while or need reservation"
4,I really love this place so much! Not only is the food really fresh and well done but also very creative.I had their large mushroom bowl with silk tofu and holy moly! As a person with Vietnamese background I can tell you that this dish was very refreshing and new for me! Service has been amazing and the interior is what I consider very contemporary for vietnamese restuarants: atmospheric and aspiring to re-create the streetfood vibe in Vietnam.
3,"I really enjoyed this, geeky as it may be. There's zero hype, and not much education happening. Basically, you're walking on your own through a good portion of a real submarine, free to poke and prod. If that appeals to you, have at it! But take it from me, watch your head. The doors are low at the top, and high at the bottom, and generally have pipes just where you want to stand up after passing through. (Probably not a good outing for a first date.)"
2,"We've enjoyed our diner at the Parlament. The building is very spacious and has a nice and fresh ambiance. Diner was nice, not excellent or very special, but for us - tourists on the go - it was ok. We sat down pretty early (5:15 pm) and could be seated right away. Guests who arrived later had to wait al little while, but in a crowded city like Hamburg, that is something you have to take in to account."
3,"I have to admit, I was intrigued by the menu featuring a salad with carmel corn. Salad was great and Iberian pork fabulous. Service was also very good. Enjoyed the meal."
2,"Das neue Innen-Design ist cool und modern, ähnelt stark Starbucks. Leider gibt es hier nicht mehr die hintere Sitzecke, in der man sich etwas zurückgezogener unterhalten konnte. Sehr schön finde ich immer die Blumen-Arrangements auf den Tischen! Der Lärmpegel ist wie eh und jeh sehr laut.  Die verschiedenen Kaffee-Spezialitäten (Caramellj, Vanilla Latte etc.) schmecken für mich alle gleich, dafür sind die Baguettes und Surf-Cup-Nudeln sehr lecker!  Für einen kleinen Zwischenstopp zum Füße ausruhen eine gute Wahl mitten in der City."
3,"Finally a cosy café in Hamburg-Wandsbek! Manyl small rooms with vintage couches. Perfect for breakfast/bruch with friends. Larger brunch buffet on Sunday. Crowded on sunday, so I recommend to reserve a table. Perfect if you bring young kids, because they have a room with some games. One disadvantage is there is no diaper changing table at the ladies."
4,"Wow, tolles Essen! Sehr interessante Einrichtung. Nette Bedienung. Wir sind rundum glücklich :) Mittagstisch um die 10EUR und wahnsinns gute Qualität!"
3,"What can I say about Loving Hut-Vegan?? First of all I am not a Vegan by any means but I followed some co-workers the other day for lunch and we ended up here. It is a nice, small location with a busy lunch crowd. When we arrived the place was fully packed and we had to wait about 5 minutes before we could be seated. Once we were seated it took a good 10-15 minutes before the waiter finally came over.I ordered the Thai Curry which was pretty good. For around 7€ I got the main dish plus a starter of my choice. I choose the spring rolls which were also tasty. Overall the food was pretty good, nothing to remember though. The service is what took this from a 5 star to a 4 star. There seemed to be only the 1 server and a lady who only cleaned the tables.I would probably come back though which is a good thing."
3,"This place is massive, busy and awesome. I've not really seen anything like it before. Certainly not in Australia! I decided to get what everyone else was having, doner kebab meat, chips and all the trimmings (salad, cabbage two ways, onions etc). I couldn't finish it there was so much. Also came with Turkish bread and tea to finish. Am hoping to go there again before heading home."
4,Slowly becoming my Stammcafe in Eimsbüttel- the thing I like most about Zeitraum is that its not too full or loud- on the weekends the cafe will fill up but you can still grab a table and concentrate on whatever book or newspaper you are reading. There are a lot of magazines and newspapers up near the front and on the way out you can grab a DVD two doors down from Filmraum (they must be run by the same folks). Drinks are good (very nice green tea and rooibos combinations) and prices are fair- I have not tried the food or the brunch yet but it looks like your standard Hamburg cafe menu and is mostly (if not all) organic so plus one there. This place would be really cool to rent out for a birthday party- I might just have to do that
3,"Chouette endroit en effet, la rue est jolie, une clientèle brassée et ma foi sympathique, service gentil, bons cocktails quand le barman est là et bonne surprise chaque fois : les prix sont très modérés. Mon chouchou : les pizzas sont excellentes, vous savez, celles avec des ingrédients frais et à pate fine. C'est simple, je ne mange jamais de pizza en dehors de chez moi, exception faite pour Gloria. Ce soir sur la carte, une pizza chèvre miel et poire, un délice! Sinon la Rucola Parma Schinken, très bonne aussi. Tables en terrasse toujours bondées à partir de 15 degrés ;-) c'est typique de Hambourg! De toutes façons, on est mieux assis à l'intérieur."
4,Best museum I have been to! Super cool and such an accurate architectural design. I loved the airport and runway design as I just love flights! Everyone will definitely love this. Worth every penny
4,Awesome! Wonderful food and Benny was a great server to us. So hospitable and down to earth Would come back here often.
4,"This is the most beautiful and largest coffee shop I found in Hamburg. Excellent views of the canal. Huge space with plenty of areas to relax. Modern design. And of course....the coffee! Excellent. Third wave. They have Chemex, Aeropress, Syphon etc.... And free wifi."
4,"I finally made it to Zipang. The 35 minutes waiting outside in the cold were totally worth it. We started out with the gyoza, which unlike other places was not deep fried, hence the real deal. The ramen were absolutely delicious and the eismochi was to die for, specially the mango one!! Service was very friendly and quick. Will be back many times."
4,"This is a bloody big bridge. Looks great from a 10 euro boat trip, and you can probably see it even more cheaply if you take the ferry instead. Watching panamax container ships sail under here is awe-inspiring!"
4,"Who would've thought a place named the bird actually is well known for its burgers and who would've thought that I actually could find one of the best burgers I've had (and I've tried a lot) in Hamburg? Ok maybe I should've seen that one coming. So my friend tells me about this great burger spot and while I agree to go I'm thinking how good could this burger actually be, I guess this is a perfect example of what they say about not having expectations because I absolutely loved it! When we first arrived there was no seating inside except for the bar and that's where we sat, First of all they had ""angry hour"" which had all kinds of specials but being that it was a Sunday night I didn't think they would honor it but they were willing to, the one that caught my eye was the buy one tap beer and get one free per person at the bar, it was set to be over at 20:00 and it was 19:45 and the bartender told me that if I could finish my first beer by 20:00 that I could have the other one free, while I didn't go through with it, it was still nice that they would do it, now on to the burger, it comes with fries and they have many different kinds, you can also make your own burger if you wish, the burger came with fries and was huge and impossible to eat without getting some all over your hands but those are the best ones right? I finished the burger but it was no easy task, good quality good prices also"
4,"This is a Part of Hamburg anyone should have seen. Besides Dungeon, Miniatur Wunderland and a Coffee Shop there is a lot to see. Use the possibility of a Barkassenfahrt in order to complete the impression of this old part of the habour."
3,"This place has potential. Their service is slow, but the food is pretty good. The vegan pizzas are tasty. I think they need to work out the kinks in their delivery times, and they can be great."
4,"My absolute favorite place to spend a leisurely Sunday morning meal. Eating fresh fruit, quark, reading a magazine, and listening to the conversations of others is all part of the appeal of Cafe Zeitraum. It's like being served in a friend's comfortable living room."
4,"By reputation it's the best Italian restaurant in Hamburg. I have to agree. Great food, good service, feels authentic and costs an arm and a leg. Looks a bit ropey, and is nestled between all the working girls of Davidstrasse. Apparently it's been here for many decades, long may it continue.Book early if you want to go on the weekend."
4,"Fresh, high quality seafood.  Intimate sitting for 30 fills the restaurant. Proprietor hands on, serves as host and translator. Backyard party atmosphere, expect to relax and enjoy for hours as late arrivers are served to catch up on the set 4 course meal. Vegetarian service also offered. Guitarist adds to atmosphere. Generous host served special shots as we joined in watching Germany win the FIFA WC! Arriba!"
3,Went here for a business dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I had read many of the good reviews on here and wasn't expecting much. Thankfully I walked out happy. It's a really nice room and a good place for business or private meals. Service was polite and very professional. The menu is higher-end than most places on or near the Lange Reihe. We were quite happy with both our appetisers and main courses and had a great bottle of wine to go with it.....a recombination from the waiter. I'll definitely be back here when entertaining out of town business guests. I also would come with my wife for a romantic dinner. A really solid place which has established itself over the years and is well frequented. I highly recommend reserving a table if you do come.
3,"Central Park is open!cozy nice placeA beach club in the middle of schanze! It's close to home, so i guess i'd be spending a lot of saturday and sunday afternoons there!"
3,"The Block House in the Gänsemarkt isn't much to look at, especially from the outside, but the steaks are first class. A 250g rump or rib-eye will set you back around EUR17-EUR25, but that comes with a good-sized starter salad and a choice of chips (fries) or baked potato. One point to note is that a medium-rare is actually quite rare.. So, my friends had the steak, which apparently was wonderful, but I had the cheeseburger. EUR8.50 for a 200g burger with fries and coleslaw. The only complaint I have about the burger was that they didn't give me a choice of cheese, but otherwise it was great. Probably the best burger I've had outside the USA - however, it was my first burger in Germany.."
3,"We totally love the ambiance of the place! The start of service was fast and we did not wait very long for the food to be served. The food itself is very good! All of us have nothing to complain about our respective orders. The price is slightly higher to what we normally spend on an ordinary weekend with friends, however, it is justifiable!! End of service is, sadly, very slow. Originally, we wanted to order desserts and drinks as we wanted to stay longer... But after waiting and waiting and waiting for how long, we decided to just get the bills versus ordering anew. They have no problem with ""seperate"" bills & just need to request for it. I wanted to give them 4.5 rate, but as there is no 0.5 they ended up at 4. We will definitely go back!!"
3,An unusual style with a surprise menu. Just tell them what you really cannot eat and they will create something for you. quite a small place so booking is adviseable and at weekends absolutely necessary - its even possible to have a 2 or 3 week waiting list for a weekend booking.
3,"This place blows the Miniature World in Victoria, BC.  Respect to the people who created this place.  I noticed the awesome replicas of Las Vegas, New York, and Hamburg.  The model of the Hamburg Airport was pretty cool with planes departing and landing with day and night scenes.  A must stop for anyone visiting Hamburg."
3,"Nice cafe with a chilled vibe. Good coffee and good cake too. Unfortunately, one star deducted for my chocolate cake being on the dry side. May have been sitting out just a bit too long. Yet the mascarpone and cherry cake was great. We sat at the table right on the front window. Best spot in the cafe. I won't deduct a star as they were nice but it took forever to get out coffees which came way after we had the cake on the table. It was kind of full but I found it to have still taken quite long. Will be back and maybe next time it will be better."
3,"I'm from Italy, Rome and I can say that you can find good real italian food here. It might be the only or one of the few place in Hamburg.Good prices and italian speaking staff. Good if you want to have a real italian restaurant experience :)"
4,"Beautiful restaurant with excellent food.  I had a wonderful Tuna steak, home made fries and Noilly Prat sauce. So yummie!!!"
2,"On a 5 minute walk from the central station I found this Thai/Japanese restaurant. Small, but cosy. Restaurant entourage was sparse, not that many oriental stuff on the walls like you see in so many other Asian restaurants. Light is semi bright, you can actually see what your eating... (and who your talking to)The Japanese Asai beer on the menu was not available, had to revert to Kirin (also ok!).Tried Sashimi moriawase (mixed raw fish) for starters and a hot Thai beef curry as main course.It took a considerable amount of time to serve the starting course. The Sashimi was almost worth the wait, very tasty fish indeed. The surimi sticks could have been replaced by some other fresh fish (not so very original..).Only the wasabi was not as spicy and hot as I hoped for.The main course, curry beef, was exactly what I hoped for. Very hot and tasty! Albeit that the beef was a little overcooked and hence not that tender as it could have been. All in all a okay experience, but not so excellent as other reviewers indicated."
3,"In a one week business trip to Hamburg, I ate green lovers four times: once with a coworker, once as catering for a team meeting, and twice on my own. So I guess you could say I'm a fan of this place! And I'm clearly not the only fan, as there was a lunch line every time I visited (various times between noon and 1:30). But not to worry, the line moves quite fast and you'll be eating lunch before you know it.There are various salad and soup options available, or you can create a custom salad by pointing at ingredients at the counter. I quickly learned how to say the various parts of my order in German (mixed salad, egg, beans, corn, mushrooms, tomato, parmesan cheese, balsamic dressing), though most of the staff is pretty fluent in English. Visiting from SF where a custom lunch salad can easily cost $14, the prices here (around 5-8 euros for a custom salad, depending on what you put in it) seem very reasonable.There's some indoor seating but it's pretty packed at lunch, so you may want to plan to take your meal elsewhere. Though if you do manage to get a seat and are dining alone, not to worry, they have free wi-fi!Healthy, fresh, fast, and reasonably priced, this is a great antidote to the heaviness and grease typically associated with German food."
3,"Immense burgers here in Hamburg. Well worth the hunt to find the place (middle of a housing estate near St Pauli) for the reward of a super tasty patty.The muffin bun is a bit out of the ordinary, but it does work quite well. The chips are very good too, however the portion size is BARBARIC. have a look at the photo I posted. It's enormous.A great place and some really good craft beer options, again which is usually difficult to find in Hamburg."
4,"I love this place. Feels like a local spot. You get a really nice big plate of food for the money you spend. They are cash only and the girl that was working there at the time I went did not speak great English so I'm not sure if there is only two things offered here or if she was highly recommending the specials. I ordered the first thing on the chalk board (which is in my attached pictures) There is standing tables inside and a small spot next to the window, but the place to sit is outside at their communal tables. You order your food and drink and wait for the bell to ring, then you get your food inside. As an American I didn't know this, but I found it cute. You also bus your own dishes. For the price I paid, I didn't mind, and I wish I could come more often. They are all friendly and it is in a great location."
4,"A lot of Asian food in Germany is ""verdeutscht"" as is a significant amount of Asian food Americanized in the States. But coming from NY, you get such a wide array of pretty authentic Asian dishes. Bok avoids becoming like the throngs of fast food noodle joints in Hamburg and offers up some of the best Asian food, I think, you'll get in Hamburg."
3,"No, not like Duff Beer, it's Dulf's Burger! This joint serves up some amazing meat between buns utilizing a high tech ordering system that you will have to experience yourself. It'll be one of those times where you just wish every restaurant had this system that just makes things easier.I went big with my burger and ordered a special that had everything. I'm talking fried egg, avocado, etc. While it was damn delicious (see the cross section photo I posted), I sort of wish I just went with a straight up cheeseburger to bask in the glory of simple hamburger in Hamburg. The onion rings were good, but I think I would rather have went with the fries.I do think Burgerlich is better than Dulf's, but both are real good in their own ways. Check out both of them while you're in town!"
4,"Top of the line as far the currywurst I've had in Germany! Really nice guys in here - great service, and all cooked to order. The seating area outside is cool and has a decent patio heater to keep you warm. It's the perfect place for a quick snack before visiting the cinema down the road. Good stuff."
0,I met the owner upon arrival. What a schmuck. Treated me like he was Donald Trump or something. The place was smokey and unfriendly. Image-conscious wannabes. Stay away. You can get a beer anywhere.
3,"The name of this restaurant is fitting for my wife and I as we have ""desired"" to dine here for quite some time. Still we wonder sometimes what took us so long. If you've walked along Gertigstrasse at any point on a beautiful and warm evening you will notice that Deseo is one of two very popular tapas restaurants that are always seemingly buzzing. The vibe here is definitely more upscale than Arcada, just a half block down, and it's also reflected in the prices. The food here is very good though and very much worth a go.A reservation almost seems mandatory when dining on the weekend, and I would highly recommend it. Having made our reservation just a couple days prior, my wife and I studied and salivated over the menu, pretty much knowing exactly what we'd order once we arrived. We started off with complimentary bread, aoili and olives, which all of were great. We then proceeded to order the pimientos de Padrón, goat cheese with potatoes, chorizo, bacon-wrapped dates, prawns in garlic oil, and calamari in garlic oil. Every dish we had was savory and delicious; ones that I would definitely order again.Service was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice here as my wife and I indulged on our ""desired"" dishes and observed life passing from our window-bar seating."
3,Nice restaurant in a distinguished area of Hamburg center. Persian cuisine is well-known for its savoury dishes. Its worth the visit to enjoy the main course and their appetisers.
0,"We have been here for breakfast, but it was the first and last time! We had to wait a long time for our coffee and over 1h for a breakfast!! I had the vegan breakfast, because I was looking forward to the peanut butter. But it came without it. After asking they mentioned they don't have it anymore! Would have been nice to communicate it before because I was choosing the this breakfast because of the peanut butter! The quality of the food was okay, but nothing special and I had to peel the avocado and banana by myself. In the end the bill was 28€ which is not cheap for a breakfast and because of our issues I don't wanted to give a tip. And he just kept my 30€!!! I will never go there again!"
2,"Very disappointed. If you want to go for a brunch in Pauline at weekend, reservation is definitely necessary. The reservation list has always been long and it is recommended to reserve at least 4 days ahead. I've been looking forward to try their food because it seems so popular. However, you only get a 3-star hotel kind of breakfast for their 18.7€ buffet brunch menu. Totally a ruin of appetite and absolutely too expensive for such quality of food. The only good part of it is that at least you can make a nice Instagram style picture."
4,"This place is amazing for a rainy day! So much detail. So many great things to look at, so overwhelming but stick with it."
3,"Nice place to have good burger for lunch. Most of personnel speak English which is good. Prices are decent, also I would recommend to share fries with a friend, because I never manage to eat it myself. Only thing they're missing in my opinion is some Menu option (Burger+Fries+Drink), otherwise very nice place."
1,"I really tried to like it because of good comments I heard from friends. However, I can't say that my experience was great. I ordered the Avocado Burger, and so did two other colleagues. When the burgers arrived, they all looked very different (I know we ordered different buns) but overall, the patties and the presentation was way too off. Mine looked flat and uninspiring. The flavor was not that bad, but maybe not worth the high price."
4,A very nice restaurant selling southern german food. The dishes are very tasteful! The athmosphere is nice and the staff is great! You have to order the food at the counter and then it will be brought to your table.
1,"I went to Casa di Roma a while ago, invited by a friend upon recommendation by the Hotel Atlantic's concierge. While the food was decent, but hardly anything to write home about, the attitude of one manager in particular was rather disgusting. It seemed as if he didn't have a particularly nice day and felt like sharing the feeling with both his employees and guests, which I found utterly unacceptable. The friendly waitress tending our table could only try to limit the damage. Needless to say, I shall never return to Casa di Roma. Since then (listen up, conspiracy theorists worldwide!) I've learned that Casa di Roma is rather frequently recommended by hotel concierges in Hamburg. Personally, I have to wonder why. (Second star awarded personally to the waitress.)"
3,"I don't know how I missed this place during the first 6 weeks I lived in Hamburg only a short walk away!Came here for lunch with coworkers. I ordered the Gyrosteller mit Mextaca sahnesoße, tzatski und pommes. Very good, large portions, great lunch spot. The lunch menu comes with a small salad, main dish and a small desert. In this case, dessert was a cinnamon rice pudding with brown sugar.Very reasonably priced at only €6,90 per person.The staff was friendly and helpful. Our meal came out quick and they checked on us during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed and to ensure that it met our expectations."
4,"I've known this place for years, since when it first opened, then with the expansion, and to me it represents something beyond great food, beyond incredible success.  It is simply a brilliant operation.  If you order a durum doener for take out, and stand by the kitchen counter, it is like watching the movements of a Swiss watch - - but no watch part ever handed you one of the best doeners anywhere (superb balance of toothy vegetables, onion, and meat) with such a warm smile, and such care.  The in-house meals are superb value - - such a great spread of wonderful substances and delicious flavors.   The semi-outrageous colors, the constant bustle, the thoughtfulness and graciousness of the extremely busy staff - - it's no wonder that even after the expansion, this place is packed no matter when you go (mostly with Turks in the know).   Incredibly handy location right next to Altona Bhf.  It is one of a kind, and it is a kind worth enjoying often."
4,"Walked all around Hamburg in moderately cold weather and by the time the end of the day rolled around, we were hangry, tired, and ready for some good comfort food. Wanting to really grasp the authenticity of our trip to Germany, we decided on German food. This restaurant is fairly close to Wunderland so if you're heading over there, definitely recommend stopping by! Typically you have to make a reservation but we were lucky and arrived at around 5:30 pm and scored a nice little table for 2 by the window. They were super sweet in giving us a simplified english menu, along with the normal german one. I desperately tried to understand the regular menu but it was tough for someone who literally only knows ""danke"" and can barely pronounce it correctly!I was really craving Schnitzel and Spaetzle but unfortunately they did not have any spaetzle so I went for Schnitzel or the breaded pork with a fried egg and fried potatoes. My friend got the Salmon with Taligatelle. I also ordered a lübzer pils (0.5L obviously) and my friend took a bottle of still water.the food was super quick to arrive and it was delicious! my pork was moist, juicy with the most perfectly cooked and fresh egg (very yummy compared to the ones you get in the US!) and the potatoes were unbelievably tasty! My friend's pasta was also very well seasoned and her salmon was buttery and fresh. The meal really blew us away and hit the spot. Service was a little slow since it packed up quickly and we were all the way in the corner but that's fine--I enjoy the leisure of getting to relax and enjoy dinner at our own pace! Don't forget, if you pay with a card, you should definitely tip some cash extra. 10% is customary for sit down restaurants and Das Kontor definitely deserved it! Danke!!"
0,"They really didn't want to serve us, so we left.  They simply would not acknowledge our presence and when we asked they said they don't speak English well and they were too busy and did not have much food left.  Americans before us must have left them with a bad taste.  So, if you do not speak German well, maybe avoid this one."
2,"My UK colleague and I were seeking a late night seafood dinner around 10pm.  A woman in her late 20s recommended this Portuguese seafood restaurant, Gaststätte La Sepia in Sternschanze.  As we were in the city center, we took the S-Bahn to the Sternschanze and walked 5 mins to the restaurant.  The restaurant was relatively emply, so we were seated immediately.  I ordered a mixed grill fish platter, which included five types of fish, served with tartar sauce.  It was delicious and tasted fresh.  Some other reviews reported cockroaches in the fridge containing the fresh fish and being served moldy lemons with their fish. I wouldn't have visited the restaurant if I had read these reviews beforehand, but having been there, I can report the food was delicious, although I can't vouch for the hygiene!"
4,I ordered flat white and I must say that I've never before had such a good coffee. Might consider moving my home office here :-)
0,"Heard great things about this restaurant from a friend who travels to Hamburg frequently, and the fact that they closed at 11 was even better! The night before we had called to confirm what time their kitchen closed and we were told 10:30. However, when we arrived the next day at 9:10, we were told that they weren't seating + serving anymore and we were forced to find another dining option last min on our last night in Hamburg."
3,Price worthy food in a nice atmosphere.I had the most wonderful schnitzel with actually wonderful potatoes (they're not so often wonderful but these were) and chanterelle in sauce. A lovely dinner indeed.
2,"I was hoping to see the (low) standard of service that we encountered in Bavaria get better as we dined in Hamburg but it was not so. Service here was definitely slow and not very attentive. Our waiter spoke fine English and that part of the meal went well, but engaging him to get our order placed was a bit challenging.Yes, they have a printed menu. It's in German. There's also a list of daily specials on the board, written in German that we could sort of read. Google Translate doesn't work well when you can't work out what the letters are. And then, there's another list of specials that the waiter has in his head, which is... interesting.I let him talk me into a mushroom salad starter which was unusual and quite delicious. A variety of grilled mushrooms, shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Enough for two to share.For main course, I chose the spaghetti vongole. Very good, a plate of pasta tossed in olive oil and garlic and then topped with cherry tomatoes, clams, shrimp and other seafood. Other than the pasta was perhaps a little underdone (or my taste for it is off?), it was delicious and I ate nearly the whole thing. Keto? Not today!My friend had the pappardelle with a beef and veal sauce. She said it was delicious but pointed out that there was no parmesan cheese to be had anywhere. And once she pointed that out, it was strange. Our waiter wasn't to be seen after the food was delivered so after waiting a bit, we decided to dig in. By the time we spotted him, there wasn't much point.So what could have been a five star meal dropped to just three because the pasta was underdone (in my opinion) and the lack of service which just left us underwhelmed.Note: There is Trattoria da Enzo and they have another Trattoria Due Da Enzo around the corner.[Review 12053 overall, 1836 of 2019.]"
2,"Depending upon when you go, Mutter varies a lot. On the weekend it'll be so rammed that you can hardly get through the door and it'll be smokey as hell - the smoking ban does not apply here. However, when it's not so busy it's alright in here. It's never going to be my favourite bar, but I had a nice enough time here."
4,Great place to it with a very affordable price. I think they recently change their chef which now is not as good as it used to be but is still okay
4,"Had a great 3 course lunch menu here for EUR6.90: salad buffet, soup and a choice of main courses. Impressed."
4,"Great atmosphere, raw and minimalist deco, cheap original and fresh delicious cocktails (yep, all of it), awesome music, chill people...what would you want more for a Friday night?"
1,"Location, location, location. The view is fantastic - that's it. The drinks are mediocre but pricey, the staff is disinterested and poorly trained. Service is slow and needs to be hunted down. After two hours precisely, we were just about to order another round, he hostess came to our table with the next guests in tow, telling us she needed the table now - no reminder or warning, no alternative offered. There are more bars with better quality drinks and better service in town. Not going back to this one."
4,Best Dim Sum in HamburgDo not be scared of when having to go in basement. here the food is amazingEnjoy
4,"This was such a highlight of our trip to Hamburg. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the ordering concept is cool and easy, and the food is fantastic. The burgers, which they specialize in, are very tasty. I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. Unlike other reviewers I found the cheese to be perfectly melted. Also I ordered my burger medium-well and and it was perfectly cooked. The real winner at Burgerlich, however, is the pulled pork sandwich. My husband had it and i had such food envy. It is by far the best pulled pork sandwich I've tried anywhere in Germany and I would highly recommend it. The burgers are great, but the pulled pork sandwich is even better! The fries are really well done, crispy and perfectly seasoned. As the portions are pretty big it's possible to share fries between a couple. They have other sides like chips and salads as well. The prices are reasonable, especially for the food. Drink costs are a bit steep, but this is typical of most restaurants. The overall atmosphere is more on the hip and cool side. There was a dj playing pop music, which could be loud for some people, but we really enjoyed it. Overall I would highly recommend this place."
1,"As I am just a Polish turist, my opinion on those wurst is... not so amazing.If you wish to eat one hot sausage without any fork or knife, this is a place for you. Just an usual sausage in the middle of city centre. There are some tables available in nearby, but it is still in a middle of a busy pavement. I wasn't amazed, still what can you expect from such a dish for 3 EURO."
3,This wasn't very peaceful place to eat a lunch because the tables were near to each other and the place was full. But I didn't mind anymore as soon as I saw the prices! I didn't know that it's possible to eat fish so cheap... I had my suspicions until I tasted my salmon with peppersauce and it was purely delicious. The salmon was well done and I definitely recommend everyone else taste it as well.
3,"Great bar, with a crowd which can be most aptly described as resembling ""Shoreditch without the skinny jeaned, floppy haired, fixed gear riding wankers"". Really chilled atmosphere, lots of comfortable sofas, and reasonably priced drinks (2.5EUR for an Astra). Deserves special mention for being the first bar I've visited that sported a semi-conscious dog lying at the feet of its owner!"
1,"Went there on a Sunday for brunch+ or the reasons why you want to go there* Location & Atmosphere: The only reason you want to go there. At water level, still central but not overwhelmed with the crowd around the Alster a few meters away. Terrace is much larger than inside the restaurant, so you want to go there only on a sunny/warm day. There is also a possibility to sit on stairs with a drink facing the Alster and the city tower.* Food: For brunch there is a corner for 13,8EUR (drinks not included) with deli meats, smoked salmon, green salad, tomato mozzarella, veggies, scrambled/boiled eggs & white/wholewheat bread.- or the no go* Staff: a BIG downer, damn, the ladies there make you want to either go away or throw something at their faces. Attitudes (What for?) / Withering looks (need a moisturizer?) / Fish faces (Aquarium?).If you decide to go, do your best to ignore their lack of customer oriented skills (euphemism)* Food: 13,8eur is overpriced for what's served. Not a single dessert / cake on that buffet corner.The only veggies plate (eggplant, zucchini, carrots) available bathes in oil.Scrambled eggs look like there are made out of an omelette mix powder (really!?), I stayed away.All in All, You pay for the location which might be cool on a sunny day but even for that, staff might ruin the experience... too bad, I wont go again.  I do not recommend the place."
3,"Pretty cosy and comfy in here - once you were lucky enough to catch a free table. Then you can enjoy yourself pretty well. (Sadly advance bookings cannot be taken for Sundays as I was told a couple of times.)There's plenty of British traditional food on offer like (tiny) scones, pies and all sorts of tea. Also quite a selection of home-made cake but be aware of the large slices, deary me! But everything's lovely and definitely worth the visit. It's a nicely decorated (sofa, candles, paintings, walls painted in green) tearoom that makes one feel at home straight away. You can easily imagine three old British ladies sitting there gossiping away idlely and sipping their black tea. Well especially now that it's getting autumn and dark outside, Lühmanns is a great place for an escape. A possible walk around Blankenese and the water is a nice bonus as to the area. As the previous folks said too though, staff are always oh so slow and prone to forget orders. However they have as yet never forgotten about the billSo bring plenty of time & patience (and maybe a good book) and you'll be perfectly happy. I'd recommend it especially to anyone anglophile."
4,"Giving this a 5 star rating & it was pretty impressive! I believe it is best to come on a later time (5-6pm onwards) & they have less visitors. Your chance of getting near the rail to get a better look at the models are higher. Not to mention from 6pm onwards, you have a 10% discount!! It is not meerly model trains or planes ... If you look closely at the models, you would realize there are lots of stories to tell. Expect at least an hour minimum to spend in there (esp when you pay attention to small details). They also adjust the lights in some area to make it like 'day time' & 'night time'. Both, of course, are enjoyable to look at!!"
3,"Pretty awesome place, I found it after reading the Yelp reviews as there are 4 falafel places in a row pretty much. Service for starters was welcoming, even though the place was busy in my opinion I was treated with respect and the owners seemed humble. That was a nice feeling to start off with.I ordered a falafel with aubergine, the best was when I saw it being wrapped - it was huge! All for 3,50 Eur, awesome. And delicious - great to know you're not eating meat and it still fills you and tastes great.The joint actually has a smallish upstairs section including toilet, and apparently they have Wifi as well, but I couldn't find the password. The upstairs section was really cosy for a takeaway kind of place, clean as well. I'll definitely come back here and try more things from the menu."
4,"What a magical world they have created! Halls over halls filled with impressive and amusing details, this railroad model museum took this art form to another level. Even if you haven't heard of it, it is quite an experience. Although I was skeptical at first, the imagination and skills of the two brothers undoubtably deserve our admiration. It was adorable how they took inspiration from actual travels to the different countries and made the landscapes their own. You could spend days here discovering new details...It was great to see they had several opportunities to donate to the respective countries' struggles- a way to give back in a playful setting. We also appreciated the free beverages and perfectly organized waiting room area while waiting 45 minutes to get in. Proud that Germany has such a wonderfully unique museum to offer!"
4,Great place. Good prices. Cozy and comfortable. Air is filled with scent of coffee and tasty cakes. Perfect spot for a coffee after a meal at Fish & Co.
2,"Definitely not my cup of tea. Thankfully I've only been once. It's actually a couple years back and it ended up being the most expensive meal I've ever paid for (seriously!) I had invited an ex and her folks out to dinner. They had taken us out many times hence it was payback time. Unfortunately they were big eater and drinkers. A multi-course meal and many bottles (expensive as all hell) later we left this place, my wallet empty. Thankfully the food is ok and definitely of higher quality. The wine selection was also good. Yet, would I go back? No! I particularly dislike the decor and places like this in general. The majority of people eating here are not my crowd. It's fineplaces like this are made for those people. And one star is added to this review for providing such a place for them. That keeps 'em away from my favorite places. If you like typical Hamburg flair, with a real feeling of lots of Hanseatic upper class around you, this is your mecca. You can't go wrong with the food as it is a well run establishment. You probably won't be going here if you can't afford it so prices won't discourage you. The location is also quite nice I have to admit. I nice old house.perfect if you live nearby on the Elbchaussee and there's parking in the back..bring your Bentley's if you got 'em! If you're young, modern, cosmopolitan or anything but Hanseatic blue-blood, you'll feel better elsewhere."
4,"This American and all my American friends absolutely love Qrito. It is so fresh and delicious I could eat there everyday. Some of my friends actually do! It is the closest thing to the USA's Chipotle or Qdoba. It was a blessing to experience this place on the recommendation of a friend and not only do they have comforting mexican food, they have American candies and American sized soda cans in flavors you can't get anywhere else. Lunchtime is typically packed with students, but you'll get a seat with a little bit of patience. The people that work there are always friendly and even bring your order to you once it is ready. Word has spread about how great and fresh the food is and I would recommend this place to anyone. The prices are not bad at all and they are always efficient with their service. Various meat choices as well as hot sauces."
3,"In one phrase: very authentic Bavarian place. Icecold genuine Bavarian beer served in huge Steins, typical Bavarian food, waiters in Bavarian clothes (dresses/Lederhosn), and, ehm, ""nice"" Bavarian music. You really would not realize you are in the north of Germany if it did not read ""Hamburg"" on the Menu...If you like Bavarian culture, you definitely will like this venue!"
0,"I was suggested this place and brought to it by my boyfriend. As the ambiance is great, the clientele is anything but high class (the service and food was not much better). Not only did this over-involved couple who stared at us from the moment we walked in, made us feel uncomfortable and then to top it off, on their way out they wrote a very unwelcome note to my boyfriend (who did not speak great English at the time) implying nasty things about me and telling him to get up and leave the table. Mind you, we had been there barely ten minutes, not spoken much and I had never met this couple before in my life. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but considering my man and I were not fighting, nor were we having an argument or any other sort of spat, it was somewhat uncalled for and very rude. I know many people think they are so great at reading people, but trust you YOU ARE NOT. So before you think you can go get involved in others lives, maybe think twice. As for my experience at this place IT WAS DOWNRIGHT FUCKING HORRIBLE following that. Potatoes under-cooked, table water was WARM. Do not bother, not worth the service, nor the food, nor having to deal with the over-entitled, under-educated, arrogant clientele that this place attracts."
3,"+ Tasty German-French Fusion cuisine, + nice view over Hamburg Harbor, + recommended for business dinners, special occasions, and private eventsThe Carls belongs to Hotel Louis C. Jacob and convinces with the same outstanding quality. Although located in the hot spots of Hamburgs' new harbor city Carls is attracting the casual foodie. Its interior uses elements from French brasseries and bistros including a full French loaf as starter. At the Brasserie guests can choose between leather booths facing the restaurant's inside and the Elbe River or tables next to the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river or the new Elbphilharmonic. The menu includes a German-French fusion cuisine and a comprehensive wine list (EUR 20 - 390 with an average bottle price of EUR 40). If listed I recommend to try the cold vichyssoise (actually the best I ever had) in combination with 'Carls Fass' a dry Riesling.Be cautious ordering their water flate rate, which isn't a real flat rate since every carafe is finally balanced on your check! The average costs per person, including drinks are about EUR 65 if you order a la carte or choose a prix fixed menu with wine. People on a budget don't have to refrain from the delicious food since Carls' Bistro offers affordable small plates from EUR 5 - 13 and wines from EUR 4 - 6."
4,"Awesome place for super-competent cocktails including a few finds and specials. It is hidden away off the main Kiez strip in a residential block, and not a hip nor cool place. All the better!The drinks are stiff and their quality undisputed. And you won't go wrong simply ordering your favorite drink here for a 'how it should always be' version of it."
4,i eat there once or 2 times a week. the food is always delicious.the employees are friendly and they always offer me a free tea :)
3,This place is perfect for a short stop. Good Service with very friendly servants will offer you a sattisfied stay at this bar. Also the food isn't expensive it is quite good and they are very uncomplicated with fullfilling special wishes and preferences.
2,"ahhh roschinskys. I have ended many a night in here, and always wondered, well, why? Its exactly the same as every other bar long the street. It has the same people (are they cardboard cut-outs?) it even has the same drinks and the same bar staff. Not really original in my eyes and nothing special to write home about. The people are friendly enough, the crowd is youngish and the music is ok. nothing out of the ordinary, and too crowded late at night for my tastes."
4,"Jimmy Elsass is a bit of a cult favorite among friends and coworkers, so I'm under a lot of pressure to give them anything but five stars. But then again, they've earned it on every single one of my visits. The space itself is a bit dark and dreary (very reminiscent of Hamburg itself), but the service is friendly and helpful, and the food and drink are excellent. ""Elsass"" is German for Alsace, and the menu is dominated by flammkuchen, the Alsatian baked flatbread specialty, with all kinds of toppings. I always get something different, and they're all good, but you can't go wrong with an original (cream, onions, lardons). The wine is also dominated by Alsatian options, all of which are also quite good. The waiters mostly speak English, and they only accept cash payment. Give it a try."
1,"In 20 years visiting Block House restaurants I have never had such a bad experience. It was so crowded, with a long line at the entrance, and you could feel the stress in the restaurant. Not enough service personal, food came slow, nobody came to check on us after we received our ordered dishes. The food was ok, but nothing super delicious. The children's dish (pasta with tomatoe sauce) was about the size of a table spoon. After we enquired about the size we were told there would be another serving. That never arrived. An ordered glass of wine only came after two additional requests. For the check we waited about 20 minutes without luck, and only when we left the table, and approached the front desk we were ""allowed"" to pay. Shame on Block House for such a bad performance. Might have to find a new favorite restaurant."
2,Went there for lunch with some colleagues and had the Tiki Burger with baked potatoes and a coke light.The meal arrived quickly in under 10 minutes.The Burger was good but not in my top 10 and the baked potatoes could be a little bit more crispy.The price for the  meal and one drink was 12 Euro and they allow to split the bill.
2,"After burgers me and my family took a vote: from 1-5, how many stars. So... 2 votes for 3 stars, 1 for 4, and since I was counting votes I got to be indecisive and go for 3,5 stars. Result is 3 stars. Best things first : meat quality seemed fine. Bun is symbolic, has to be there to give you an illusion of something else than meat overload. I got the classic burger and to me it was a bit heavy on the mustard. But otherwise real greasy like expected. And a s***load of fries. Never seen that many fries on one plate before. Actually kind of scary. A bit too much even.And then the bad: what is up with the acoustics in this place? It fills up pretty quickly after 6pm, and with the people comes the noise. And OMG we had to yell to have a conversation. It was almost impossible to hear what the others at the table said. Its ok with noise, but this was ridiculous. I would go there again if asked, but preferably with more beer and less conversation involved."
3,"Went to Carls while staying at the Westin hotel on a business trip. Was confused first about where to enter. The front is more a small bar but the back is the Brasserie for dinner. After we cleared this confusion we sat down for a good dinner. Service was good and uncomplicated. Had the Codfish (skreifisch) dinner which was delicious and well prepared. Waiter was attentive and just when we felt that it was time to go he showed up with the bill. He was reading his customers well. Menus are in German (not an issue for me) but a place like this could benefit from an English version of the menu. I heard servers English spoke. Conversation going on, so we were not unique in that regard."
4,"I wish Panter was closer to where I live. It's one of the coolest cafes in Hamburg, but I never go here because it's a bit out of the way for me. The menu is a little bit limited, but what they offer they do well. For breakfast there is a selection of omelets and later the menu reverts to being just soup, salad, pasta or paninis. They also have a yummy-looking range of cakes."
2,"I have eaten here 3 times now, twice for lunch and once for dinner and to be honest my experiences have been fairly mixed hence my score of 3 stars.I agree with the previous review in as much as there seems to be too few staff for the customers. In the evening when you can eat at a leisurely pace you don't really mind waiting a bit but at lunchtime when you need to eat fairly quickly what should be a relaxing break from work can become a highly stressful situation followed by indigestion! (and a big bill) However, I did find that if you stress to the waiters that you are in a rush they do try and accommodate you.I cannot fault the food though, everything I have eaten has been fabulous with the arrabbiata being my favourite. If you have plenty of time to spare and a few extra pennies in your purse its worth trying it out for yourself."
4,Super great food.  Someone back there knows their way around the kitchen!  Great service.  Extremely friendly.  Nice and reasonable lunch specials.  Very nce atmophere; well decorated.  Grab a bite when you are waiting for the Miniature Museum.
3,I've been dying to go back ever since I tried Kuchnia. Such a cozy atmosphere with a great selection of cocktails and wine and the pierogis were all so delicious.
2,"Came here because it was close to my hotel and lookd like a popular place.  It was good but doesn't beat Red Robin IMO.  Anyway, I was looking around and noticed something odd, from an american stand point.  This is what I learned.  Germans eat their burgers with a fork and knife."
3,having a cup of really good espresso at marsbar also includes usage of their free wifi (wlan). sometimes you meet some b-celebrities like sylvie van der vart or her husband there. maybe because marsbar is close to RTL nord.its nicer in summer because you can sit outside and smoke.
0,"Mice in the restaurant, unfriendly host - not recommended!This was my 3rd time at L'Osteria at Opernplaza/Dammtorstrasse in Hamburg and by far the worst experience.The host that greeted us was unkind and rude when we suggested to wait at the bar for our table. He lectured us that we would take away seats for other customers - well, we just wanted to wait for table - go figure....Anyways, the worst part was the mice that were running around in the restaurant. When we told the waitress she waived our concerns away, telling us this would be common in the inner city. I wonder what the Hamburgian health department's opinion is on this topic...This said, this was my last visit since the pizza was mediocre as well."
2,The food is ok for a sports bar but you need to be early if you want to catch a match and have food. Would recommend.
3,"I've had decent lunches at Billy The Butcher a couple of times now. It's what I would describe as a trendy burger joint on the 4th floor of the Alsterhaus department store. The idea is that the meat is high-quality, the food is straightforward, and the service is friendly. I think all of those are accurate.The menu is short (a good thing), with a choice of about four beef burgers, one chicken burger, and one veggie burger. There's also a beef tartare option if you're uncomfortable with any heat applied to your meat. I've always ordered the cheeseburger, and in my opinion it's good. They offer ""medium"" and ""well done"" for the beef burgers, and ""medium"" is consistently what I would call medium-rare in the US (which I'm happy about).You can't get a burger without fries, and their fries are pretty tasty. Lately the standard serving is a mixture of potato and sweet potato (I think this is new), but they're reliably good. You have to pay extra for any sauces/condiments, which is unfortunately too typical. The part that's even more dismaying is that the tiny cups of mayo are 1 Euro each. I mean, if you're going to charge me a Euro for mayonnaise, at least give me my money's worth.They also serve classic cocktails in the evening, along with beer and wine. I've never attended, but it would make a classy but low-key place to have a drink with a friend after work."
3,"We tried the brand new American Brunch this past Sunday morning. Being an American I am usually fairly skeptical about anything advertised as ""American"". We arrived at 11 am and had our choice of tables inside or out. It was a breezy morning and we sat on the shady side of the house. (There isn't a sunny side this time of morning at the Chilehaus!) Cushions and blankets made the hard wood benches very comfortable. Our order was taken promptly by a friendly waiter and off we went to the buffet. I was quite happy to see pancakes and bacon as well as two types of eggs (scrambled and soft boiled). For the Brits there were sausages and beans, as well. The ""make your own"" waffles were a big hit with my kids and husband. The buffet also had the typical German breakfast items, such as Brötchen, assorted breads and toast bread, cheeses, meats, jams, jellies, cream cheeses, yogurts, etc. I also enjoyed the more lunch-y items: chili, wraps and steamed veggies. All of us finished our brunch off with a giant portion of fresh fruits. The food was good, well-prepared and quickly replenished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The brunch costs just under 15€ and includes a prosecco, a warm drink and an orange juice - quite a bargain, I think. My one and only suggestion would be to put out those mini glass bowls for the maple syrup. We will surely go back again!"
4,"Great steak place, in my mind comparable to Outback Steakhouse, if not better.  A chain, but great quality none the less.  If you're looking for a good American style steak in Germany, this is the place!  Their homemade sour cream tastes incredible, also.  Dog and kid friendly."
3,"I was there with a group of friends from Japón and my boyfriend. Their love the sashimi, the quality is the fish was good and of course fresh. I was exciting because of the yakitory, but it was the worst dish from the table.I'll try to go again to give them another change."
3,Good location and delicious cakes. But the wifi is very slow when I wanted to use it on my Macbook.
0,"If you are Vietnamese and looking for good viet food, don't come here. Not only was the waitress rude but the food did not taste one bit Vietnamese. I asked the waitress if she spoke Vietnamese and she looked at me like I said something disrespectful. And when I asked for the check, she yelled at one of her employees to bring it to me in German. But hey, what do you expect by getting Vietnamese food in Germany.Zero stars"
4,"Can't believe I've never reviewed Olivio! A firm lunch favourite of mine (check today's pizza monza which is sat inside of me right now), this is perhaps the friendliest restaurant in Hamburg, nay, the world! A hilarious husband and wife team had us writing down our order on a piece of paper and delivering it to the kitchen today! If you go on a Friday lunchtime you often get free wine refills, not that I drink at lunch of course... Brilliant."
3,One of my favourite bars on the Reeps. great cocktails. try a St Pauli Killer.
4,"It feels a little odd - writing a review about a bridge, but this bridge is no ordinary bridge. The Köhlbrandbrücke is a 3.5km long steel monster which leads from one part of the harbor to another. The bridge is perfect for a sightseeing tour. Accessible only to vehicles (no bicycles or pedestrians allowed on the bridge) driving over the Köhlbrandbrücke gives you an amazing view of Hamburg's harbor and a glimpse of the sheer size of the harbor district. The view from the Köhlbrandbrücke by day is a must-see for both tourists and residents interested in seeing more of Europe's 2nd largest harbor."
3,"Nice selection of coffees, spacious interior and tons of good food options."
4,"An excellent Indian cafe a short walk from the Hauptbahnhof. Don't expect nice table cloths and stylish service but the food is great. Also, check out their Indian sweets with a sugar content so high it should be illegal. It's strange that some if the best Asian cuisine is served in little cafés like this."
4,A fabulous way to spend a few hours chilling in Hamburg with amazing views of the river. The deck chairs are perfect for relaxing and switching off with a drink. A highlight of our trip.
0,"We were invited to a large dinner party at La Sepia and had high hopes. The folks around the table kept buzzing about how the restaurant is known for it's good fish, and any fish I was bound to order would probably be the best fish I had had in a while. Unfortunately, the fish at La Sepia blows. No, I didn't get a bad dish - the folks next to me, who also ordered the ""Fischplatte"" (an assortment of different types of fish), received the exact same meal. All sat there swooning over their meals as I stared bored over my food, fork in hand, and exclaimed: ""THIS is what you think good fish tastes like?!?"". Don't get me wrong - for many people, the fish at La Sepia will be the best fish they have ever tasted. These people have probably been mainly having fish from the Elbe river. The sauce is pretty good. For the rest of us who are used to Mediterranean fish, the fish at La Sepia will be dull, tasteless and boring. Conclusion: He who travels to the coast of the Mediterranean sea shall have real fish. He who stays in Hamburg should stick to sardines."
3,"Nice little French bistro. Cozy and warm on the inside with outdoor seating available on a warm day. Their menu mainly consists of galettes (French savory crêpes), quiches, cheese, some wines and beers. I can't recall the rest but it is mainly French.I had the galette au jambon et fromage; cheese and ham galette. It was very good, the best part being the crunchy well done texture of the crepe. The ham and cheese was good too on there which washed down well with the Reisling that I had. Galette cost 6,90 which is really good especially for the area it is in. I strayed from my standard galette choice of la complète but I'll definitely be coming back to see theirs is like."
3,High end steak house with good steaks from various countries and nice wines...though I personally feel they overpriced the California wines (I am from the US and know the California wine prices in the US).  Atmosphere is high end.  Interior is clean and nice.  Prices are high but worth the overall experience. Just don't buy the Cali wines.
3,"This is a pretty big and nice Irish pub. You've got your typical Guinness and Magners but also surprisingly a large selection of craft beer. I had the 'Zweitel' and that was pretty damn good. This is a great place to hang out with others but as I came to watch the footie; they have 2 TVs on which they show games, it was a little disappointing with the music playing and no game sounds being heard hence the loss of a star. Great bar to hang but not super great to watch football in my opinion."
4,"Qype City night January '08 brought me here. They had prepared a great set menu for us. Nine dishes, they said, but I'm pretty certain it was more like 12. We had cold dishes to start, glass noodles, cold meats, tofu & garlic, etc. That wasn't really my thing, but each successive course brought better and better food. One course brought some really great prawns. They were messy to eat, but delicious. After the two (or three, I forget) main courses came some amazing soup, and after that we got one small sweet dish. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it seemed like dates covered in dough, rolled in sesame seeds. The best chinese food I've had in Hamburg (Ok, I've not really had much chinese food, but still :)"
3,"This was an interesting and educational way to spend two hours on a rainy day in Hamburg. We did the tour which includes decorating your own chocolate bar, learning about the process of chocolate from the raw cocoa pods and importing and then how it's turned into the delicious chocolate at the end. Our tour guide spoke terrific English (check their schedule for what languages are toured at what times) and it was quite educational.Of course, there's a huge chocolate gift shop at the end and how can you not buy a bunch of interesting edible and decorative items to bring home?Expect to eat some chocolate along the way, so don't be too stuffed when you arrive.[Review 12058 overall, 1841 of 2019.]"
4,Unbelievably good food! I had the quiche and my daughter had the farfalle. Absolutely delicious! We also split the carrot cake. It was moist and light. Must eat there again!
3,"Quan Do's food i good, but the menu is very limited to Pho, fried noodles, weekly offers and some appetizers. BUT nonetheless the Pho I had was delicious as well as the spring rolls. The only thing I didn't like was the staff which was a bit rude (maybe I caught them on a bad day) and the fact that you cannot get Pho to go or take leftovers with you. They only offer a large Pho, which is pretty big, so it's sad that you have to waste the leftovers. Besides that I think the restaurant is great (no sure how much it qualifies as street food though) and I will be going here again!"
4,"As everyone knows...I'm addicted to great coffee!! And this is the place to find it. At first I was worried that it was a tourist coffee company and I was happily wrong. The coffee is super strong and fantastic. I was in town with my husband visting a friend and we came here multiple times during our visit. Almost filled the entire stamp card. And I'm also a sucker for a stamp card. I definitely enjoy the cafe itself as well. It's very modern and plenty of space. The service is very friendly. The waitress insisted that I sit down and that I could pay later. The culture in Europe is definitely to not be rushed and sit an enjoy the break in the day. Also who can't be in love with the ""Deathspresso"" icon and slogan!! ""Schlafen kannste du wann du tot bist"", ""You can sleep when you're dead!""Wach auf Hamburg!!"
4,"My fav stop in Hamburg. Best vibes, good music, good people, lovely bartenders"
4,"An overwhelming experience in taste.  Every dish was equally delicious - antipasti dish, pasta Bolognese, and Hake with quinoa."
4,"Richtig lecker, nette Personal, immer wieder."
4,Very good restaurant if you want American food while in Germany. Terrific selection and superb taste. Lovely atmosphere and the bartender is a sweetheart.
3,"Great source for Hamburg's bestest chips. And I hear their Currywurst is much appreciated by the carnivores, too.I can only rate their Grillgold (chips) which is excellent. Tomato sauce, mayonnaise and vinegar are splashed out for free. Nice! Prices are generally okay seeing that they sell e.g. organic Wurst. :)The grill master can be a little slow indeed but has as yet never been unfriendly.Schmitt's is always a good place of refuge before the drinking starts - or after the drinking has been done.I have heard rumours of people who came in twice on one single night Addictive so! ;)"
0,"Chocoversum is a chocolate museum and not a factory; tours are only available in German and with that said, be prepared to get lost in translation if unable to speak the language. Regular price is 14€ but cheaper with a student discount. Lockers are available for a 1€.I have read a review under trip advisor about ""unlimited chocolate sampling"" and it's not samples of the good chocolate we would expect, it's the chocolate that comes from the cacao ""seed"" (look at photos); which is very bitter.  Tour covers location of cacao plants, where its grown, the process of making chocolate, etc, etc. Tourists will be able to decorate their own chocolate bar and will be distributed at the end of the tour. The chocolate store is also available right as soon as you exit the.Being in Germany where chocolate is an all-time fave, I had high expectations for this place. Although the milk chocolate bar was great, I have expected more; c'mon, it's a chocolate museum! In conclusion, Chocoversum was pretty disappointing and not worth visiting in my opinion."
4,"I just had dinner with my mom who is visiting me from California and I chose this restaurant for several reasons.  They have a very nice seafood selection of fresh whole grilled fishes, grilled scallops, tuna tartare, and a beautiful night view of the Elbe. When weather is warm like it was tonight, sit outside so you can feel the breeze and watch boats drift by. The wait staff is extremely friendly and service is good here without any posh attitude.  We ordered a sampler dessert at the end which I enjoyed because you do not feel guilty after eating three different desserts, haha!  My mom really loved it, and if you only have one night to enjoy a lovely dinner near the water, this local well known spot should be on your list of options.  If you enjoy sushi as much as I do, the sashimi on the menu is also nice but the options are limited. For a full bevy of sushi choices and an extravaganza of delicious rolls, Henssler & Henssler is just around the corner from here.Ask for Valentin, he is the best waiter ever, just charming and catered to our every culinary need spoken and unspoken :)"
2,"Not really for my taste, i think it was a bit overpriced for what we got. Ambient was nothing special. The staff was actually very nice and friendly"
4,"This place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Probably the best tourist attraction i have seen so far! I was really surprised at how much i enjoyed my time here. I went in thinking I would spend one hour at most in this place and three hours later i could not get enough of this miniature wonderland. They have really thought of everything when creating the little moniture wonderland. The amount of detail that was put into this world is absolutely astounashing! As soon as you walk in they have the exhibit of a town in germany and they take you through the history of the town through various years. As you walk through they have a display of Switzerland, Hamburg, The airport, USA, Scandanvia and Bavaria (there might be one or two that i am missing maybe?) Italy was under construction. My absolute favorite was Switzerland, it was huge and it extended a bit on the third floor. Make sure you spend enough time in each country for the day-night transition because that blew my mind. The way the lights flickered and the train lights came one at a time was very life-like. They even had little miniature people inside the trains and cars as they went by. You will experience everything in this place, from a miniature concert experience to even little disasters (I don't want to spoil anything). This place is a must-see attraction. If you are in hamburg you have to go! Best 12euros I have ever spend!"
2,"Marsbar - for that little taste of Munich and Düsseldorf right in the west of Hamburg! I went there with a mate due to the simple fact that he likes the wine by the glass there. I hadn't visited the place before, because I know it's a favourite hangout of the Eppendorf Glitterati and hence doesn't exactly suit me down to the ground. Yet that evening at Marsbar turned out to be much more interesting than what I'd bargained for But first things first: the vain bodybuilder-cum-waiter is in place, as is an abundance of the cashmere-clad wealthy. It can get rather crowded, even though Falkenried isn't exactly the cosiest of places - but to see and be seen is apparently of much greater importance than an inviting atmosphere to many. As it got dark, things got a lot more interesting: there was the loud, aging gold-digger (-turned-wife?), whose favourite pastime seems to be shouting names in her loudest voice, especially when she sees a rather well-known German TV chef sitting at the other end of the terrace. After a few more people's names she changed her approach and screamed the names of some holiday resorts. Needless to say, her voice was of the shrill kind and hard to overhear. Yet Madmoiselle Namedropper wasn't the lady that left the biggest impression. That honour must go to a 40-something, sitting together with a bunch of obviously well-off friends, having a glass of wine. So far, so unimpressive - if it wasn't for the fact that she was obviously at her 15th glas and pissed senselessly. At first I thought it was some kind of candid camera comedy performance, but any sense of fun was lost when she, still sitting on her chair, fell to the side, not moving for a few seconds. One could hear a needle drop for a few moments, until a waiter (not Jean-Claude van Damme's bigger brother, but another, friendlier one) came to her rescue. And this was when I really couldn't believe my own eyes: not only couldn't her friends be arsed to help her, they also didn't feel bothered to take her home and to bed, preferring to stay until last orders instead. While Ms Boozer was still babbling and swaying relentlessly. I guess the Eppendorf Glitterati have their own etiquette It may be unfair that this grotesque evening will forever dominate my impression of Marsbar, but a bar is very much defined by its costumers. And, based on this visit, I have to say they're a strange lot. Apart from that I can commend their Ginger Ale (served with ice and a slice of orange!) and mint tea - the drinks selection in general seems to be decent, tough not exactly cheap. So go there if you consider yourself part of the upper class hoi polloi or if you have a penchant for the weirdly embarrassing. Just know what you can expect."
2,"Turmbar is certainly unique. It's a little bar in an old water tower (?) thing. Walking to the bar seemingly takes forever, going round and round in circles. At the top there is a little bar that serves most of what you'd expect. The main problem is the slight lack of windows!"
