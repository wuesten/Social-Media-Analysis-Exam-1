4,"I ended up here by accident one Sunday afternoon when a heavy thunderstorm turned the Hafencity into an extension of the Elbe river. The place was tightly packed with people looking for refuge from the storm. I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and the low prices for coffee drinks (about a Euro less than Starbucks and Balzac for a large latte). They also offers salads and noodle dishes in addition to great sandwiches. Summary: Lovely chain coffee shop that offers more food choices and cheaper and better coffee than Starbucks and Balzac. Interior is stylish and staff is very friendly. My favorite coffee place now, other locations are nice as well."
4,"How is this the first English review of Speicherstadt? Speicherstadt is basically a must-see part of Hamburg. In the past this set of islands was used as a duty-free zone for ships to unload, with customs only coming into force as you crossed one of the many bridges. Nowadays the old warehouses hold a few tourist attractions like the Hamburg Dungeon and the Miniature railway. Randomly they also hold the largest amount of persian rugs outside of Tehran! (Or so I've heard)"
3,"Great bar, with a crowd which can be most aptly described as resembling ""Shoreditch without the skinny jeaned, floppy haired, fixed gear riding wankers"". Really chilled atmosphere, lots of comfortable sofas, and reasonably priced drinks (2.5EUR for an Astra). Deserves special mention for being the first bar I've visited that sported a semi-conscious dog lying at the feet of its owner!"
4,"Just go to this restaurant. If you want to eat the food that's cooked in India, this is the place. We took chicken palak and okra thali and samosa as starters. Oh god! I never ate samosa taste like how it should be before I came here. The food was tasty, filling and quick. This is how you would probably eat at food corners in India. Go badshah!"
3,Great burgers - best I've had in years - I had the Crack Burger and it was kind of addictive but I wouldn't have sold my body for it. Service is slow though. I down rated one star because of this. I would have down rated two stars - but they acknowledged the poor service in the menu.
2,"- 20EUR all you can eat (I think that is all they do really) is actually fairly priced in my opinion.- yes agree with some of the reviews here, better sushi can be found elsewhere, however it's a 3 star for me still as the quality is good enough, and service is friendly- yes, cosy place but always have room for baby pushchair in the corner and staff is always friendly and helpful"
3,"The smallest venue Ive probably ever been to- so small you have to exit and wait out front when bands are setting up their gear on stage- which can be rather cold in the winter... Cool little place under the railway lines which generally has shows from local or small bands on tour- 6 Euros will usually get you in a show- which is a great way to discover new music in a cool environment. The Astra Stube seems like a Hamburg instuition of sorts and they almost had to close this December, but were able to extend their lease for a few more years- so go support local/independent live music!"
2,"Sausalitos is pretty much a night club that serves food. This place is really nice for a bar/club but i wouldnt really call it a restaurant. The food is what made me drop off a star from the review. We went there with a large group of people and had a table reserved. The service was really great and fast considering the place is packed (it was a thursday during their happy hour specials). The food is your typical bar finger food. Considering they advertise themselves as a mexican restaurant i thought maybe the nachos would be good. I ordered the nachos and the cheese was extremly hard and a pain to seperate each chip. I got the guac and salsa on the side. Spoiler alert: the guac here is NOT green...it was a little grey looking and it barely tasted like guac. The waiter confirmed it was the guac i ordered. I would highly reccomend to stay away from the nachos. The food might not be great but the drinks are AMAZING! They have really fun cocktails here and awesome specials during happy hour. I got the 'flying kangaroo' and it tasted like a milkshake and you dont event feel the alcohol, but there is a ton in there. Also, the drink sizes were HUGE! The ambiance is totally a club feel, the music is WAY too loud you will find yourself screaming at your friends sitting next to you. In the basement they have the 'club' which has hip hop music, different than the 'restaurant' upstairs."
4,"We sat outside on the hilltop patio with gorgeous views of the water. They planted a line of trees along the edge, and they form a canopy of leaves above interwoven with a bamboo lattice (wonderful design). We ordered the raspberry lemonade (tasty), lamb and roast (everything was delicious and melted in our mouths). Wish we had time for dessert. Wonderful spot to enjoy lunch."
2,"Top option whenever friends come to Hamburg. Changed price a little but still acceptable. Rice was a little bit hard last time there, although taste still."
3,"Had a blissfully wonderful evening at Brüdigams.  We came for the schnitzel, and were fully satisfied.  The restaurant is small, with walls covered in cookbooks, mismatched tables, and a small bar in front of the kitchen.  You can peek through the windows and see everything going on in the kitchen.  The service was lovely, relaxed, and present.  We ordered the minestrone soup and each our own schnitzel.  We were delighted at the small taste the kitchen sent out, which was rhubarb and fresh greens meant to be taken in one bight.  The bread brought my boyfriend back to his childhood because it reminded him of the bread his mother used to buy.  It came with olive  tapenade and we tried to save it for the soup.  The presentation for the soup was very nice, the bowl came out hot, with the two raviolis and a few spring vegetables in it, then the broth was poured on from a tea pot.  The broth was very tasty, but the soup lacked vegetables and any resemblance to a minestrone soup.  The schnitzel was fabulous.  Traditional, home made and tasted so fresh.  I had roasted potatoes with mine, while my boyfriend ordered a mashed potato/rhubarb mix.  Both came with ""grandmas"" cucumber salad. We were too full for desert.They offer a menu for around 30 euros where the guest can select an appetizer, main dish and dessert.  If we had been more hungry we would have taken them up on that offer.  There is also a prix fixe menu with seasonal selections on the first page.  Something I would also like to try. Like I said, we had a wonderful experience!"
2,"There's nothing wrong with Chakra, in my opinion. The interior is comfortable enough, with a mix of couches and chairs; the staff is friendly and moderately attentive, and the prices are, well, fine. It's just the mediocre nature of the place--just another bar/cafe/restaurant in the Schanze. We both had vegetable tacos and a beer, and in keeping with the general feel, were neither disappointed nor particularly impressed. How very--ho hum."
4,"Looking for organic food in Hamburg, Google found this for us. It is truly a little paradise. Our host Peter Kühn took great care of Colleen and me!"
4,I love Starbucks so much! This one has one of the best views I've ever seen and free Wi-Fi (log out and in again every 2 hours). Will def come back for more ice chai tea latte
3,"Tours cost around €15 per person, which seemed a bit much at first.  The tour lasted around 90 minutes, and we took the English one (there is one English tour M-F per day and two on the weekend days).  It walked us through the process to make chocolate and offered 7 samples throughout the process from bean to wrapped chocolate which they made throughout the tour.  Our guide was awesome, and made the whole thing well worth it.  Also, we got to decorate our own bar of chocolate to take home as a souvenir."
4,Great coffee and food. The staff was very friendly. The vegan waffles were so good. The best vegan waffles I've had! Actually the place was so good I had to come back again the next day.
3,"This is a very cozy and nice place to hang out and grab some food with friends. They have great vegetarian/vegan choices and are a good pick for people who like the middle-eastern cuisine. Unfortunately they were out of a few things that I wanted to try when we were there but my overall experience was still good. The prices are very good, too!"
4,"Richtig lecker, nette Personal, immer wieder."
4,"Wonderful Wonderland, we love going there. Even though it is very crowded and one needs a lot of patience, it is always a great joy. Especially the airport is so exciting, we could have spent hours there!We booked our visit in combination with a harbour boat tour and the Wunderland was open until 1 or 2 am. I'm not sure if they do that regularly though. So the later it was the more people left and we actually had some space and could enjoy everything.We will go again!!!"
4,"Amazing. I am a bit of a foodie and traveler and this was one of the best restaurants I've dined in. If you are looking for authentic German food, white tablecloth service, a local atmosphere, and an unbelievable price point- look no further. My brother and I stumbled in later in the night, but the kitchen gladly remained open until close and served us with enthusiasm. Our server was lovely and made us feel at home. The food was outstanding (get the pancakes). We ordered a few courses and drinks and our bill was only about €45. We were expecting more. If we return to Hamburg, we will return to Sangers."
3,"Fabulous brunch on Sunday! A bit pricy but it includes juices and coffee, so actually just fine.. lots of veggies, warm and cold dishes...... nice service... great bread... all good!"
4,"Delicious Ramen and good service! It was quite full that day - there was a little queue outside, so I recommend coming there early."
1,"Interesting little restaurant. It was packed, and it seemed that food was being served almost cafeteria style on silver trays, so I figured it practical to order take away. One would think I would receive the same amount of food by paying the same price (and not taking up table space in the tiny restaurant for that matter), but I ended up receiving significantly less food. It didn't even come with all items included on the menu (no salad, sauce, or yogurt). I received literally one and a half small chicken drumsticks for the main portion. The taste was decent; I just felt a little swindled out of my money. I wouldn't bother with take out again."
3,"Huge variety of dishes (kebab, falafel)Cheap price - 4 euro for doner.Popular with locals,  not much space to sit inside. Fast service, friendly stuff.You cannot pay by card."
3,"I very much enjoyed my visit to Golden! I was staying at a hotel down the street, and decided I had a taste for Chinese food. Seeing that there was a positively-reviewed place just a short walk away, I decided to get take away and bring it back to my room.The staff was very friendly when I arrived. After a few minutes looking over the menu, I decided on a beef dish that was supposed to be spicy. Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact name of the dish. While I waited, I looked around the restaurant itself which was clean and comfortable, if not a little dark. The food came out relatively quickly, and I walked back to my hotel. Once settled down, I ripped in to the bag and found a lot of food (for the price), and it was very delicious as well! The dish was not very spicy, which was disappointing, but I am used to that - most places are not spicy enough for me.I would certainly return to Golden if I were in the area for the friendly staff, good prices and delicious food."
3,"Looks like a really cool bar, and it was really crowded after 9. I love highball here, basil and New York sour one. But I don't like they allow smoking inside, especially I am not a smoker. When I got home, my hair my clothes my everything smells like cigarettes. Minus one star for that."
2,"This has been on our list to try based on the reviews. Sadly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the sushi. My hubby and I ordered the echtasien Mix II, so we can try a variety of rolls. The platter comes with 2 maki, 2 special rolls, 4 nigiri, 6 sashimi and 2 shrimp tempura. It sounds like a lot but the rolls are rather small and we didn't leave dinner too full, i.e. I could've eaten more. There weren't many choices for the special rolls since they had to be under 9€ for the mix platter. The food came out fast, which was awesome. The quality of fish seemed good, but the rolls fell apart really easily.Our waiter was really nice, the restaurant itself felt warm and cozy even though it is quite big, and it's located in a nice area. It would be a nice place for a date night. The quality and pricing of food was not comparatively better than other sushi restaurants we've been to, though. Perhaps the non-sushi dishes are good, but I don't think I would come back here just for the sushi."
3,"Apparently, Hamburg does have a beach. It's just hiding in the tiki bars.In all seriousness, it's a relaxing place. Chill out with a Mai Tai, get your butt in a lounge chair, take your shoes off and get them into that sand. On a sunny day, just ignore the container ships going by and you've got yourself an oasis."
2,"1. homeless could come in to beg for food while you are eating ( so environment is bad) 2. food quality --- bad ( I'm Asian, so maybe I'm too strict on the taste.) 3. cheap --- so I still go there from time to time. When it get better, I will reverse my review :)"
4,"The ""Hamburger Rathaus"" is really impressive ! We can see it from far away.I just loved its architecture, particulary its roof with blue tiles.Unfortunately, I didn't had the chance to visit the interior."
4,"Classy, great seafood. Really good restaurant serving some fish specialities from Hamburg."
4,"We were here with my Chinese in-laws, to give them a first impression of German food. so it was not the easiest for any restaurant to please us. However ""Goldene Gans"" managed to make us happy. It was crowded, but luckily they have a very nice back section, which I did not know about. So the restaurant is a good deal larger than it appears at first sight. The service was perfect and was not uncomfortable by a mixed language group (In-laws speak neither English nor German). The waiter handled everything graciously, brought the baby-chair for our little one (as soon as it was free) without the need for a reminder. Sharing dishes so everybody gets to try everything was no problem either an de got extra knifes and forks. We had deer, pork, Zander and trout. All tasted very good."
4,"We found La Trattoria on Yelp, and decided to drive over for a Saturday lunch outing. It was a rainy summer day, but the restaurant was open to the air, and an awning covered a few tables that were outside on the sidewalk.La Trattoria has a fairly standard bound Italian restaurant menu (antipasti, pastas, pizzas), then they have a chalkboard of what must be seasonal specials (or just recommendations) for lunch, and then there's a second chalkboard of daily specials. The waiter (who seemed like he must also be the manager) was friendly and got us a seat right away, tried a few jokes with our daughter, and was patient explaining the options.My wife had the cheese-filled ravioli with truffle cream sauce, which was excellent. There were seven or eight good-sized ravioli filled with some kind of firm-ish cheese, and covered in a very decadent truffle cream sauce. I ordered the daily special of chanterelles in a cream sauce over homemade papardelle; it was incredibly good. Lots of mushrooms, good portion size, and tons of flavor in every bite. Being six, our daughter ordered spaghetti with tomato sauce, and managed to eat about half of the giant ""kids"" portion (which she finished with gusto at home the next day).We also ordered tiramisu and tartufo for dessert. The tartufo was just okay, but the tiramisu was quite good. Overall, we loved our experience here, and will definitely be back."
3,Impressive and great to see such diverse and exotic animals such as sharks and crocodiles in Hamburg. It is rather expensive so it requires a separate visit to the Tierpark.
4,"A MUST for a visitor in Hamburg ist the City-Hall. Build in the end of the 19th century it was to be a monument against NOBILITY. Hamburg was to become ONE with the German EMPIRE under the rule of emperor Wilhelm II.Almost all other parts of Germany were Kingdoms, ruled by Kings, Dukes and Earls. Hamburg was a free city, ruled by merchands. It was incredibly important for Hamburg's political society to make a statement. HAMBURG is level with NOBILITY. The city build a townhall to conquer all questions. 11 years of building time, countless people, who took influence. A decade, in which art was turned upside-down. ... Lost documentary, almost 700 rooms... This building is sooo incredible, so unknown yet ... a MUST-SEE."
4,"I've been to Ti Breizh a few times now and once again, it was absolutely delicious. Generally, I nosedive in the direction of all things sweet but I can't get enough of the savory menu here. The L'envie is my favorite galette on the menu. Pro tip: if you have more than 4 in your group, make a reservation. If you are more than 2 and don't like to wait, I also suggest making a reservation."
4,"This is a great place to go to if you want to see loads of sharks and other wild animals but my experience was pretty differant as i was there for Qype's 5th Birthday which was amazing.The hospitality was good as it was a champagne reception and nice food, but as the night went on it got better but maybe it was due to the unlimited bar tab lol but i would definatly go back and take my son for the sharks and other wild life."
3,"Nice cozy restaurant featuring Franconian cuisine and drinks.Pros: Friendly, multi-lingual staff with English menusPet friendlyCons: Pet friendly"
4,"The best bar on Hamburger Berg- Rosis is similar to many of the other ""dive"" bars aufm Kiez but it has a special something going on for it which seperates it from the rest of the bars around here. Is is the drinks? Nah, an Astra here costs pretty much the same in every bar near the Reeperbahn. Just dont get caught drinking any other beer. Could it be the atmosphere? Maybe- the wood interior with paintings and lamps straight out of the 60s and 70s certainly lend this place some character. The foosball table and couch also add nice distractions when you dont want to dance. Oh, now that I mention it, its the dancing! People here just want to dance, dance, dance. The DJ on Thursday/weekends is likely spinning old soul 45s (think James Brown) and everyone just gets down, in an unpretentious way. The crowd here is totally not an ""Im here-to-be-seen"" scene. My stand-by when it comes to a night out aufm Kiez. Check it out."
3,I am not normally a fan of places like this but I have to say that my fist visit to Sausalitos was more than pleasant! It seems to be a great after work place that has become adept at making sure groups of friends can enjoy an after work cocktail (half price until 8pm) and some tasty mexican food. The atmosphere is buzzy and the music cranks up a bit later in the evening (maybe that was the strange looking blue cocktail I had?) The service is swift and friendly an nothing seemed to be too much trouble. I will be going back soon to try the extra stron Chilli!
4,"Brilliant. Very impressed with this place. Had a lovely lamb steak with a honey-mustard sauce and figs. Very reasonably priced, stylish and friendly. The place was full on a Monday evening  that says everything."
4,"Bock Treffpunkt Imbiss has been described to be as ""the place where vegetarians eat meat, where non-smokers smoke and where atheists come to pray.""It's that good. I ordered the köttbullar and the dish managed to exceed my already high expectations. I thought the sauteed mushrooms in the sauce was a nice touch as well. It really brought together all of the flavours. Post meal, we were offered a choice of dessert. I went with the chocolate pudding and custard. This was hands down the best köttbullar that I've had in Hamburg, yet.It's quite the interesting little setup as well -- underneath a tent. Very cozy and not the least bit cold in Winter as it is heated."
2,"I was in Hamburg for work and was brought here by a local who seemed to eat there regularly. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was what you expect from an expensive Italian Restaurant. One weird thing was the only English menu on offer was on a giant chalk board. A waiter brought it round and we had to choose there and then. It was different, but fine and had no negative impact on our experience. The food I chose was very good. I had Dover sole that was really tasty and then at the end we shared a huge plate with one of each of their desserts in it. Again it was very nice. If you like Italian food then this place will probably appeal to you. Just be aware it was also on the pricey side."
3,"Brought you the world by the same people as over in Peacestanbul, Mr Kebab is a friendly warm place for friends and colleagues to meet over a good hearty place of delicious mediterranean influenced food. Yes you can get the obligatory Döner kebab but they also have a range of specials to satisfy all tastes. Good for lunch, and fun / cool in the evenings. A nice place to go!"
2,"Well, what can I say? Borcher's is the place you went to in the 80s when you were fed up with all that neon shit.In exchange you got some tavern-like wood furniture, with lame and boring folks.Nothing no changed here since the 80s. Even the music - I mean: SOLID AS A ROCK blaring from the speakers. C'mon, seriously?Hadn't tastes other than their home brewed beer, which is okay."
3,"Got here close to when they opened and one of the wait staff members informed me that the kitchen was still preparing and that I couldn't order just yet but I was welcome to wait in the restaurant.I didn't mind the wait and everyone was very nice. After about 20 or 30 min, the waitress came by and took my order and my noodle soup came out at a reasonable time. An hour past after they opened and I could tell this is a popular lunch spot as the place was filling up very quickly so be here to get here early to avoid the lunch rush.The menu changes frequently and while they do have a menu with some staples, seems like everyone is looking at their specials board that changes everyday I believe. I ordered off the specials board - noodle soup.The noodle soup was really great! Had a lot of great flavors and on a cold day, this helped to warm me up! I love the vibe of this place! The staff is super friendly and they have a great lunch selection that will please your taste buds.I will be sure to come back to try more!"
3,'raw like sushi' offers a great choice of sushi and bentos besides having lovely deserts. Important: the sushi not just standard maki & co but somewhat creative! These facts and the good atmosphere make this place a good alternative to the growing number of sushi place in Hamburg and is definitely worth a try.
4,"War etwas skeptisch ob der stylischen Einrichtung, ungewöhnlich für einen türkischen Imbiss, dient aber nur zum weiteren Wohlfühlen. Superlecker das Essen, frisch. Irre nett und gastfreundschaftlich der Laden. Optimales Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Da gehich bestimmt noch mehrmals hin."
4,Great small and cozy place. Love the food and the service. Very nice couple. Details show they care.
3,"This place was great. In the lovely Portuguese quarter. The pizza we had was delicious, and the service was nice."
3,"I've had decent lunches at Billy The Butcher a couple of times now. It's what I would describe as a trendy burger joint on the 4th floor of the Alsterhaus department store. The idea is that the meat is high-quality, the food is straightforward, and the service is friendly. I think all of those are accurate.The menu is short (a good thing), with a choice of about four beef burgers, one chicken burger, and one veggie burger. There's also a beef tartare option if you're uncomfortable with any heat applied to your meat. I've always ordered the cheeseburger, and in my opinion it's good. They offer ""medium"" and ""well done"" for the beef burgers, and ""medium"" is consistently what I would call medium-rare in the US (which I'm happy about).You can't get a burger without fries, and their fries are pretty tasty. Lately the standard serving is a mixture of potato and sweet potato (I think this is new), but they're reliably good. You have to pay extra for any sauces/condiments, which is unfortunately too typical. The part that's even more dismaying is that the tiny cups of mayo are 1 Euro each. I mean, if you're going to charge me a Euro for mayonnaise, at least give me my money's worth.They also serve classic cocktails in the evening, along with beer and wine. I've never attended, but it would make a classy but low-key place to have a drink with a friend after work."
1,"I've been to many dim sum restaurants, including those in China, but this one missed the mark. The choices are quite limited and the taste of the dishes are ok-ish. The vegan buddharol for example was really chewy and greasy, instead of being crispy. The other dim sums were ok, but a bit on the small side. We also ordered fried noodles with Cha Sieuw, only there was not enough meat in the dish... the staff was constantly checking on you whether you are finished eating or drinking, which gave the diner a 'fast-food' feeling. The paent could only be done with cash or credit card, they didn't accept (EU) Maestro cards... Hamburg really needs a Chinatown."
4,Fabulous Korean restaurant in Hamburg.  I am very familiar with Korean food.  Love the spice.  Especially love Yook Hwe.  Their version is excellent.  Restaurant was quite full for a Monday night & after eating there I understand why.  One thing- please develop an English menu.  That would be very helpful.  You can do only so much using Google translate.
4,Fresh produce and many environmentally friendly options. Slightly pricier but worth the cost for the high quality.
4,"What a great little cafe. Just stumbled upon it today with an acquaintance who recommended we stop in for an espresso. We ended up having a piece of homemade cake and this was fantastic. The majority of things sold here homemade and everything looks spectacular. The primary goal of the place is to sell tidewood but I think they do more business as a cafe. If you can find it, definately make sure to stop in. Although we had very little to do with the service personnel, it seems like everyone there was really nice. People were also hanging out there during the middle of the day, in a workweek. Seems like an awesome place to stop in for a coffee and just enjoy time passing by."
4,"Sometimes the popularity of this place annoys me, but that's only ever on Friday and Saturday evenings. At all other times it's really cool to have a bar that's always bustling. It's a pretty simple concept. Great lighting, comfortable seats, good drinks, handy location."
4,"This place is suburb!  We were trudging back to our hotel after 5 hours on our feet. We would have eaten anywhere!  I thought it was just going to be a run-of-the-mill cafe. It is so much more!  My husband had, what he now considers, one of the best dishes in his life!  He ordered a linguine with cherry tomatoes, onions, steak in a Parmesan cream sauce. I loved my dish also, pappardelle (obviously homemade) with crab and large shrimp in a saffron based sauce. Terrific!  Also they delivered a wonderful amuse bouche of a small bowl of a cauliflower soup that was fantastic.  This place is out if the way, but out of this world. ( it was around 44 euro for two entrees and two drinks)"
4,"This really is an exceptional bar.  It is neighborhoody, unpretentious, but every aspect is just a step above.  The beer selection is fine (in an old-school, non-craft-beer-aficianado sense).  The outdoor seats let you settle back and reflect, and the indoor spots are pleasantly nooky.  The servers are keen, able, and cool.   A great place to hang."
4,"Very good restaurant, a little price for a tasty food. Ask their noodles if you don't have too much ideas."
3,"Since I normally don't enjoy the kind of Chinese food you get served throughout Germany (keywords: heartburn or glutamate) this place here is a positive exception.Starting off with the amazing cleanliness of tablecloth and furniture: No sauce spots or spilt soy sauce like one is often used to. Besides staff here are friendly and stunningly quick. Their menu consists of different (regional) Chinese specialities, however, prepared differently. Maybe in an affectionate way - or just made with real expertise. Prawns, fish, meat and veg all just close to being perfect: veg being al dente, the meat tender, the seabream crispy and the sauces very well/naturally flavoured. The food is different from the usual Chinese stuff in 2 ways:the creative recipes and the meals' way of presentation. Beautiful! And if you are into the crazy-shaped, carved carrots that suddenly have turned into swans, a pagoda or a whatever bird then this is paradise for you. So prices are obvisouly quite a bit higher than the Chinese take-away's around the corner but it's definitely worth the way over to this spacious restaurant. Recommended!"
3,"Having moved recently near to this location we finally were able to try it out. I had heard of the place fairly soon after it opened but the opportunity to visit simply didn't present itself. Well, now it had.There has been enough written about this location in German so I won't go into too many specifics. High-end location with lots of windows. Modern design with well spaced out tables. I found the ambiance and seating comfortable. Service was top notch while we were there and everyone who came by out table was extremely professional. The food itself was also top notch. We had sushi and everything was of the best quality and very well prepared. I liked the selection and found the prices to be representative of the quality as well as area. Yes, it's kind of expensive but what do you expect in Eppendorf and when it's Henssler? All in all, a very good experience and we'll be back. I left out one star simply because this place does lack a bit of soul. It's definitely all good in terms of food, service, location etc. but somehow I didn't get the feeling that this is place which will have lots of regulars and will be used as a ""hang out"" for the inside crowd. Somehow Steffen's place down by the docks has a better vibe to it (be that vibe good or bad). Ono just hasn't come into it's own at this point. Maybe it will and if so, I will update my review. Until then, I am looking forward to grabbing sushi here again soon."
4,"I try to visit HH at least once a year and Mo-Grill is always one of my first stops after I get to the city. Of course, we all know from reading ""The Invention of Curried Sausage"" novella by Uwe Timm that Currywurst was first created in Hamburg and the claims by Berlin are quatsch. The food at Mo-Grill is great -- served fast and hot by friendly folks and their expansion has not affected the quality. There's also a peculiar Hamburg ambiance with everyone standing around small tables eating with lots of people walking past. Nothing like it anywhere else!"
4,"I've walked past this place at lunch time, and there's always a line out the door. I finally tried it today, and wow!! Excellent tasting ice cream. Very very fresh. You should go here if you're in the area and looking for dessert!"
4,Best Döner in Hamburg !
3,"I love their lunch meals. I go from time to time with my work colleagues and we enjoy the meals there. Normally I order a meal which consists of fried mixed vegetables, rice and kebab meat. The value for the price is great."
2,"Good quality which doesn't go together with service. Pity. The coffee is ok, but very light. Delicious selection for breakfast"
4,"Very very good burrito. Dead friendly staff, quick service, delicious burritos and good beer. Only slight criticism is the lack of cheese topping, but can't fault them on the filling. Good price too. I'm definitely becoming a regular. Going to have to try the steak burrito pretty damn soon."
3,"Trude has a very nice location, next to the museum of labor. It is still very close to the Barmbek Station. The staff is very nice and the drinks are good. I didn't try the food, but the menu has a variety of dishes. On the menu there are different explanations/options for the name ""TRUDE"".The entrance is even with the ground."
3,"This was an interesting and educational way to spend two hours on a rainy day in Hamburg. We did the tour which includes decorating your own chocolate bar, learning about the process of chocolate from the raw cocoa pods and importing and then how it's turned into the delicious chocolate at the end. Our tour guide spoke terrific English (check their schedule for what languages are toured at what times) and it was quite educational.Of course, there's a huge chocolate gift shop at the end and how can you not buy a bunch of interesting edible and decorative items to bring home?Expect to eat some chocolate along the way, so don't be too stuffed when you arrive.[Review 12058 overall, 1841 of 2019.]"
3,"I really fancy this place! It is so typical Eimsbüttel! Be it for brunch or dinner, prices are proportional to the quality. Wine offer is short but good. Inventive dishes based on a classical menu with fresh seasonal products, excellent attentive service and the kind of crowd needed for Sunday night after sports. I just had Seeteufel, perfectly cooked served with tomatoes filled with ratatouille: delicious and beautiful! Otherwise the big salad with tuna fish is great as a reasonable dinner. Enjoy sitting outside if the weather allows it, and watch Eimsbüttel life around you.Avoid the pasta, on a second thought, apart from pasta with shrimps, I've eaten better pasta in my life But I can be pretty picky.English spoken, but not a surprise for the whole neighbourhood."
4,"Hard to believe, but Altona and Hamburg were two rivals. Now Altona is part of Hamburg (a nice, charismatic part), but I guess there still was a need to have its own museum. And I must say, well done guys! Small, but very informative museum, revolving around Elbe and everything which comes with it: shipbuilding, whaling(thank God it's in the past), fishery, sea trade, port and so on. A message is clear: the river is a key to regions past and the future. There's a beautiful collection of figureheads occupying the whole room. Also a hall dedicated to Schleswig-Holstein, Helgoland island in particular. This museum is very similar to  surprise Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (Hamburg Museum), but smaller. It has a few things, which its bigger brother doesn't have: the whole interactive section dedicated to kids - Kinderolymp and a restaurant, Vierländer Kater, a house in the house, replicating typical Northen German tavern of 18th century. The restaurant itself worth visiting, great concept!"
3,"I had lunch here today and immensely enjoyed it. The quality of the seafood is excellent and they cook it very well. My Pfannfisch (which I was told was a local Hamburg dish) with pan fried potatoes and a mustard sauce was excellent. Light fluffy and flaky fish with excellent potatoes and the sauce was also quite tasty (missing a bit of intensity for a mustard sauce). My oyster entree was also great and fresh. It was a bit expensive at €21 for 6 oysters but I had to try it as I have not had any oysters since arriving in Germany :-) I think I will keep looking for good oysters but it is not easy to find.This place is certainly not cheap and lunch for two with two courses and mineral water was around €80. I think you pay for the view here which many of the restaurants in the area do not have.I would come back here for the seafood but will explore loads of other places nearby also, that serve seafood (there is a line of seafood restaurants in this area so you have plenty of choice)."
4,"Beatiful setting/atmosphere and the food was outstanding!  Just make sure you read German or go with someone who does because they do not have an English Menu and the Waiters did not speak much English.  The seafood, salads and desserts were not only incredible to look at but were equally incredible to eat. Highly recommend."
0,"A place that calls it self CHICAGO MEATPACKER and just offers 3 american beers (and 3 standard beers at that) seems like a rip off wrapped up in an US theme to me.Haven't had food there, because the beer experience was enough already."
4,"It is difficult when you traveling to Europe for business trip-this place is very, very good and so perfect."
4,"The staff is extremely friendly, the atmosphere transports you to the streets of Italy and the coffee and food are great too! It does not get any better. ** They only accept cards for orders over 10 euro (found that out the hard way - but they were nice enough to allow me to come back later to pay for my cappuccino!)"
3,Love this place. Love the wall paper. Love the free mini Lucky Strike matches. Love the music. Came here once a bit too early I think about 11pm (although that's quite late for an English person!) and it was really quiet and my boyfriend fell asleep But when this place is packed it's definitely one of the best places in the city to go.
4,"When I first visited HafenBahnhof I was living in St Pauli and quite new to Hamburg - it felt like a very long trip to get there and back. I haven't been back in a long time, but with my now much-more-substantial knowledge of Hamburg, it doesn't feel so far away - especially if you happen to live in Altona or own a bike (cycling around Hamburg is easy). The bar itself is sort of like a big shed (see the photos). They have a small stage at one end for bands, which is actually the only reason that I've ever visited!"
4,"I can't believe I've missed this little gem for so long! Meine kleinraumdisko is a deceptively tardis-like bar/club just opposite the REAL supermarket by Feldstrasse U-bahn. Low key beats being mixed at conversational volume, cool sofas in a number of corners, trippy visuals on projected on the walls, and Augustina beer for 3 euros (which doesn't give you an Astra-style hangover of death) make it a compelling destination! I'll definitely be spending a lot more time here."
3,We arrived Hamburg at noon and decide to get some burgers before going to the office. This place is pretty close to the city hall and rated well.I ordered the steak burger and fries and they both taste good. But the place is very hard to find since it's located in a food court in a shopping mall.
3,"their cheesecake is really great.the way steaks are cooked, also excellent. the medium-rare was juicy and soft.only thing I missed was kid's menu."
3,We had shoyu ramen and miso ramen and they all tasted very good. The shop was very clean with friendly staff and warm atmosphere. I would like to come back to try other flavors such as butter corn or special shoyu ramen. The taste was quite close to what I had in Japan. I wish they have tonkotsu ramen as well.
4,"The best burger's restaurant, I've ever been. Burger was delicious had a lot of ingredients and perfect grilled meat."
4,The best cafe in Hamburg!:) I love and miss that place! I lived in Hamburg for almost 9 years! The owners are a french and the service is very friendly. It's a cute small cafe in Hamburg Winterhude. It's very cozy. They have the best quiche I've ever eaten in my life! The cofffe is perfect and you have to try the Marabou chocolate pie! OMG! I always go there when I visit Hamburg!
2,"I went with a friend of mine that I haven't seen for years to have a dinner there, he told me that the pizza there is just out of this world. The place was a bit crowded on Friday evening, it took around 5 minuets to get seated which was fine. The waitress came and took our order and she was really nice. We ordered shrimps with garlic pizza which tasted fantastic. I was actually shocked by how big the pizza is over there.The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because my friend was drinking from a glass that was broken and he got his lips cut, and when they replaced the glass, the new glass was also broken. I believe they have to pay some extra attention to that.Overall, the restaurant is a one that I would recommend, but unfortunately we had this problem over there."
4,"When I first came here just over a year ago I was shocked that such a place existed in Hamburg. It's really great, but I can't imagine coming here much more than once a year.. playing sports in soft sand is just too tiring! Both of my visits here have been for a beach football competition. The first time I was injured and so hung around drinking beer all day. More recently (last weekend) I was playing and I'm still feeling the pain. Beach football is dangerous! Still, it's a great asset for Hamburg to have such a facility."
2,This place has a nice laid back atmosphere and solid drinks. The food is good and the staff was nice. A nice place to spend the summer-evening with friends.
4,Great experience and great food. Would recommend. Get the tasting menu! Reasonable compared to other places. Not pretentious.
4,"I absolutely love this place. It's like the definition of hipster. It's. So. Trendy. Looks exactly like the stuff my designer ex-flatmate produced. (And he was really talented, so that's a compliment.)And they definitely know their coffee too! There's not only coffee from most parts of the world; once you start talking to the owners (I think?) about coffee, they just go full on passion lecture mode on you. In a good way.If you like coffee, I'd seriously recommend going here with a friend (special or regular kind) and  do a coffee tasting. Owner recommended trying out the same beans as espresso and regular coffee to spot the difference. And then there's of course different kinds of beans with different kinds of roasts.........Sounds like a pretty great pass-time to me.  Well, if you like coffee that is."
3,"A very trendy place. A big plus is that they have homemade patties and you can choose what kind of bun you want. I whish that the patties tasted a bit more tho. They are in need of salt and peppar. I have only had take-away and the concept is great! You choose your type of burger, then buns and side orders and when we waited for the food we got free beverages. I have never eaten at the restauran but I would say it is worth a pop-in."
4,"Great little lunchtime venue with a superb value set menu option. Choose anything you like from the mains, plus a selection of delicious starters, and a desert for EUR7.50. Everybody finished what they ordered, and the food tasted fresh and healthy. Lots of salad, dressing... all that good stuff. On the downside - it's extremely dark in here for lunch - but then, Hamburg is quite dark at the moment, and, they didn't have the lamb because it was sold out. Probably a victim of tasting too nice. Try this place."
3,"I love a good dive burger place, and this place is really awesome! Came here for dinner and the place was packed, the hostess said that there were no tables available but the bar area was first come first served. There was plenty of room at the bar so it was easy for us to find seats. Immediately we looked at their chalkboard for their angry hour specials. Hehe, not happy but angry hour. There was a special for buy one get one free for the tap beer which we obviously ordered. Then we saw napalm wings for 25 cents each. We love hot wings so we of course did a half order of that. For the burgers, I went with a plain one as the burgers looked pretty massive and there was plenty of mayo and ketchup on the bar top for me to sauce it up if I needed to.For our drinks we ordered a couple rounds of the ratsheern red beer. It's a good light beer and I needed a couple of glasses once the napalm wings came around. When we ordered the napalm wings, our waitress warned us that it was spicy, we said. 'ja, we know'. Then she proceeds, 'No, IT'S REALLY SPICY!"" lol We were foolish and said, 'ja we like spicy!'. The waitress said ok.... and out came the wings! They were in a dry habanero sauce with a side of blue cheese dressing and some carrots. We took one bite and our lips were on fire. ok yeah.... napalm wings are REALLY SPICY! The flavor of the wings were still really good but I think I cried a little! So be careful when ordering the wings. It's a great deal when they are 25 cents but I'm really glad we only had 3 each. I could not finish 6 or a dozen!Ok, as my mouth was on fire, my burger arrived with a heaping pile of fries. I dove into the fries and couldn't really taste anything but burning. After the napalm wings heat subsided, I finally was able to eat my burger which was really juicy and delicious! I love how the english muffin soak up the burger flavor and I was able to eat the whole thing without a fork and knife :) Overall, it's a great place for great messy burgers! The staff is super friendly and were happy to speak to us in english or german. I insisted on german since I'm still learning and the waitstaff was patient with me and my shitty german :)Will be back for the burgers and I still need to try that cheesecake!"
2,"Hier habe ich öfter ein kleines Frühstück genossen oder auf die schnelle ein Kaffee. Jedes Mal fand ich die Bedienung SEHR freundlich und hilfsbereit, das Essen schmeckte, und die Einrichtung finde ich nett und atmosphärisch. Leider habe ich heute die Minestrone bestellt.Die Suppe war dünn, und hell Braun mit kleine, oben-schwimmende Fettaugen. Grundsätzlich habe ich nichts gegen Fettaugen, wenn sie zum Geschmack beitragen. Nur diese Brühe hatte leider keinen Geschmack. Die bunten Zucchini Würfeln und sehr wenige Bohnen und Weißkohl Streifen konnten alleine die Braune Brühe nicht zum Leben erwachen. Knoblauch?  Fehlanzeige, Pfeffer?  Fehlanzeige, Salz?  usw. Seltsam finde ich es, dass die Brühe Braun war, und scheinbar nichts (Geschmacklich) mit dem Gemüse zu tun hatte.Nein, ich habe mich nicht Vorort beschwert aus dem einfachen Grund, dass ich wenig Zeit hatte und gar keine Lust hatte auf ein Grundsatzdiskussion über der Definition von Minestrone, und verschiede kulinarische Interpretationen davon.Das Erlebnis heute war enttäuschend. Ich hoffe, dass Engelke beim nächsten Besuch besseres zu bieten hat."
3,"Whoa! Their pizza is HUGE. Luigis is such a cute little restaurant. it's a nice mix of cozy and hip. We had two glasses of red wine, a hot tea, a carbonara classico and pizza parma all for 40 euros. Amazing. I thought their carbonara was really good and it's nice without the sauce. It seems like they use fresh noodles here as well. The pizza parma had arugula and ham on it and it was pretty damn good too. Cheap, delicious, and I will be back."
4,"Best Restaurant in Hamburg. Food is amazing and the staff is great. The Mezze offers different starters every time, and the rack of lamb is delicious time and time again."
1,"Balutschistan was another destination on the quest to find a half-decent curry in Germany. Sadly, I came out wishing I'd asked them to ignore the menu and just cook something they'd eat, not a pale watered-down German version, but I didn't, and that's what I got. The service was unfriendly, it was quite pricey, and the food arrived disturbingly quickly. It's not cooked to order! I wouldn't really rush to get back in here."
2,"Toiled password protected! You will find out that only when you come to it, no tip or any other message. And I'm not that kind of person that keeps receipt:/ got in just because a guy was leaving But coffee is good though expensive. I'd suggest to hang at least a notice at the way to the rest room :/"
3,"I have been to Hamburg so many times that I thought I knew the city.Apparently, I can't be further away from being wrong. This museum - that is located on beautiful park with idyllic lake teaches you all about Hamburg and its history. It's located not far from U-bahn stop St. Pauli, so it can't get any easier than that, not to mention it's not far should you be interested to check out all the ""interesting"" entertainment on the infamous Reeperbahn.Again, dragged by my history and museum geek boyfriend, I came here by force (if not by free will) although I wasn't literally kicking and screaming. If it were up to me, I'd rather spend my time at Monckebergstrasse, but oh well - I guess a little history won't hurt.This museum has very interesting models of pretty much everything in Hamburg. At least you won't be bored by history by looking at interesting teeny weeny intricate models. It taught you what Hamburg really was back then when some Christian missionaries (and bishops) chose to settle here and named the town Hammaburg. It's almost like reading it on wikipedia, but with a lot of cute models. See? not boring.The layout of the museum was cool too and they had a room full of model ships just like in Copenhagen's Orlogsmuseet, and the most cool about this museum is that on the top floor, they have a working railway model of Hamburg in the scale of 1:32. That was amazing to watch. They did have people operating the trains and all. I felt like I went back to my childhood again.On the basement floor they had small exhibition of what Hamburg was like under Nazi reign, along with recreation of shops, places under World War II. Very interesting.All in all, a very interesting place to visit, especially if you're interested about history....and oh, did you know that Reeperbahn literally means the rope way? It's where back in the yore they made ropes for the ships. See? More knowledge of history here! I'm getting like 1% smarter than before... :P"
4,"A small ""fast-food"" restaurant with a great flair and delicious Burritos (also very spicy if you want though)! I can only recommend to go there, but be careful : you have to pick a good moment because it is really often full and you will have to wait a little bit..."
3,"I visit green lovers every few weeks for a salad lunch. They have a handful of predetermined salad recipes to choose from, or you can choose your own adventure with several dozen salad toppings available. They also serve some soups and curries, and a handful of sandwich options. My favorite salad is the Nordisch by Nature, which includes cucumbers, radishes, spring onions, and smoked salmon over lettuce, with a creamy yogurt dressing and a sprinkle of mustard sauce. I've also tried the chicken sesame salad, which was okay but not great. All of the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared, and the staff is friendly. If you get there at peak lunch time (12:30-1:00), there will probably be a queue of 5-10 people waiting to place their orders, but things move pretty quickly, and you can order salads to eat in or take away."
4,My favorite place to eat in Hamburg. Lovely and quiet. Amazing food and you can feel the devotion from the two owners. Book in advance as it is only a small place.
3,This is a pretty decent place close to the Qype HQ. They offer various pasta and antipasti. I had pasta with spinach cream sauce and that was tasty! Order right at the counter when you walk into this place.
4,"Das Piment ist ein sehr kleines nettes Restaurant in Eppendorf und wohl eines des besten Restaurants, in denen wir je gegessen haben.Es ist leider nie viel los im Piment, das mag aber auch an den Preisen liegen.Das Essen ist hervorragend genau wie der Service und wir waren nun schon einige Male hier und es gab nie auch nur die kleinste Beanstandung.Sehr nette Kreationen und fuer diejenigen, die gerne mal etwas Neues ausprobieren, ist das genau der richtige Ort. 5 Sterne fuer ein perfektes Restaurant"
3,"The ambience is very nice, but the food is a bit bland, compared to other vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. But everything is very fresh and nicely served. On Saturday at lunch the place was crowded, people were even waiting outside to get a seat."
1,"I'm mean really guys- 4 beers two burgers and some Nachos = €75 or something - really...?Burger were OK - Buns were a disgrace , Nachos - Good!- Staff had to be reminded three times of the empty beer glasses and a new order  !-but they were friendly!I'm travelling world wide - always end up in some hard rock cafe, since all the folks find it sooo cool - LAME!Hey, they played German Electro beats at the Hardrock cafe Hamburg - That has NOTHING to do with Hard Rock - play Rock - or actually Hard Rock, hence the name-Only tourists - not one person from HH in there.Just a big corporation trying to sell some shirts for € 20-40 a pop- Nothing to see here , move on!"
3,"Are there any beach clubs in the UK? By way of explanation, a beach club is an outdoor bar with a layer of sand across the floor to make it like a beach. Most of these bars are next to rivers or lakes, but not always. Anyway Strand Pauli is the most permanent and generally the closest beach club to the Reeperbahn. The pluses are that the atmosphere is always cool, the seating is good and the view is interesting (so long as you like shipping). The main minus is that the sand is dirty and full of cigarette butts. The beer is kinda expensive, but cheaper than the other beach clubs."
4,"Excellent food, very special action. This is a unique experience! Never had a better experience in a fish restaurant!After a few days here is a little more detailed review:We arrived at Casa Franco and got an ""dude"" welcome. We were placed in the middle of the restaurant and it seemed uncomfortable at the beginning. My wife and me got seated at a 6 seater with just one couple with us. The tender told us, that he is the menu tonite, so we don't need to read. Decision was easy: he asked us if we want fish, meat or vegetarian. We decided to go with the fish menu. As start we got olives with tasty bread and kind of mayonnaise-garlic sauce. After a while the flambed scampi arrived and that was a big start!! The second course was a super tasty mix of tuna and pike-perch fish. This was the time we realized that everybody in the room took the fish menu - and they started to serve the courses simultaneously. After the second course they served a shot for everybody with general salut! After a while one of the tenders showed up with the next course - in raw format. It was a loach and a kind of a big fish! Meanwhile a guitar singer walked through the room and gave us a big Portuguese feeling with singing pretty good and impulsive!The third course arrived and that was a big one! The Loach of course and a super tasty sword-fish we're served with tasty vegetable. Each fish got his own sauce (as with every course) and it was great! The dessert was good and after that another shot arrived. Each course and shot was announced once to the entire audience.With all that, we experienced a great dinner with a feeling of being big friends to guest at friends! While leaving every women got a rose as gift and after talking to the manager and thanking big for the great dinner, he passed a bottle of Rioja to me.Thank you ""Casa Franco"" team for this unique experience! We will definitely come back!Addendum: when arriving you might think ""WTF"" but don't judge on this - this one is one of the best fish restaurants I've ever bin."
4,Came across this quaint gem and stopped with my family - we loved every dish that we ordered. All the food was beautifully balanced and flavorful with the perfect amount of spice or complement. My favorite was the Chicken Panang Curry with a personal pot of Jasmine Tea. Highly recommend this place for a low key evening dinner with friends or family.
3,"The Rathaus is a pretty magnificent building right in the heart of Hamburg. You can just wander in off the street. Definitely a must see for visitors to the city, shame I don't know much about the place other than it's impressive. My only niggle with the place is the current exhibition they're running; although I personally don't have anything against it, I think perhaps it's a bit overt for children? So maybe if you're there as a family you might want to check it out before taking them in."
3,Hands down Hamburg's currywurst beats Berlin's. The juicy sausage is packed with flavor and has the perfect snap as you bite into it.  Curry powder was flawless and not too overpowering - it was unforgettably mouthwatering and conveniently located in the most charming little city!
4,"Less than two weeks ago we celebrated our wedding day at the Parlament's private room  the magnificent Rose Room. There aren't enough words or pictures to describe the beauty of the room. Please, try and go there and see for yourself, when we first went to see it our jaws dropped, we knew right away that that's the place we want for our wedding. It is an elegant, classic, ancient room that makes you feel in a fairy tale. From the info page: The Rose is the room in Parlament most steeped in history. Kings and ministers were received here and the daughters of Hamburg ship owners were married here. An impressive feature is the filigree ceiling painting and the imposing chandeliers. Being a sailor's daughter, this was perfect. But that's not all! We were looking not just for pure beauty, but also for a special place, for a small family and close friends celebration that will be able to provide us a vegan buffet (ya ya, vegan people get married too). The first step was to contact the lady who's in charge for private events, and wow, Mrs. Casper was absolutely amazing. She was super professional, friendly, available at any time, and the perfect person to count on for such a special day. All our special requests were fulfilled, the chef created a state of the art vegan buffet (all the guests were NOT vegan and were shocked and happy and thrilled realizing how tasty and rich the food was), the tables were set the way we wanted with our artistic cards flowers and funky confetti and our balloons hovered around, making the room even more festive at the end of the event we all went outside and send the balloons to the sky. The Rose Room and the Parlament staff contributed a great deal to the success of our day. We are grateful! Bottom line: if you are looking for a WOW place, professional staff, special menu and the best location in town  this is your place!"
4,"Authentic Italian restaurant that is said to be frequented by celebrities also. Wouldn't have wondered if I had met the Godfather himself there. You won't get served pizza, but tasty antipasti, pasta, and tiramisu. Luckily I didn't have to pay the bill!"
3,"My girlfriend is a chocolate lover, so when she visited Hamburg we knew we had to visit this museum.As with anything, it is all about expectations. We come from Costa Rica, a cocoa-producing country, so we knew that maybe our minds were not going to be exploted with new exciting information, but we wanted to have a different view of how chocolate is percieved in other countries, and of course.. eat some chocolate! And that we did!Regarding the language, we got there on a Sunday afternoon, and there were no more English tours available, so we had to go with the German one (I'm learining some, so took it as a challenge). We were offered a written guide in English for EUR 2.5 deposit which covers most of what the guide says. The tour consists of a combination of talks from the guide, hands on chocolate making, and lots of tastings of the cocoa seeds, and chocolate in all of its various stages of production. They guide was very friendly and knowledgeable, and even stayed with us for a while at the end explaning anything in English what we didn't understand. The gift shop is amazing (if you are a chocolate lover) with everything chocolate: choco pasta, choco pesto, choco beers.. you name it. Overall, a great activity for a rainy Sunday afternoon in Hamburg. We definitely recommend it to any chocolate fan."
4,"If you're hungry, don't worry, this place serve you heaps of good food to a great price. Awesome afterwork place for everyone how wanna have something to eat or just a beer."
3,"Potato everything, even menus shaped like smiling potatoes. Food was pretty good, standard German fare. Portions generous and prices quite reasonable. One of the more expensive entrees plus a beer cost under 20 euros. Dark and cosy ambience (Keller means cellar, so most of the restaurant is, you guessed it, in a cellar.)"
3,"We went to Witwenball for a special occasion dinner when some friends visited from out of town. Overall, the space is beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is good. I think my only real complaint is that the pacing of the meal was extremely slow (for my taste)."
4,"I have been there a couple of time with friends visiting Hamburg. It's always been an incredible evening. Franco makes feel at home, but no only. The food is incredible. I cannot recommend enough this place."
4,"Although I had I pretty bad flu since the week before, I couldnt resists to join this event. Even though it appeared to be my first night as the Qype City Night host. So after all I joined the group around twentyhundret-and-a-bit: a bunch of more than 25 heads, that made their way to the GOLDEN, a place being criticized in november last year by myself in a pretty harsh but discussable way. Therefore I was pretty excited how both - the restaurantsowner and the qype community - would reflect on the upcoming event. Bearing a pretty poor stomach for almost a week in mind, I decided to choose from the menu, beginning with a chinese mushroom soup with chicken. Great choise! Delicious and tasty. Then there was some Dim Sums and in the end another shark-fin-soup (what-so-ever the english equivalent may be called). Please refer to both english and german feedbacksregarding the GOLDEN. As I dont like to edit my german comment from november `06, I have to get the GOLDEN five stars and two-thumbs-up from this end. That night was awesome! Thanks to Mr. Wong."
4,"On an early December Sunday,I was fortunate to appreciate this art museum's splendid collection of Renaissance Period paintings by German and Netherlandish painters.German painters with fine Late Gothic and Renaissance Period paintings at this art museum included: Bertram Von Minden(""Altarpiece from ""Harvestehude""),Hinrik Funhof (""Virgin in Robe Decorated With Ears of Corn""),Master Francke((""Christ As Man of Sorrows""),Hans Burgmair the Elder(""Agony in Garden""),Hans Schaufelein(""Nativity"")Barthel Beham(""Vanitas""),Martin Schaffner(""Epitaph of Sebastian Welling""),Lucas Cranach the Elder(""Charity"") and Franz Zimmerman(""Lucretia""),among others.Netherlandish painters from the Renaissance Period with quality paintings included;Marcellis Coffermans,Jan Massys(""Flora"")Jan Provost(""Last Judgement""),Jan Gossaert(""Crucifixion""),and Hans Van Cleve the Third(""Tower of Babel""),among others.Although German and Netherlandish Renaissance Period paintings are emphasized at this art museum,I also saw fine Renaissance Period Italian paintings by Francesco Francia(""Virgin and Child Holding Globe""),Sebastiano di Bartolo Mainardi(""Virgin and Child with John the Baptist""),and Paris Bordone(""Fountain of Bathsheba"").The Kunsthalle's collection of Italian Art is relatively small in comparison to their German,Netherlandish,Dutch,and French paintings.I also appreciated the way the works of Art were arranged,the labeling of works of Art in English for the benefit of foreign visitors,and the helpfulness of its staff."
4,"The falafel wraps here are SO GOOD! I really like how they use real whole vegetable toppings in their wraps instead of stuffing it with cold cabbage or lettuce. Aaaand you can also watch them prepare/cook the falafel balls in front of you, so you know they're fresh. For EUR3,50 you really can't get a better deal. Five stars and two thumbs up!"
3,I think they have great coffee and a good selection of bagels and cakes. Sometimes the bagels don't look that fresh though. The cakes are all very good! You order and pay at the counter and then wait for your order and take it to the table yourself. If they aren't that busy the girls will do that too sometimes. But usually they have a lot to do. They do to-go as well. The Café itself looks a bit rough around the edges. But it's comfy and if you get a window seat it's great to sit and watch the passers by. The back is a bit dark. When it's nice weather you can sit outside too.
4,"DaCaio is my favorite place to eat when I travel to Hamburg.  There is a dish called ""Del Boss"" that is consistently mind blowing and I think about it longingly when I'm far from Hamburg.  Check it out, you don't be disappointed.  Also had the tagliatelle for the first time today at lunch and it too was incredible!  Love it!"
4,"Rating this place and giving it 5 stars is like shooting fish in a barrel.  It's the best place in Hamburg to hang, and luckily it's 10 minutes from me mum's house.  I always say ""I'm heading down to Strandperle"", but in reality I've never hung out at Strandperle, always at Ahoi, because it's breezier, and they have a decent weizenbier on tap.  I've been there in January, when it's just barely above freezing, and all the outdoor tables are full (Hamburgians's love to soak up rays on sunny days;  though if it's over 80 degrees, it tends to be less crowded because they find the heat a bit intolerable).The pizza is pretty good, but I usually just get the tap weissbier.   Getting a table outside in the shade can require some eagle-eyed patience, but you can pretty much always find a place in the sun, or take your drink 25 feet and sit on the sand.Far and away the best way to get there, if you mum doesn't live just up the hill,  is to take the ferry boat (#61 or #62), from Landungsbrucken or the Fischmarkt to Neumühlen/Övelgönne then walk west along the river.  It's part of the public transportation system, so you can travel on the ferry with your day pass,  or you can buy a ticket in the boat from a machine.  If you're up for a swim, there is a public indoor/outdoor swimming pool which is an 8-minute walk from the end stop on the ferry line, Finkenwerder.  (You can also actually swim in the river, off to the left from Ahoi/Strandperle, but the water is kinda brown.)  Then, after a swim, Ahoi/Strandperle is the perfect spot for some après -swim suds."
4,"It was a perfect place to drink a glass of wine leaving work! The selection of wine is really good and huge,  and the location is original, with a lot of flare... I only can recommend it!"
3,"A respectable wine bar. It's not exactly my style, I prefer my wine bars with a bit more flourish and character. If you like the warehouse aesthetic, then this place is for you. The selection was great, the prices weren't too crazy, and the food was delicious. 4/5."
3,"I was hanging out with my freinds and suddenly saw this coffee shop in the another side of the street .The impression of me about it is the concept , which is minimal , bright and cute xD. As i went in , the smells of coffee beans rushed in my noé, so delightfully ! No complaint about the staffs , very gentle and friendly."
3,Ordered the thämer burger with fries and 2 half pints of beers. Can't get better than that!
3,"This place deserves four solid stars for its unbeatable location only: Hirschpark is one of the most enjoyable and pretty parks in Hamburg. And what can be better to take a stroll after fulfilling and hearty brunch on Sunday afternoon! The brunch itself was not outstanding: you will find a standard selection of warm and cold dishes, not too much and not too little. The bread selection was a bit disappointing, with no wholemeal buns selection, to which you get used to so quick while living in Germany. On the other hand a really good selection of deserts. Interior is very old fashioned, you absolutely feel that you are in a traditional Landhaus. Therefore a lot of old customers. Prices are not cheap: you'll pay 19 eur, drinks excluded. Keep in mind that tables for brunch are booked quickly. Would I suggest this place? Yes, if you want a quiet meal, opportunity to chat and no hassle. There was my mom, my boyfriend and me brunching together - now you got the idea :)"
3,"A restaurant full of surprises . The food was good (altho the pork chops felt a little bit overcooked, were pretty chewable still), the environment was romantic and relaxing. We also had small house salads for free and a typical Croatian shot for each person on the house.The price was very reasonable too (35 € for 2 people).But the menus they had were only in German and Croatian , and the waiters were not too good at English, being unable to explain what each course contains . Overall it's a very good restaurant and I'd definitely go again."
3,"+ Tasty German-French Fusion cuisine, + nice view over Hamburg Harbor, + recommended for business dinners, special occasions, and private eventsThe Carls belongs to Hotel Louis C. Jacob and convinces with the same outstanding quality. Although located in the hot spots of Hamburgs' new harbor city Carls is attracting the casual foodie. Its interior uses elements from French brasseries and bistros including a full French loaf as starter. At the Brasserie guests can choose between leather booths facing the restaurant's inside and the Elbe River or tables next to the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river or the new Elbphilharmonic. The menu includes a German-French fusion cuisine and a comprehensive wine list (EUR 20 - 390 with an average bottle price of EUR 40). If listed I recommend to try the cold vichyssoise (actually the best I ever had) in combination with 'Carls Fass' a dry Riesling.Be cautious ordering their water flate rate, which isn't a real flat rate since every carafe is finally balanced on your check! The average costs per person, including drinks are about EUR 65 if you order a la carte or choose a prix fixed menu with wine. People on a budget don't have to refrain from the delicious food since Carls' Bistro offers affordable small plates from EUR 5 - 13 and wines from EUR 4 - 6."
4,"Holy cow!  What a great meal. We were off to a rough start with a small language barrier and seating. (We we're asked to change tables twice). But it really didn't matter in the end because everyone was great. The restaurant is small and got very busy. You should make reservations. The food was excellent and fresh. Kudos to the staff that seemed all family, but I'm not sure. Go here if you are in the area."
3,"Totally worth the 30 minute wait. TOTALLY WORTH IT! Anyone who knows me knows I am on a mission from the Tex-Mex Gods to find the best burrito in Europe. This is the running. First of all the guacamole was heaven. HEAVEN I tell you. It was so good that, despite knowing I should stop so I could finish my burrito, I could not help myself. I had to eat it or my soul would perish. The burrito was just as good, well seasoned, perfected black beans, ungodly amounts of cheese. Oh BURRITO LORDS, WHY MUST I LIVE IN PRAGUE WHEN THIS SUBLIME TASTE OF TEX-MEX IS IN HAMBURG!?!?!? OH THE HUMANITY!!!!Added to this brilliant experience of burrito bliss, were the two lovely men working the smallish restaurant. I think I made the chef's day by singing the praises of this religious moment in my mouth. The only reason they don't get five stars is burritos need margaritas. Other than that, I will darken their door whenever I am in Hamburg."
4,"The best coffee we had in Hamburg. Espresso as good as i Italy. Lots of people to look at, and excellent place to blend in and watch sct. Pauli meet schanzen..."
3,"If you want to try out some authentic mexican food and drink way too much Tequila then this is the place to come. I had an enchilada like never before. Cocoa sauce, which sounds odd but is actually pretty delicious. The staff were pretty attentive dashing back and forth with the lime, salt, tequila and san miguel. A good place to have a works party as it's going to be pretty quiet midweek, and so you can take over the bar. With my recently discovered love of burritos, it made me one step closer to believing that the best cuisine and venues are mexican. Will be going back to see what the burritos are like."
0,"Save your €26.50 and head to a real restaurant.  This one is a joke for service and value for money. Eaten in many places like this all over the world, and  don't expect much.  Buffet is extremely basic for the money, pre cooked food was with cheap ingredients and small choice.  ""Live Cooking"" is ok, although hygiene of the food is far from ok.  Flies buzzing around the mounds of uncooked meat and fish and the cook didn't seem to know what he was doing.  The very small selection Sushi was awful, cheap and dried out.  The tiramisu was a mushy mess left in the bowl, the scraps from others desert helpings.  Asked the head waiter if they had a fresh tiramisu, who did get a fresh one, but proceeded to moan at his customer that normally you need to finish off the scraps before they can change, or their boss gets angry... All in all, save your disappointment and keep on walking..."
1,"A big no go for this place. The service was good, but the food a disaster. Me and my wife ordered chicken teriyaki and kunsperige ente. The chicken dish hardly contained chicken, guess chicken is rare these days. The duck dish was very dry. You could hardly eat the duck."
4,I just found this coffee place and checked it! I had a cappuccino and a piece of their homemade cheesecake. The cheesecake was very good. Homemade and with a coconut flavor. The topping was strawberry jam but im not sure if homemade. Anyway the cheesecake was awesome!! Lovely place and friendly service!
3,"The best burger I have ever had in the Europe thus far. As an American, I'm pretty picky on my burgers - I love them, and I've only been scarred by my experiments in Europe with burgers. When visiting...Hamburg, my friend and I thought it'd be fitting to have...a hamburger, in Hamburg. An acquaintance recommended this place, and they were right - it was great. The atmosphere is like a hip Mexican hipster cantina, despite no Mexican food. There are old punk records over the bar and really friendly bartenders. We didn't have a reservation, so we had to sit at the bar, which was fine. We each had beers and I had a burger (something Texan) with an egg on it (I love eggs on anything) and my friend had a cheeseburger. The burgers themselves are HUGE, and were perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. They fell apart and were very juicy. The weirdest thing is that the burgers come on *English muffins*. I had experienced that before with a good burger in Seattle at brunch recently, but..it was a bit odd. I think the burger would have held together a bit better with a sturdier bun, but, it makes the place unique. I'll surely revisit this place when craving a burger in Hamburg again. Delicious!!"
2,"3 stars because i am not a fan of zoos. and because its not THAT bigBut ive been told this is the biggest privately financed zoo in germany. i went there during the jungle nights in june. entrance costs 17.5EUR (1.5EUR extra to the normal days)On that night, the zoo was open till at least 11.30 with shows all over the zoo. Well as i said before i am not a fan of zoos, so i cant say i had a lot of fun. It's not very big but has a number of different exotic animals. But the thing is I've been to the Leipzig zoo and the leipzig one was much bigger than hamburgs with much more variety. So i was kinda suprised that hamburgs zoo wasnt 'small' And on that evening, hagenbecks was really full, and a lot of kids running back and forth. They seemed to be enjoying their time. Now that i have seen the zoo, supported it financially, i don't think i will be back.Ive seen their lions, pinguins, giraffes, monkeys, tigers, lions ... so i dont need to come back to see them all over again :P Oh and the kangaroo part of the zoo stinks by the way, i couldnt stay inside more than 30 seconds! The best part is that you can feed the animals, had i known i would have taken some fruits and veggies with me... However, worth the visit. I dont regret going there at all!"
2,"Nice Place to Drink One or two coktails and have some soulfood. If you go there Be thirsty , hungry and enjoy :)"
3,"Good place to go with friends if you are in Hamburg. Perhaps a little bit touristy, but it's fun! Went there twice during my stay in the city and had frankfurters and bratwursts, along with a cold Bavarian beer."
4,"Hands down the best falafel in Hamburg. Freshly made, unlike par for the course at most Döner places, who just microwave something that resembles warm wet cardboard. Not only are the falafel fresh, but also perfectly made, crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. All the vegetarian salads and sides like tabbouleh and hummus are also good. If you dine-in- try either the Falafel or Mixed plate (5 Euros), served with a plate full of side dishes. If youre on the run, get the falafel in bread (2.50, ""spezial"" for 3 Euros with your choice of extra like eggplant)."
3,"Oh, Hamburg. People tout you as a place for business which may equal boring, but I don't think so.Strand Pauli is proof of nights that you only dream about in your summer fantasies. Strandpauli is also proof that Germans LOVE their beach bars. It is here where the beach scene is created and lived over and over again: sand at your feet, a bonfire to keep you warm at night, refreshing summery drinks (caipirinha? mojito? you got it) and lots of outdoor seating so you can appreciate the views of the harbor.Cocktail prices hover around €6.50 per long drink or for a short glass of Sapphire & Tonic.Good times, bro."
3,"The inside of this place makes you want to curl up with a good book, have a coffee and relax for a while. We came for breakfast and both really enjoyed our dishes. My husband got the dish that had smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and some salad type dish that looked like potato salad but he couldn't figure out what it was exactly (but really liked it). The smoked salmon had a horseradish type sauce on the side that he really enjoyed. They also served a basket of bread on the side (not sure if it was included with his) with a croissant, a roll and two other types of bread. I got the sweet pancakes with bananas and maple syrup and while it wasn't what I imagined as pancakes (think more of like a Dutch baby + a pancake), it was delicious and filling. My husband's dish definitely stole the show, though. We both said we would come back to try their dinner as several dishes sounded fantastic to both of us."
4,"Easily the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Great views and convenient location centralized in Hamburg. Right in the water! Friendly service, a blend of Italian and French food. This was more of a tourist location than for the locals which easier to navigate and order. Nice place to rest your feet for a while and enjoy an excellent meal. Try the chicken sandwich!"
4,"Leckere Pastagerichte mit Salatbeilage auf Wunsch. Bei Rita schmeckts wirklich prima, ideal fuer den Business Lunch. Im Sommer kann man nett draussen sitzen. Einzig die  guenstige  Preisgestaltung bleibt undurchsichtig: mal kostet Salat extra, mal nicht."
4,"You'll never be disappointed with what ever you choose at Herr Max! They serve lots and lots of great cake.. My fave is Cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. Their cheesecake is the best cheesecake ever! The tanginess from cheese and lime is well balanced with the moist sweet biscuit base. And the chocolate mousse cake is not too sweet, so you can enjoy the richness of the chocolate. 3 layers of pure joy!"
4,"Can't believe I've never reviewed Olivio! A firm lunch favourite of mine (check today's pizza monza which is sat inside of me right now), this is perhaps the friendliest restaurant in Hamburg, nay, the world! A hilarious husband and wife team had us writing down our order on a piece of paper and delivering it to the kitchen today! If you go on a Friday lunchtime you often get free wine refills, not that I drink at lunch of course... Brilliant."
3,Pretty good place for a burrito. not the cheapest place to eat but great food.
4,Please go here to sample some excellent food and beer. A hidden gem in the centre of Hamburg.
4,It doesn't look like much from the outside but it is a friendly comfortable place for a drink and cake. Every time I've been there it has been full and the pastries are great!
4,"What a gem this place is.  I walked a solid 2 miles from the S-Bahn to get here, as it's nestled in a Hamburg neighborhood.  It's not a tourist spot.  It was worth the walk.Landhaus Scherrer is an interesting combination of first class and family in its decor and service. The single waiter than handled my room was a gentleman - thoughtful, professional, and capable of a laugh at the sight of a child (a family was dining that night).  The greeting woman seemed quite similar - a bit serious at first, but clearly very kind if you needed help.So the atmosphere was excellent, but the food actually topped it.  This is no neighborhood comfort food.  After picking out an incredibly inexpensive (but good) wine for me, the waiter brought out a complementary plate of variations on a pumpkin theme - ice cream, custard, pumpkin slices, etc, all prepared differently and all wonderful.  After a salad came the crusted duck dish. It was one of the best duck dishes I've ever had - full of flavor and wonderfully prepared.  I also had an excellent desert, but I can't recall it any longer.In sum, Landhaus Scherrer is a real find for a visitor of Hamburg.  I hope it's well-known by the locals.  Regardless, all who visit or live in Hamburg should stop in."
4,Good and cheap place to eat kumpir. Great variaty of kumpir. Big sizes and good prices.
3,Delicious food!!! Not so much vegetarian options but I loved my salad. Also good price. Friendly staff.
4,"Lovely café with some places downstairs and more upstairs. One room upstairs is furnished like a livingroom of your grandma could be, with some cozy armchairs, sofas, coffee tables and wallpapered walls!I can't tell if the breakfast there is good, because I couldn't snatch a free table. But I assume it really is, because the seats to brunch on a sunday are fully booked two weeks in advance! SO MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION EARLY ENOUGH! Tip: if this place is crowded, go to the café called Caffeé Latte. It's just a few metres down the street and not as big as that place. They have some nice breakfasts as well!"
3,"Large portions, mostly friendly staff although nearly getting into a shouting match with one of them simply because we waited about 10 seconds before telling him that we were switches tables with another group is definitely something that should never happen.It also didn't help that a friend wait first to the counter to order his things before I went simply we both didn't want to leave our valuables at the table unguarded. Ordering seems to be complicated here ;-)That being said, the good was great! I had a huge Enchilada with Mole Poblano on top of it. Not a big fan of the chocolate flavor here but that was totally my own fault for not reading the menu ;-)We also had a Burrito which looked and smelled excellent!I would definitely go there again but only when its not too crowded. If the two incidents with the staff hadn't happened, I would have given Jim Burrito 5 stars."
3,"When planning your trip to Hamburg, don't count on going to any museums on Monday, as they are all closed.  Except for this little culinary nugget :)We actually ended up here by default, after realizing everything else would be closed for the day.  We also found out that we would have to join in on the German tour, as they only do English speaking tours on the weekends.  Fortunately, this all changed when the tour guide was having someone shadow her because it was her first day.  This meant the seasoned tour guide could stay back and explain everything in English.Overall, this museum is really cool.  They walk you through the ways in which chocolate is made, from selecting the cocoa bean, to roasting, to processing, to the final product.  And they let you try the cocoa all along the way! It is also equipped with an opportunity to make your own chocolate bar, which is very cool.  This tour can  take up to 2 hours, so make sure you plan accordingly.  You definitely don't want to cut it short.Fun museum and would definitely recommend to those looking for something a bit different in Hamburg."
4,"Exploring lunch options in the neighborhood, I came here because it was the highest rated place on Yelp. And rightfully so. Turns out it's actually more of a breakfast place, but that's okay. The service is very friendly. (I didn't feel like I was bothering the staff with my money, as is often the case in Hamburg.) The lady behind the counter was really cool. Although breakfast was over and some items were sold out, she told me what they had available and helped me pick something. The spinach quiche sounded good. And it was! Himalaya salt and black pepper at hand, it left me wanting another. Alas! The price was a bit steep at 4.50€. However it came with a simple side salad with fresh, beautiful looking vegetables and balsamic vinaigrette. I appreciate the effort; too many places are serving premix salads nowadays.I don't usually order filter coffee (prefer cafe crema/ americano) but my pocket change was limited today and it was the cheapest option. It came served with *warmed-up* milk on the side (nice detail) and a little biscotti. It also tasted good! Ok, Filter Coffee. You get a second chance.The locals are diverse. Great people watching from the window seats. The atmosphere is nice, cozy, and not overly cute as is the trend lately. The music is also pretty great. They picked some local station that plays many classics among other current pop hits from around Europe.I can't find anything against this place. The prices are acceptable considering that quality items and friendly service seem to be primary concerns here. 5 stars earned. I'll definitely come back."
4,Best weekend breakfast in town! Lovely terrace when the weather permits. Great coffee in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
4,Very good food and incredibly nice staff. The restaurant has a cosy atmosphere. Mango lassi was also tasty.
3,It's all decorated with Mexican wrestling accouterments and the burritos may not be California (or Texas?) worthy but they're better than anything you'll find in New York City.
4,Look on yelp to find restaurant near hotel crown plaza this was beyond my expectations service food presentation all 5 stars  the  hostess was so nice spoke English perfect (which I had hard x finding people who spoke English in Hamburg) husband and wife team !!!she hostess he chef great team We ate they 2 of the 3 days we were in Hamburg this is the kind of place that I hope to find in big city so if u r in Hamburg try it I know u will not be disappointed I had fish sea bass so so goodAlso dorado best in long x serve  with vegetable & salad Husband have schnitzel both night one pork one veal fried potatoes  and salad happy manAnd the price for a perfect meal was very reasonable
4,"Great restaurant! A nice place, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The meal were excellents, the meet soft and tasty, the side dish good but perhaps a little bit too simple, and the price was fully justified (we were even expecting to pay more). I only can recommend this place for people who are looking for a little more sophisticated dinner."
0,"Do not bother, we waited upwards of 30 minutes between servers and the meat was just not that great.  Big disappointment both in food quality and service, especially at the price..."
4,"Amazing! this place has 5 stars on Yelp and deserves it. This place really goes back to the basics, you eat in a tent and the menu is on a chalk board. Very traditional German is served here. I had a Wiener Schnitzel with fried potatoes. When he brough my plate out I could not believe how huge the schnitzel was and how many potatoes I got.The guy did not really speak English but was very helpful non the less he made sure I like it and even asked a passerby to help when I ordered to make sure he got my order right!At the end he told me desert was included! I got rice pudding that was simple but good. I don't even know how I had room left to eat it.All of that and a drink and my whole meal was less than 10 euros!Go for sure if you are in Hamburg!!"
2,"I've eaten at vegetarian restaurants a lot and have plenty of experience with them. I was actually on my way to somewhere else that had a good yelp review, when I saw Loving Hut and decided to stop here instead.Figuring out a vegan Vietnamese menu that is written in German when you only speak English is a bit of a challenge. Lots of words like ""tofu"", ""reis"" and ""soja"" were obvious enough. I felt pretty comfortable ordering with my limited understanding of the menu. I got number 29, which was spicy vegetables and tofu (aren't they all? I don't know). It was good. The proprietor spoke enough English to make it work.Prices are reasonable, but its cash only. They do not serve any alcohol at all. Service is pretty slow because there aren't too many people working the (just 2?). Still, I didn't find the wait bad. Just a little noticeable. If I had a bottle of white wine, I might not have noticed the wait at all. Hint hint.The joy of finding a place that serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan foods is diminished somewhat because the food is just so-so. It's not brilliant, but its not at all bad. I thought my order was a little light on tofu. Just 5 or 6 pieces. I asked fir it spicy, though, and i got what i asked for. The appetiser we ordered was something akin to vegetarian breaded fried prawns. They weren't much to speak of."
2,Sushi was alright. Staff wasn't directly rude but it felt uncomfortable. On top of that it is very busy and very very loud. Not suited for a relaxed dinner with friends.
4,best 24 hour tuerkisch place in hamburg! love the service! have been schlepping everyone here since decades. good comfort food right when feeling a cold or flue wanting to creep out of the system!
3,"Central Park is open!cozy nice placeA beach club in the middle of schanze! It's close to home, so i guess i'd be spending a lot of saturday and sunday afternoons there!"
2,"Non-food: 5/5Food: 3/5The decor and overall vibe of this restaurant is exquisite, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the menu has extensive vegetarian and meat options. After the meal, one is served mango schnapps and paan mukhwas.I ordered naan bread and spicy chicken tikka masala, which came with rice. My meal arrived very quickly, and the presentation of the food was very on-point (see attached photos), just like the ambiance. My waiter also brought a green chili sauce, which wasn't that spicy but tasted very good.I thought the tikka masala here wasn't bad but wasn't great and wouldn't order it again. I'd also recommend picking a different dish if you're between options. The naan was very tasty, and the rice was decent.I can recommend this restaurant for a group dinner due to the great ambiance and service quality. Despite not being super impressed with the taste of my entree, I left feeling very satisfied and want to come back to try a different dish."
3,"Great food, drink and cocktails too. great location. a definite improvement on the rather snooty Ratsweinkeller that used to be there."
2,"After eating here twice and the restaurant next door (Falafelstern) twice, I'm not impressed by the taste of the food at Kimo, so I'd definitely recommend going next door for falafel instead. I've ordered the large falalplatter here twice, which for 5.50 euro comes with a large variety and decent quantity of food. The falafel is decent tasting, and five balls are included. There's also a basket provided with a few pieces of flat pita.Kimo does have more choices and a less fast-food feeling, but I'd still go to Falafelstern hands-down because I find the falafel and other ingredients much tastier."
2,"The atmosphere here is certainly very pleasant. Staff is friendly, the restaurant is very nicely decorated, noise level is unobtrusive, etc.The food is, well, overpriced, just like others have already stated - think roughly 15 Euros for a vegetarian meal and about 18 for a meat dish.The focus here is on appearance and on sauce. Thus, you will receive a dish that looks visually stunning - but there won't be much to it. In essence, you will receive whatever your chosen main ingredient is, doused in a sauce.It's fine, but it's completely overpriced for what you get. You can apply this rule to just about any dish we ordered. Tofu and Chili? It's really just fried tofu and and a few slices of chili pepper in a spicy sauce. Would it have hurt them to add a few veggies? Of course, you might say that the food is exactly what the description says - and that is certainly true. However, I do NOT find this to be true at any of the rather many Thai restaurants I've eaten at around the globe. Maybe it's a German thing?The red curry followed the same principle - there was, however, a tiny bit of variation in it. We counted four peas. Three halves of mushrooms. Some carrot slices. And lots of cabbage. That seemed a bit lame. Alas, you know what took the cake: Mini Corn out of jar!!! I have no idea who in their right mind still uses mini corn in any dish, let alone a Thai dish - all I know is that's it's a big N O.Overall, our experience was nice - but this restaurant is not really up to snuff. I think Germany is still desperately trying to incorporate it's ""multi-kulti"" aspirations in the culinary scene - and things are improving. For now, the German palate still has not reached a comprehensive understanding of the wide array of food that is available. Sure, each cuisine is tailored to local tastes anywhere in the world - and that ""customization"" can be offensive if you expect ""authentic."" It's akin to eating Chinese food in Latin America. Or  ""Mexican"" in Germany (I've tried - I don't think that really exists).So, if you want Thai, then this is certainly acceptable. Don't expect to get any real Thai food - expect a bare minimum that caters to the German palate. It's close enough for now.I don't think I would go back. There are, quite apparently, better venues to be tried."
4,"Every time I am in Hamburg I go directly to see main man Peter at Mini-Grill,he makes the World's Best Chicken, no doubt about it. Also the 'gurken salat' (cucumber salad) is excellent and the pommes frites (french fries) are excellent with homemade curry ketchup. Also enjoy very much the original art work from the late great artist Erwin Ross, some of his last work before he was tragically struck down by an automobile. (Erwin painted Beatles logo.svg. Wordmark of The Beatles, originally painted directly on drum by Erwin Ross, Hamburg. Date. 1960) ask Peter when you are in there enjoying the world's best chicken. People actually fight over the chickens sometimes because they can not cook them fast enough, so get there when it's not busy or be patient and wait...it's worth it! Jon Hammond"
4,"While visiting my friend's father for the weekend, we walked around the block to this restaurant for lunch. It was great, fresh ingredients, well prepared food, and friendly service. So good we went back for dinner the next night, equally fantastic. It's clearly popular with the locals (who ought to know!) as the place was completely full on a Tuesday night. Highly recommended. Price was reasonable too!"
3,"I can highly recommend this restaurant - we have eaten heir twice and were impressed each time. Interesting  menu, fresh ingredients and our food was delicious."
4,"Amazing food in a warm, somewhat stuffy basement filled with Chinese people even on Tuesday night (always a good sign).Very good Dim Sum, Kai Lan with garlic, even the small spring rolls were perfect  super crispy and fresh. This is REAL Chinese.I have had a lot of Chinese food over the years but this was certainly one of the best and I will certainly go here again on my next visit to Hamburg :)"
3,"Pretty awesome salads! Best I've had so far in hamburg. I had the 'Zeigenkäse' salad which is a goat's cheese and honey salad with some grains, cranberries and a mix of lettuce. I picked the sweet chili orange sauce. All in all a very good and very filling salad. All the ingredients complemented each other well. The large size is really large. I was pleased.About the place: It's a salad bar with the option of picking your base, couple of ingredients (grains, cranberries etc) and your protein (chicken, halloumi or goats cheese) and a dressing. Alternatively you can instead pick one of their preexisting salads. Basically your standard salad bar; these are unfortunately uncommon here"
4,"A newcomer on Hamburg Irish bar scene: there have been a few already and this one looks promissing too!Wonderful interior, lots of green of course (you can't skeep that) friendly service, beer and other drinks. And yes, they speak English!The highlight for me is karaoke, which they want to do regularly. Also wiskey tasting is another event they host.Let's see what comes next. Irish dance evenings perhaps?"
4,"This had to be one of the highlights of our trip. Take your time to look for all of the minute details! You'll not believe what you will see...a whole miniature world of people working, playing, beautiful scenic sights, city light...so much to see, the three hours we spent there allowed to really enjoy the work that's gone into the entire display!"
3,"Yummy food, good service and a cozy atmosphere-- Das Dorf serves up a very nice German dining experience. Before our trip to Hamburg, we made a reservation at Das Dorf for a Saturday evening. We arrived for our reservation and was seated right away. The place doesn't look very big at first, but they definitely take advantage of every single corner available. The atmosphere is cosy albeit you're cramped into a cellar.I had the stewed ox cheeks and my husband had the schnitzel. The ox cheeks were very flavorful and the schnitzel was good. The portions were generous and the service was nice and fast. I would recommend Das Dorf for a nice dinner in Hamburg."
3,"This is our neighborhood restaurant. It is quite simple, but it has a lot of charm. It is a family owned restaurant, run by very nice and friendly people. You are kinda transported to another place, where the children can play on the sidewalk, and everybody knows each other (and we kinda do, because we are also kinda neighbors). So if you live close to here, or are close to the restaurant, come over and sit outside."
3,I had Mezze for lunch and I was more than pleased with my choice. The taste and presentation were tops and the portions were pretty decent. Very cozy restaurant and very friendly staff. Tip: it could potentially have mote tables
3,"Really good burger in Europe. Like the establishment and the touchscreen menu at the table. Quick efficient service, excellent tasting burger. You order it medium and u get it medium."
4,"At first you may be overwhelmed by the fullness of the restaurant but it is extremely simple to order, just choose a dish and it will normally already come with extras like rice and naan. DELICIOUS!!"
4,"Really great Vietnamese street food obviously made fresh, very flavorful! A nice menu with some unique options to choose from including the popular Pho soup, grilled pork on noodles, or their specialty drinks (like the Gingerly with lime/mint/brown sugar, tangy yet sweet). Reasonable prices, but if you come at the prime times for lunch or dinner you will have to wait for seating since it is a small place (worth it though!)."
4,"Delicious German food our beautifully rustic atmosphere. We had the Rinderroulade and Pannfisch, which both were delicious.The staff is super friendly and helpful. Added with a bit of luck you also get to meet the house's dog."
3,Recommended for high ambiance and good food.
3,"I've been here twice and had different experiences each time.The first time was amazing. Everything tasted fresh and the spices were all combined perfectly to make a really delicious and aromatic meal.The second time wasn't quite as good. The curry was great, but the rice just didn't seem properly cooked. In fact, the whole meal just didn't seem fresh enough.Although the service does seem a bit comatose, I will say that the staff didn't fall short when it came to problem resolution. They replaced a drink that we were dissatisfied with free of charge  no attitude whatsoever, despite the fact that it was obviously our fault for ordering the wrong drink to begin with.The prices are a bit high and it seems the quality can be inconsistent, but overall  a decent place to grab some good Asian food."
2,"Brilliant food, unbelievably slow service. Breakfast we got here was lovely but it took 75 mins to serve scrambled eggs & bacon."
3,Recently vastly improved Italian restaurant. Al fresco dining at a reasonable price.
4,"Not only the best Chinese food in Hamburg, but the best ethnic restaurant thus far in the city!  Being Chinese and from California, I'm very picky in regards to ethnic cuisine - especially anything Asian.  I've now tried a handful of Asian places in Hamburg and have been sorely disappointed each and every time.  Either it's been Germanic interpretations of Asian food, or Asian simply not done right.  With that kept in mind, Mei Moon was an incredibly nice surprise!  The restaurant has a very extensive menu, but mixed in are quite authentic dishes.  The dim sum items were great - very fresh, made to order, served piping hot, and seasoned just right.  Service was very good - the wait staff spoke perfect German, English, and Chinese.  The atmosphere was like any Chinese restaurant stereotyped, but very clean nonetheless.  This will be my go-to place from now on whenever that craving for good Chinese hits."
4,"The food and service were really good! We had a little problem with the extra BBQ sauce on spare ribs, they apologised and brought a new one (even we finished most of the plate)! Really nice attitude!"
4,"Great atmosphere, raw and minimalist deco, cheap original and fresh delicious cocktails (yep, all of it), awesome music, chill people...what would you want more for a Friday night?"
0,Got it to go. As far as getting it on time great job. However very disappointing sushi. They were falling apart. The fried sushi was stuffed with what tasted and looked like canned tuna. The fish tasted old and we felt very unwell afterwards. We were supposed to get squid sushi but it was not in the package. Everything was either horrible or tasteless.
2,Charming restaurant on the Shanze. I had the Trucker schnitzel (featuring two fried eggs) and just about managed to finish it - very tasty. The decor of the old Apothecary adds a nice atmosphere and its particular warm and cosy in cold weather with the hot water pipes lining the edge of the room.
4,Super YUM! Walked by and got a seat inside right away. Had Spargel and salmon - it was HEAVEN.Could pay with our Visa card as well and that was helpful as not all restaurants take that.Came back again with a group of relatives and it was amazing again.Definitely can recommend!
4,I went there last month for the first time to take my after-lunch-coffee. nice little cafe near to the campus with delightful turkish food. My all time favourite for lunch is the self made PIDE  tastes great. yummy!
3,"I don't come to Germany for the coffee.  But I stopped by nord coast after hearing about it from a friend and was pleasantly surprised.They make both light roast and dark roast espresso.  I was surprised by this, and inquired with the owner as to why, and he responded that most Germans do not drink anything other than dark roast.  Him and I wink at each other and acknowledge that light roast is where all the flavor and complexity is really at.  I know German culture takes time to adapt.  GERMAN PEOPLE IF YOU'RE READING THIS -- try the light roast it will not harm you.The food is great.  My favorite breakfast I've had so far is the poached egg with pesto, pomegranate, and spinach.  The waffles are pretty good too, with fruit and whipped cream.If you've tried the espresso, then it's worth trying the coffee.  They've got some preparation techniques that are uniquely German (I forget the name but ask one of the folks working there).  I tried one and it was really good.Other highlights: the place is on the canal and has a nice view.  In addition, they are pretty chill so you might wait for your coffee sometimes.  I pestered the staff with a ton of questions and they were nice enough to answer all of them!"
4,"I don't if it is because I was starving or something, the lunch sandwich I got there was stunning! I had Schweinebratens sandwich with salad. The meat was tender and juicy and the sauce is tasty. Everything tastes perfect! God I am hungry now. Definitely would like to come again and recommend to friends."
4,"I love, love, love Loving Hut! I come here for dinner at least once a month. Although the service can be a bit slow (this place gets packed and it's family run, so sometimes there's only one guy in front), the food can't be beat and it's well worth the wait. I've tried a lot of things on the menu and enjoyed them all, but I always come back to the summer rolls and the pho. Speaking of the soup, never will you have a better meatless pho, and even before I became a vegetarian I would've said this is the best in Hamburg regardless of animals protein content. So, whether you eat meat or not, this place is highly recommended!"
4,"The most Irish Irish pub that I've been to in Hamburg. They pride themselves on the quality of their Guinness, the breadth of their whiskey collection and the standard of their food. I told them I found them on the internet as the top Irish pub in Hamburg, they countered with we're the top Irish pub in Germany! and pointed to a wall of awards. When we approached the bar we were offered two Guinness, almost as if that was the only option. I asked about the other beer available and then decided that it was either Kilkenny or Guinness. I went for Guinness. Next up, choosing some food. Near the front of the menu was Fish and Chips. I love a good fish and chips, but I've not had any since coming to live in Germany (1 year ago). I asked how it was, more meaning what type of fish and chips it was (chippy or restaurant), and was told that it's very good. I was then told that they were so confident in it that If you don't like it, you can have it for free. The Guinness was good. The fish was beautiful. As with all Irish pubs, the prices aren't cheap. A 400ml Guinness is EUR3.70 and the Fish and Chips was EUR10. I'll be back."
4,"Don't really understand the bad reviews, cause I  really liked this bar! They play really good music and have an underground disco section. If you don't want wait behind the crowd to get your drinks by the main bar, you can go underground to get your drinks there as it was way less busy.Prices are decent and staff is friendly.  If I visited Hamburg again I'd probably return!"
3,"Good after works, happy hours & some random students. Quite a nice location in city center, venue itself is trying to be cool and modern. Food is not my highest choice, but drinks are definitely 8out of 10! So for Thursday evening after work drink - big yes!"
4,"Brilliant chinese restaurant and easily the best I've been to in Hamburg. Golden seem to concentrate more on traditional Chinese dishes instead of the carbon-copy stuff we're all used to seeing on the menu in other Chinese establishments. So, what's on the menu? Well, what isn't? Asparagus in chopped scampi, cold glass-noodle salad, green onion soup, various rice, noodle, beef, fish and chicken dishes, Golden really has it all, and most of it will be very new to you - so try it out! Very highly recommended!"
3,"One of the few good quality places on the Schanze. Not too big with a DJ inside, still it is not a club, but a bar. Cocktails are quite OK as well. It gets pretty crouded so make sure you go a bit earlier or around 10pm. They have a huge screen-bar where when you move your hand the animated fish reacts and starts moving towards your hand. It is quite cool."
4,This town hall is really impressive with its architecture and interior inside.  Felt a bit like entering a church rather than a town hall.  Highly recommend to anyone to look at.
4,Had a lovely dinner here in Hamburg at [m]eatery.Now I don't eat beef so can't review them on all their dry aged beef. Normally don't eat any meat but occasionally will eat seafood and fish. I started with the seafood chunky chowder and it was thick and creamy with tons of flavor. Great way to start. For my main I ordered 3 types of fish tartare. They could not have been any better. The highlight was the salmon tartare Asian style. Wow was it freaking delicious! Now my side dish may have stole the show. Mashed potatoes with sautéed shallots and black truffles! So amazing! So if ever in Hamburg Germany hit this place up!
4,"Thamers must be one of the oldest pubs in Hamburg, the bar looks positively ancient. The beer selection is interesting (they are the only bar that I've found to sell Duckstein Weizen) and the food looks great - I've only ever had the goulash soup and it was the best I've had in Hamburg. If there is one small problem, then it's that the bar is quite, er, small. Each time I've been I've managed to get the last table, but I've never been at what I would consider a peak time"
4,"The chicken donër is amazing. I recommend getting both the chili sauce and the yogurt, the combination packs a little heat with a refreshing cool. The meat, bread, flavors... everything was delicious and only €4. I would have gladly paid double for something so good. The lunch line can get long but it moves relatively fast. I was in and out in a matter of 5 minutes.It was exactly what I have been craving for the last.... couple of years from a time when I ate way too many street kebabs in Montmartre. I will definitely be back again."
0,"They put the chairs upside down in our table while there were 15 min to closing. A good product will not sell if you don't know how to behave , sorry Jim Borrito"
1,The place is nice but the food is definitely not authentic as is the decoration of orange slices on the plate. No spices used and we asked for Indian spicy. For someone who lived in the uk it is disappointing! The staff is friendly but it's very overpriced for what you get!
4,Very nice pub - good food - cosy atmosphere and lovely service!
4,"Beautiful restaurant with excellent food.  I had a wonderful Tuna steak, home made fries and Noilly Prat sauce. So yummie!!!"
2,Was quite disappointed with the service. The food was OK but I've had better.
4,"I walked the streets for over an hour finding this place and working up my appetite. Upon entering, I saw a bustling, too busy for words or greetings staff doing what needed to be done to satisfy the already packed house.But then... appeared in the doorway between the bar and the first small dining room, a middle aged man with herring bone rimmed glasses and a chef's stature, looking like he belonged. Our eyes met and I moved slowly closer to him to question if they were still serving. (fear set in that it was after nine on a Saturday night with a packed house they would tell me they are out of food). The gentleman introduced himself as Sven, the owner and chef and pointed to a small table they obviously squeezed in for single diners like myself.A woman server quickly set the table, seated me and handed me tonight's menu. Hand written (by Sven himself) in German, I struggled to grasp just one dish to be recognizable. NOT! When the server returned, I asked her what alphabet this menu was written in? She said the chef writes the menu every night in his own handwriting, and she proceeded to read and translate in English the offerings of the night. All sounded incredibly creative and amazing, so my reply was, ""what is everyone raving about tonight?"" She suggested the Pepper Steak on a bed of Navy, Lima and Green beans. And the Swordfish Carpaccio. I asked her to wine pair the best of what was 'by the glass' and that she did. An Italian Rosé with the Carpaccio and a Portuguese Cabernet Sauvignon with the Steak.A whole lot more action and another glass of wine occurred and wow, oh wow what an amazing culinary and night on the town with Sven unfolded. I could go on and on here... it was my last night in Hamburg which is why I opted to dine in the best I could find. Well it turned out to be Sven's last night as he was 'moving on' (not retiring) but just done with this chapter of his life. Upon finishing my main course, Sven politely joined me at my table and told me his story of how he started the restaurant 33 year's ago. He pulled a delightful older man close to him and began kissing his bald head and telling me how much he loved this man. The man had been with the restaurant for 28 years as the kitchen coordinator/dishwasher/busboy and all 'round go-to man behind the scenes. It was obviously an emotional moment for both these guys.Sven gestured to the bartender to pour me another glass of wine (on the house) and continued his story about how the German government offers a €100,000 tax deduction if you've started a business and sell it at age 55. Sven proceeded to invite me out on the town with him for a few more drinks in the St. George district where he knew all the local pubs and lots and lots of people. He even walked me to the train station to make sure I got on the right train back to my hotel.Anyway... so much more to this story...Bottom line... I'm sure the quality of food coming out of this kitchen will sustain because the staff obviously loved Sven and were sad to see him go. The understudies in the kitchen are apparently who bought the restaurant and planned on changing nothing.I hope I run into Sven again someday... maybe in Portugal or the Azores!"
1,"The beer is good. The service was poor / spotty. I think they prefer their local crowd who will be there. Not child friendly at night, though they have a kids menu."
4,"We went there on our last evening of our Germany trip. We had high expectations, and were afraid that they might not be fulfilled, but they were! The good was amazing! We had pulpo and bruschetta as an entree and Himachi and entrecôte as a Main course. Everything was delicious! The Location is really nice and surprisingly not that loud as I expected. Our waiter was really kind and nice. She checked regularly if the wine and beer were empty or not. Btw, the White ""House wine"" was really good! We will come back next year when we will be the next time in Hamburg"
3,"This is a very hip bar not far from Hamburg uni. The lighting is spot on, the venue is cleverly designed and has comfy seating arrangements and a great bar to sit at. The Barstaff are knowlageble and friendly and they have a 5 euro cocktail menu...the Cosmopolitains being so scrummy I wish I had of had time to order another one.There's table football and a DJ box with a Live DJ playing music that sets the tone but isn't too overpowering on your conversation. Located right near the cinema this is a great place to pop in pre film or afterwards. Bonus points for the decor, it's adorable....feel like going back though wiht a gold metalic marker next time and drawing a horn on all the little gold ponies painted on the wall as then it would be a unicorn bar wouldn't it?"
2,"Spent a very pleasant evening here recently. We were holding a small celebratory dinner with 5 business colleagues. The ambience was relaxed, friendly but just formal enough to make it appropriate for this event. Cox has a French feel to it with a menu and wines to match and what looks like a decent small bar alongside, though we didn't get chance to use it (the restaurant was very accommodating given that we put back our arrival by 1.5 hours!)."
4,Excellent omelette with ham and cheese. Very helpful translating to English. Cozy atmosphere.
4,"Great variety. Large portions, friendly helpful and knowledgeable staff.Decor is straight forward and simple. Comfy booths are a must. I had a spiced checked burrito with extra jalapeños and loved every bite.Including my Fritz cola and guacamole cost me only €11, so great value too.I'll be back.Maybe even later!"
3,"Very nice bar in the heart of Altona/Ottensen district - don't even try an attempt to come by car - either walk or if 5-10 minutes walk is too far, take a taxi/cab. They have 2 areas to sit outside - left and right of the entrance. No tables though, just some benches (beer garden style). Drinks are not better or worse than in other bars, but I like the atmosphere and you will directly spot why this place is called ""Reh"" (""Deere"") when coming inside."
4,"Excellent location, cheap and delicious fast food. Atmosphere is great, and the guys who work there are really personable. I've become a regular. :)"
2,"Clearly a place to be in Hamburg.  After queuing for 20 min with the others, I could finally see the menu. Overall typical vietnamese choice. Nothing too extravagant.It took them a while to come and take my order.The food was OK, but nothing more. The pho missed fresher herbs and was quite salty. The spring rolls were fresh and crispy as they should be but the dip was rather tasteless. The pork on the bun cha lacked juiciness but had a good taste. Overall the bun was quite cold.All in all not bad, but maybe not worth the wait..."
3,"Huge dishes - we went for traditional lamb & duck, the steak tartare looked a bit overwhelming (neighbouring table ordered it).  Very cool basement setting with high arched ceilings between old columns"
3,"I've been there only once on a sunday.the place was packed, but we did manage to find a table.The waiters are friendly, but not too friendly. which is great in such places.The food is really good, and not expensive.However on sunday its VERY loud, a lot of families, children, babies, running around and shouting at the top of their lungs!"
2,"It's a reasonable place to grab a quick lunch. They have a bunch of pre-made salads and snacks available for grab and go, but the main counter has warm food. The general idea is choose a meat/protein and then mix with a carb. I usually get chicken tandoori with white rice, but they have salmon also. Also pasta and pizza are available. There is a small pastry/bread selection too at the counter."
3,"This is the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Hamburg last week. What a great way to kick off a stint in a new city - with a go-to Ramen spot!My husband and I arrived around 6:40pm on a Wednesday night. It was very busy and we ended up waiting for over an hour for a table for the two of us. After a few minutes of figuring out how the line worked, we added our name to the list.We tried to order gyoza, but they were out. We ordered the fried chicken instead and OMG. It was so juicy and delicious. My only complaint is that we couldn't eat it all, otherwise we wouldn't be hungry for our ramen. For the main course, I ordered the Shio with Egg and Seaweed and my husband ordered the Miso ramen with corn and butter. We were both pleased with the ramen.I can't wait to go again to try out the other types of ramen that they have available!"
1,"Tables were open and not reserved. Very arrogant staff asked us to wait outside in the cold. Some more tables cleared up, we went back in, got asked to wait outside again. Food looked great, but the staff was horrible."
4,"Authentic Vietnamese food and great service. Would always recommend it and it is worth the drive because it is a bit outside of the city centre but as I said: definitely worth it! Family-runned so you can tell they put their heart in it. Loved the ""Banh Canh"" and the fresh mango shake."
3,"The perfect place in Hamburg to sit and have a coffee/wine/beer and soak in the scene. Please forgive my American-ness but this joint is quintessential European. I felt like I was in a movie every time I walked by/sat for a drink. Fantastic people watching, clean bathrooms, speedy & courteous service. Babies, old people, young people, hipster parents, men that wear red pants, you can find them all here."
4,"This is it. One if the most authentic asian restaurants in all of Hamburg. Amazing food for a fair price, hidden away in Hamburg Jenfeld - really of the grid. But don't let that stop you from treating yourself to the most authentic and delicious vietnamese food you'll ever get this far away from Hanoi. And boy are you in for a treat. The food is amazing! Flavourful with a home cooked vibe to the dishes, served with fresh and fragrant herbs, spicy chilies and refreshing drinks. Satisfaction guaranteed! The service is efficient, friendly and accommodating. I once turned up with a friend of mine minutes after closing and they still served us and where so nice to us, even though we stalled their much deserved closing time. Thank you once again! The decor used to be typical to Asian Street Food restaurants (very basic) but they changed all that and redid the restaurant. Purists, regulars and people in the know may shrug off the redesign but I think its great. Hopefully people whom are not accustomed to asian Street Food won't be dissuaded by the backroom flair any longer. The little trip to Jenfeld is time well spent. As a tip, get there on a saturday or sunday morning. The place is bursting with people from all walks of life. Asian families dressed to the nines, groups of young people looking a little hung over from last night, old wrinkly asians all busy chatting away and most likely me, taking the whole scenery in, slurping my jumbo Pho and just being content. I'll see you there!"
4,Unbelievably good food! I had the quiche and my daughter had the farfalle. Absolutely delicious! We also split the carrot cake. It was moist and light. Must eat there again!
3,"L'osteria is a nice and stylish restaurant opposite of the opera. The pizzas are pretty big and very tasty. The pasta dish was ok. The staff was nice but forgot some drinks and we had to wait pretty long for the drinks. A nice feature was an Italian audio played in the restroom, which taught how to make a restaurant reservation in Italian.The entrance was even with the ground."
4,"Stopped by for a quick takeout order today. Super friendly, polite, and clean place. I ordered the dürum and as always it was tasty. Definitely recommend this spot for lunch."
3,"Really cannot believe it took me so long to try this restaurant! Grabbed take out on a Sunday - and it was de-lish. Next time I will call ahead, but there is no menu online that I am aware of. We had Duck with Peking sauce, Wonton Soup, Chicken Chow Mein and veggie rolls. All good. Looking forward to our next Chinese Sunday pick-up!"
4,"I wish Panter was closer to where I live. It's one of the coolest cafes in Hamburg, but I never go here because it's a bit out of the way for me. The menu is a little bit limited, but what they offer they do well. For breakfast there is a selection of omelets and later the menu reverts to being just soup, salad, pasta or paninis. They also have a yummy-looking range of cakes."
2,Beautiful view of Harbour in Hamburg however the service is incredible poor and unfortunately the cocktails are mediocre at their respective price point.Nice if you want a great view not if you're just interested in drinking
3,"This was a pleasant surprise. Even after having read the other reviews, I was not prepared for the sheet size an ingenuity of the whole thing.  Floor after floor of painstakingly detailed models, with some really funny details here an there. Especially the airport is worthwhile to spend some time admiring the lifelike planes and vehicles, including the specific sounds that each plane makes. Quite incredible!"
4,"It is a hidden gem. One of the best restaurant in Hamburg. Very high quality food with a creative touch, yet affordable. Prepair to wait for at least 30 min. to get a table."
4,"Miniatur Wunderland deserves its reputation. They make you travelling through different countries like the US, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria.. The details are fascinating and you won't have the time to get bored. How they conceive the cities is truly impressive and you will be immersed in this miniature world."
4,New look! Great party location. Music for every taste. Friendly staff and an interesting mix of people. Challenge the bartender and order a cockail!Toilettes: Clean & surprisingly cool. (at least b4 12 o'clock)
3,"The Hamburg Dungeon is an interactive journey through the dark history of Hamburg, with actors explaining about e.g. Black Death, the great fire or pirate Störtebeker. Within groups you enter room by room, where the actors wait for you. Everything is a little spooky and therefore there is a minimum age of 10 years old to enter the Dungeon. Enjoy!"
2,"We went to The Bird with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. We ordered drinks, burgers and fries. Then, the waitress told us that they were out of fries. It was 8pm and she waited to tell us after our drinks were served, so we couldn't leave. We waited around one hour to get our dishes, and our drinks were almost empty when the burgers arrived. Our meat was a little bit overcooked but the burgers were still tasty. I think that they are the only restaurant making burger with the ""rare cooking"" authorization, which confirms the quality of the meat."
3,"Had a lovely dinner at this cozy lakeside restaurant. Really reasonable for pretty sizable portions of delicious dishes. Three of us shared three entrees. We tried the daily special which was a whole white fish of some sort with crispy skin. Then three fish fillets that included what seemed to be salmon, halibut and another meatier white fish lightly fried and served on Dijon mustard sauce. We also tried the famous labskaus dish which looked like raw minced meat. I was alarmed until I realized it was warm and was the color of beets. Everything was served in generous portions with sides of pickles and vegetables and so on. The only thing we didn't care for was the risotto. Very nice service by a lovely host who spoke English. Recommend making a reservation. Good for a date followed by a lakeside stroll. ;)"
4,"Over the years I have managed to go to the bird every time i am in hamburg. i have been to hamburg many times. and the bird is a highlight. The fries are fresh potatoes and the burgers re ridiculously good. they are fat, mine are bloody red, juicy, and messy. served on an english muffin which is a nice touch. full bar, awesome staff, and punk rock at heart. i have had the steak once- ribeye- and it was great, but the burgers really are the main attraction. lots of choices in preparation, i go basic cheese with an egg (the dumb texan) but the big rock is great, and my vegetarian pals  say the black bean option is killer. the bird is worth your time."
4,"We had breakfast here, yesterday, and we loved it. Not knowing that it is better to make a reservation, we got lucky after a short wait: They had a table for us! The coffee was the most delicious coffee we ever had and the breakfast absolutely marvelous. I recommend the power bowl!I saw a recommendation here, suggesting that Americans wouldn't be served here, that is b.s.! If tables are empty, that just means someone made a reservation and will be seated there, soon. Our waitress was nice and friendly, the service prompt, we have no complaints. Americans are always very welcome in any German place, since they are known to give great tips. We are from Texas, didn't have any problems, ever!"
4,Delicious duck. Big quantity in the dishes. I will come back when I will be back in Hamburg
4,Excellent! Once of the best Thai meals I've had outside of Thailand.
4,"Very good food here, I usually take a haloumi and falafel teller with an extra 3 falafels as I'm a hungry hippo and they are delicious, you can tell pride is taken in the food they serve.The owner likes to practice his English with English speakers and is a friendly guy."
3,"We'd ridden the trains all day, toured Hamburg, and were hungry! The Nagel bierstube has great beer (Nagelbrau is a nice dark beer) and good traditional fare. The schnitzel is satisfying and the prices are reasonable. You could do a lot worse and walk a lot further. I was very happy, and so was my partner. Also, they have a full bar!"
4,"My favorite falafel place ever!!! I used to live in Hamburg and bike here often. My favorite was the falafel Teller box. So many delicious things on one plate. They make them in house and hot and fresh in front of you. I also like their mint tea. And they were always friendly even though I didn't speak German well. I live back in San Francisco now, but my boyfriend and his band are in Hamburg today to play a concert and I told him to go here! He has heard me talk about it a bunch!Totally worth the visit and it's in a great neighborhood w tons of rad shops near by."
2,"So yes, the coffee here is quite good (although I would say that it still is a bit short of 'excellent'), and yes, their cakes and bagels are very good. However, I would still not easily recommend going here, mainly because of service issues. First of all we had to wait quite a while before finally being served, while our waitress was chatting away with a friend and other wait staff studiously avoided us - and we only got served after we walked over to her and asked her to take our order, after which either she or the kitchen managed to get us the wrong bagel. Furthermore, it's crowded and noisy and you will be hard pressed to find a comfortable place. All in all, the quality of the food and coffee is severely let down by the service and ambiance."
3,"There's a reason this Hamburg Chinese restaurant has such a large Chinese, Thai, Filipino clientele; it's the real deal done well.  Reasonably priced lunch specials, good portions, tasty food, and comfortable seating are the pros.  Don't let some of the surly staff or sublevel dwelling deter you.  You're bound to leave feeling you have achieved preiswert!"
4,"Really good street food very good Chana bhatura - pretty fast service it's always busy so give yourself some time to find a seat, but I totally recommend i."
4,"The best pizza ever! Leave it to a little Italian joint in the Portuguese section of Hamburg to make the most mouth-watering, buttery slice of heaven. The place is tiny, crowded and noisy, but the waiters are charming and fun. When in Hamburg, you've got to try Luigi's!"
4,"It's like 5 stars McDonalds. Best meat, wonderful staff and modern enviroment. Best burger in town. I reccomend El Torro, burger in Mexican style."
4,"I visited on a Sunday.  You have 3 levels with different themes/periods and you start on the top floor.  Got here around 1 pm and not very many visitors.I really liked the simple descriptions of the car/items that gave you some good/quick insights.   They had a vintage Porsche drive simulator which was pretty cool.  This was quite popular and would imagine a queue during busy days.Although small, they have a good selection of mint or near mint condition vintage cars and concepts.   Really liked the 996 display showing 1/2 interior and 1/2 exterior.   Although they do have VW and Audi concepts, the majority of the display is Porsche.  There is a cafe with gift shop that has an good selection of books and model cars & some clothing.Only 10 Euros entry fee with a friendly and helpful staff.  Plan on 1.5 to 2 hours.  A must for any Porsche lover and enthusiast!"
4,"Probably the best vegetarian restaurant in Hamburg! Went there on recommendation by a local and was not disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious and the menu offers a big variety of creative dishes and drinks. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere nice and cosy. Highly recommendable, even for those who are usually meat eaters. If you're coming with a bigger group or around weekend, making a reservation would be advisable as it's highly frequented."
4,"A must for all Greek-food lovers! And it is so affordable! I recently was in Rhodes and comparing the food there and here at the Taverna -- I would say it can't get any authentic than this! My first time here I ordered the Calamari + Chicken soulvaki along with the white house wine -- best combination ever! The atmosphere is great-- really reminds me of Greece also with the loud conversations. The staff are great! We arrived but no tables were available so we had to wait but I believe who was the owner came over and accompanied us and asked if we would like something to drink while we waited! We were then promptly seated and the service is also very speedy here. What I would recommend is the Greek Bifteki -- it is ground meat with stuffed feta cheese, I think it is named differently on the menu-- just ask the servers!!! And with almost every dish you can get either french fries or rice and a greek salad.One thing that made me laugh were the napkins cause on the other side it is a mini-greek dictionary for you with phrases that I learned on my Greek trip!!! On our second time around, again busy as ever, no tables but we were then again asked if we wanted something to drink! This time I tried the octopus salad and the Grill platter (with assrt. meats) -- GREAT!!! YUMMY!!! But one thing I shouldn't have done was eat bits of the bread they place on the table -- the servings are plenty -- so you can always eat the bread after if you are not full from your main dish!Note to self: This place is very affordable (our bill for both outings for 2ppl plus drinks(bottle of wine and beers) and tip came to 25euros) and great location in Schanze! There are plenty of selections of meat, fish, vegetarian, pizza, pasta and salads. They also have some sort of German special also, just look at the daily special board. Oh and did I mention there is also a huge tv screen for all those sport lovers who are supposed to be on a date but can't keep their eyes off the screen;) I am going to try the moussaka next time and the guy next to our table had some sort of sizzling plate -- will have to try that also next time!! And perhaps if you are a big group -- make a reservation! Oh yeah you get shots of Ouzo after you pay! And the bill is not paid at the table-- you go up to the bar!"
2,Very big and quite impressive but once you've seen one section you've pretty much seen it all.
4,Slowly becoming my Stammcafe in Eimsbüttel- the thing I like most about Zeitraum is that its not too full or loud- on the weekends the cafe will fill up but you can still grab a table and concentrate on whatever book or newspaper you are reading. There are a lot of magazines and newspapers up near the front and on the way out you can grab a DVD two doors down from Filmraum (they must be run by the same folks). Drinks are good (very nice green tea and rooibos combinations) and prices are fair- I have not tried the food or the brunch yet but it looks like your standard Hamburg cafe menu and is mostly (if not all) organic so plus one there. This place would be really cool to rent out for a birthday party- I might just have to do that
4,"This place was amazing!  The place was easy to find and very cute inside.  They had an English menu; our waitress was amazing and spoke fluent English, and made great suggestions with the menu.  I had the Spätzle with cheese and bacon and my boyfriend had the special, a lemon and rosemary Spätzle - both were large portions and very delicious.  This was our first dinner in Hamburg and I would recommend it for anyone! I would recommend if you have a larger group to make a reservation ahead of time, as a good portion of the tables were reserved when we arrived.  They also have Wifi for anyone traveling."
4,"Usually portions in Germany are pretty huge and I am not able to finish them. That was not a case in this place, but not because the portion was too small. It was just so tasty:) Also, I definitely recommend Scweinemedallions mit käse:D Also I'm a big soup fan, so that will be my next thing there to try out, as for I saw they serve it inside big piece of bread.Should be tasty. They also have vegetarian menu, pizzas, salads and what else not, so there definitely should be something for everybody.Prices are really ok, too.Other than that this place is great because of its location and its really has that vibe, that you want to spend there all those rainy Hamburg evenings."
4,"Our favorite Chinese restaurant! Good service, delicious food, and quiet atmosphere."
4,"I love this place. Great for a date, for going out with your friends, taking your parents when they are visiting. It is better to reserve!"
4,"Skyline 20up Bar is located at the 20th level of the Empire Riverside Hotel. A lot of tables were already booked when we arrived and the inside is quite small, so I advise you to come early or book your own. The bar offers you a great view on Sankt Pauli, Altona and Harburg. Their cocktails are amazing and not like the usual ones, there is a good research on the texture, colour and presentation."
2,"All is said in Arril review. The surrounding is also great to walk with friends, play frisbee and enjoy movement of people and ships. I will always walk around when I have some time."
4,"Great pub and delicious food. Had grilled brandy chicken with yummy creamy mushroom sauce. My husband had the traditional fish and chips but without the chips and more salad. Got ourselves beer and shandy to finish our dinner. The food was just awesome, having to eat in a classic pub ambience."
4,"I came here on a recommendation by a friend that this was the best coffee in townI now wholeheartedly agree! The latte was so excellent, it made a Starbucks creation seem like a gas station cup of joe in comparison. Moreover, the chocolate chip cookie was the closest I've had to American style in Germany (although heating it up a tad wouldn't have hurt.) It's a small and cozy place, and rather quiet, which had a drawback: I had the unfortunate experience of encountering elderly clientele there who were reading newspapers and thus thought it was perfectly appropriate to ask fellow coffee drinkers to remain silent due to this. I can only hope they had gotten lost on their way to the library. Nevertheless, I can't blame the shop! A+ coffee here, even if just for a delicious to-go cup."
4,You want to eat great steak/food? Go here. I visited the Delta Bistro twice already and each night was an awesome experience. Try the tomahawk steak (800g). 60 Eur for that gorgeous piece of meat but it's worth every cent! The service is quick and friendly. 5 stars well deserved!
2,"Have been to the Ganghi on many occasions and every single time we have had a great meal with excellent service. The staff have got to be some of the most friendly people I've met. Nothing was too much trouble, they even offered to prepare a dish I couldn't find on the menu. This has become one of my favourite places in Hamburg, especially good after being on the road all day and you just want great food and to wind down."
3,"The best about this restaurant is the terrace and the view of the Hafen. When you combine it with a very friendly staff and great food, it's just perfect! We loved both their meals as well as desserts"
0,We decided to give this place a second chance.Fortunately we had the same terrible experience like on our previous visit.The food is still terrible and the staff has absolutely no sense for hospitality whatsoever.It's really interesting that the management just responds to positive feedback here on yelp but doesn't seem to care about bad customer experiences and / or how to learn from them.
4,"Good quality and quantity, best sea food in town. But if you go there during busy hour you may need to wait for a while or need reservation"
4,"Fantastic cafe in St. Pauli for sunny days. There's a little ledge outside you can enjoy your coffee on, and it catches the morning sun perfectly. Delicious bread, eggs, meat, cheese and salad. And nice people. Recommend."
4,"The food was really delicious, and the service couldn't have been much better.  My wife and I each had a different lamb dish, and they were both so tasty--tip: don't eat the whole lemon that is cooked in with the dish.  Gently press the lemon to get the juices out, and then discard.  We also had a desert each, which we don't usually do.  We weren't disappointed.  There was a saffron ice cream with pistachios on top--lightly sweet with a gentle perfume after-taste--maybe rose.  The second doesn't have an english word.  It very fine angel-hair-like noodles suspended in an icy sweet amalgam, and you drizzle a lemon flavor on it.  It also had a gentle perfume after-taste that came in after the sweet was done.  Teheran was a great experience--I learned more about my one meal than I've learned about food in a long time, and it was all delicious."
4,"After a short wait to get a table, the breakfast was simply sensational. The coffee was good, orange juice was fresh, and the granola was delicious. I then had the avocado and eggs in toast with Pesto - delicious. Would definitely come back here."
3,"This place is a standout for us and almost comfort food when we are in town.  This location is near the University and has diverse clientele. The bathrooms are clean and most of the staff speak English to some degree. Additionally, there are two possibilities for ordering: the normal sit down meal with cloth napkins on one side or the takeout/less posh tables on the side with the corner door.  We usually opt for the latter option unless it is a special occasion as it is 15-25% cheaper. Great place for a date or an informal business dinner. WELL behaved puppies are welcome as long as they sit under the table. The food is great and they have a Pakistani twist on some of you favorite ""Indian"" dishes."
1,"To summarize:1. Friendly but the person plays with his iPhone all the time2. Food is not good. Phó --- is not good, because the meat seems not very fresh. 3. Would still recommend for people who never had Vietnamese food. Because the environment is not bad for hanging out with a group of friends ..."
4,immer & immer wieder SUPER !!! Excellent & herrvorragend einfach !From the very best for the price !
3,"I don't know how I missed this place during the first 6 weeks I lived in Hamburg only a short walk away!Came here for lunch with coworkers. I ordered the Gyrosteller mit Mextaca sahnesoße, tzatski und pommes. Very good, large portions, great lunch spot. The lunch menu comes with a small salad, main dish and a small desert. In this case, dessert was a cinnamon rice pudding with brown sugar.Very reasonably priced at only €6,90 per person.The staff was friendly and helpful. Our meal came out quick and they checked on us during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed and to ensure that it met our expectations."
4,Clean and well maintained! This is one of the highlights in Hamburg! Worth to check it out for picture with your friends.
3,"Cooko is offering a Great vararity of Vietnamese and Asian dishes. Thus everyone should find something on the menu. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the dishes are freshly & fast prepared."
2,"Very disappointed. If you want to go for a brunch in Pauline at weekend, reservation is definitely necessary. The reservation list has always been long and it is recommended to reserve at least 4 days ahead. I've been looking forward to try their food because it seems so popular. However, you only get a 3-star hotel kind of breakfast for their 18.7€ buffet brunch menu. Totally a ruin of appetite and absolutely too expensive for such quality of food. The only good part of it is that at least you can make a nice Instagram style picture."
4,Very good restaurant if you want American food while in Germany. Terrific selection and superb taste. Lovely atmosphere and the bartender is a sweetheart.
4,"Still the best Italian place in Hamburg, together with other Vapiano's around the city. There are so many copycats lately coming out but this place keeps the standard very well and everytime when we go there it's a special enjoyment. Everything here tastes good, pizza, pasta, salads, bread..."
2,"Very touristic place, cocktails are rather sweet, then alcoholic. View on Harbor is good, but qui lift of service is average"
4,"Qrito, Qrito, how I love those burrrrritos.It's no secret... I love Mexican food. When we first moved to Hamburg, I suffered typical withdrawals in the form of hanger, flashbacks and weekly FaceTime calls with my mom that included talking about the beauty that is fresh guacamole.But then a silver lining appeared...One rainy, midsummer day, my job hosted a catered lunch from Qrito. With one bite, the sky cleared and rainbows formed in the sky. Mexican food. Cooked really well.Okay okay, theatrics aside... This place is A+. Definitely check it out.My personal recommendation is the carnitas burrito."
1,"The food was just about OK but what I was really annoyed is that there was a large group of people sitting next to our table making so much noise, laughing and chatting loudly. Later I realised that they were either friends or family of the owners. My point is that if the owner wanted a family get together, they should have closed the restaurant for others!"
2,"Crikey! All you can eat chicken wings! But only on Tuesdays and Sundays. Going with a larger group helps. Then you can try everything! Every order, of your all-you-can-eat wings, comes with about 6 or so wings on a plate. And they have 18 different flavors to choose from.I ate a ton here. Too much, I would say. So much so that I definitely did not want to see cooked chicken again on a plate for like at least a day or something. :o)My favorite styles were ""Germany"" (honey mustard) and ""Denmark"" (a special remoulade). All of the other wings we tried were pretty decent. The ""Thailand"" style was actually much spicier than the ""Australian"" one which was purported to be ""Hot like hell."" It's a pretty fun spot overall, especially for groups, and it's actually located below street level...or...down under!"
4,"Great customer service, cozy interior and excellent food. The food portions are big, so you will definitely not leave hungry.I had the Labskaos , which was delicious, and so were the pancakes I shared with my boyfriend. Totally recommended! 5/5 stars"
4,"Really amazing place. If you arrive early, you can look in the gift shop (lots of chocolate, recipe books, and chocolate related things). The auto museum is also nearby. I took the English tour and it was really great. There are a lot of chocolate tastings along the way (think every time you stop you try something) and our guide was extremely helpful in answering all questions and very interesting (and spoke very good and clear English). Making your own chocolate bar is very fun (and you can sample the add-ons). It's also really interesting to try the chocolate at all steps of its preparation. I would definitely recommend doing this if you're in Hamburg. Be aware that you have to buy tickets for the tour time you want online (no rescheduling). I've left out pictures of the samples themselves because it's more fun to be surprised by them."
4,"This bar seems little on the outside, but turns out to be pretty big on the inside. Besides the two regular rooms with cute tables and picknick chairs, theres another room in the back, just as big, great in case it gets crowded. The sunday breakfast buffet is probably the best Ive seen since living in Hamburg. Everything you can think of having for breakfast, big chance they offer it in here! And, last but not least, its affordable! I definitely will come back here, as my friends also recommend this place during the week, on every day evenings. Great to grab a bite, coffee, breakfast or relaxing afternoon!"
3,I had the fit plate. It was very nice... They have a great pepper sauce.
3,"A great roof-top bar in Hamburg, in the very center of the city. The very top level is open, so absolutely fabulous during the summer. The place is a bit pricey, but it's worth going there for a beer or a cocktail. In the evening, you might need to book a table.I highly recommend this bar, it's absolutely magic!"
4,"This spot is really charming; between the lit candles, fresh flowers, wife serving and husband cooking, this is exactly what one might envision when dreaming of European bistro. But let's talk about the food: Traditional Northern German. Unfortunately, I did not have time to research a lot before this trip, and ignorantly I assumed I would be limited to spätzle and sausage. Behold!  Labskaus - an old, traditional sea farer's dish, made from potatoes, pickled beef and beetroot, served with gherkins, beetroot and pickled herring. Labskaus reminds me of a non-greasy, light, almost fluffy corned beef hash. It was topped with 2 farm eggs and was divine. I appreciated that I was going to order a side salad but was advised against it because with the beets and gherkins, that would be too much. How honest! I finished with a spot of peppermint and ginger tea - fresh and strong. Between the reasonable prices, quality food and wonderful service, I would highly recommend this spot.Gluten free dining notes: The Labskaus does not contain bread crumbs, soy sauce nor Worchester sauce. Enjoy!The Creme Brûlée, however, is thickened with flour. :("
4,"This place really impressed me, the location is right in the heart of the city's Reeperbahn area. You can have live food cook right in front of you, it's a very novel way of eating which gives you a very different experience in eating. You can be as involved in your meal as you like or you can just let the chefs cook your food, there at 4 different stages and each one is excitingly good offering a wide variety of meats, even a Bar BQ section. Defiantly best to book first, as this place is very popular."
0,"Really bad cappuccino. We got a quiche each which was served with salad. In my opinion it was overpriced and not tasty.We went there because of the excellent reviews this place got, but i really dont see why this is ranked as one of the best brunch places in Hamburg. Not recommended"
3,"Morden restaurant setting supported by self-service menu checking and ordering system. You can also design ur own burger (e.g. no tomato, with sesame bread, with extra beef and etc.).I ordered a chili burger with homemade basil lemonade. Pretty nice beef meat and very well made chili sauce! The food and drinks were also serviced fast. I would definitely like to come back again!"
4,"A very enjoyable casual meal. We were in the area and found Scharf for lunch. While it wasn't an important criterion, the price of the meal was very reasonable. The food was well prepared and presented. If you're in the area, it's a very good choice. It may not be worth the time to travel there from a significant distance."
4,"I've already reviewed the London MASH restaurant so what more can I add here?Well, at the time of writing, this place was only a few weeks old in Hamburg. From my experience, these guys have really hit the ground running.The restaurant located in the smart and swanky harbour area of the city. From the outside and in, it looks and feels distinctly MASH. The glass front gives you views of the harbour but also opens up the restaurant and makes it feel quite spacious. The MASH bods have effectively split the space into two areas either side of the main doors and the cloakroom. The opulent bar is in keeping with the London offering - sleek, modern and stocked with a great range of spirits (especially whiskeys) and cocktails. The restaurant is is spacious and opens out into a second dining area at the back of the restaurant. So how does MASH Hamburg fare versus MASH London? I'd have to say, on this occasion I thought it was potentially better!! The service was faultless. As soon as they realised I was English, out popped the English menu and full service in English. The menu is identical but is actually even better value given that you pay the same in Euros as you do in Sterling. The wine list is also a hugely impressive tome which has to be one of the most comprehensive in Germany. The food was sublime. I ordered my regular; 600g bone-in ribeye, mac and cheese, creamed spinach and chips. Having only dined a week previously in London I had a decent barometer but this was even better. That is some compliment. As always, I didn't have space for a dessert. I'll be back in Hamburg and when I am, I will definitely be returning."
4,"**UPDATE 13/7* Music was absolutely fantastic in here last night! They really have an awesome DJ who doesn't want to bring it down till 7am, so we just couldn't go home! Plus 1 star from me, and highly recommended free venue for the 4-7 slot before you're off to the fish market! ********I really like this place, even more now I know they serve really cheap cocktails until midnight! It looks great empty, but you'll mostly see a heaving sweaty crowd of revellers. I'm not sure there are any fire regulations in Germany as I regularly see clubs/bars with more people than would be legally allowed in the UK, but, it's all good fun. Till there's a fire."
4,"The best Mongolian barbeque I've been to. Lots of choice of oriental starters, buffet main courses and the grill too. Also a great selection of desert dishes and ice cream. Very reasonably priced too.Friendly staff and a nice modern interior."
2,"If u r searching for a good cocktail bar, it's what u r looking for. Awesome atmosphere and nice drinks! But the food isn't so tasty. Good thing is they offer gluten free meals! I'll say better to go there as a bar rather than restaurant."
4,"Miniature Wunderland is the world's largest model railway layout, and makes for a super half day out for children (of all ages).Actually, it might be more accurate to say layouts: the exhibition area is an amazing 5,000m2, and there are rooms depicting Austria, Switzerland, different parts of Germany, Scandinavia and even parts of the USA (not the UK, though, alas!). And it isn't just abut trains: one of the most popular exhibits is a huge scale model of Hamburg airport, complete with planes taxiing and taking off, with all the service vehicles scurrying about, and even cars queuing for the car parks!It's hard to describe everything as there is so much to see  and it is as much about the details as it is the scale. As well as trains, planes and cars, there are trams, ski lifts, cable-cars, and even model ships moving through the fjord in the Norwegian section  where the water tank even has a tide. Some areas are on two levels, and the depiction of iron-ore mining town of Kiruna in Sweden shows the underground mine workings: kids seemed to love pressing the button that sets off an explosion. (There are buttons to press at various points to make things happen). There are football stadia and pop concerts taking place, as well as fairs and religious processions, all peopeld with thousands of 1cm high people. Oh, and the whole place regularly switches from day to night, when the twinkling of millions (literally) of LED lights gives a completely different perspective.My favourite cameo was a man chopping down a tree which then crashes through the roof of the adjacent house. The lady of the house then comes out and remonstrates with him! The control centre is also fascinating to watch (lots of screens controlling everything) in a James Bond-ish kind of way.Facilities include a cafe and large shop (of course). There are lifts between the floors, although a few sections can only be reached via stairs. You can reserve a timed entry ticket online  expect it to be very busy at weekends and in school holidays, so avoid these times if you can.There are leaflets available in English, although the buttons are in German only."
2,"Pony Bar is probably the undisputed No.1 bar in the Univiertel - which means that this is the place for you if you like a hip crowd, shabby chic and reasonably priced drinks. I went there for breakfast, which (I guess/hope) isn't exactly their speciality. The trouble started when it became clear that rolls would only be available 45 minutes after opening - on a Sunday. Service never fully recovered after that bad start and orders took their dear time to arrive. The rolls, once they arrived, were of mediocre quality, which should probably be expected given the rather low prices. Espresso, on the other hand, was excellent when the one waitress prepared it. Her colleague's effort some while later wasn't that nice. My advice would therefore be to go there for afternoon coffee or a drink at night, but not necessarily to make a detour for the breakfast. Unless you're a coffee fetishist, got a lot of spare time and are on a budget, that is."
2,"If nine floors of model ships floats your boat, you'll love this museum. If not, I'd give it a miss."
1,"I'm sure this is a nice place to grab a coffee or sandwich - at least it looks nice - but for me, it was one great disappointment.- The people working pretented to not understand a single word of my English and if they did, they answered in German. They also didn't look at me when talking to me and I basically didn't feel welcome at all.- The breakfast plate I had been so extremely looking forward to ever since I saw the photos both here on Yelp and on Instagram wasn't mentioned on the menu, and when I asked for it I was told that that's only for special occassions or special people (!).+ The caffè latte and little yoghurt bowl with granola I ended up with tasted very good.So Hej papa deserves more than one star because of the food, the location and the cute name ;), but I would never ever go there again. Although, if they'd offer me that breakfast plate.........."
4,"Just wow... A must see and well really the only main attraction found in Hamburg. It might appear childish at first, but its far from, its a historical masterpiece. Whether you'd like to reminisce over your childhood modeling years, or your world wanderer this exhibition of tiny animated models will take you back. Outside of your personal experience, this would positively impact your child's imagination offering mechanical and historical significance. Prepare for a 3-4 hour visit, there is so much content I'd advise review it in detail. In any case you will miss something. Great for English speaking visitors, and German natives."
2,"Pizza okay, Service langsam. Für einen Haps zwischendurch geeignet!"
4,"My long ambition to get onto more submarines is finally coming to fruition. I've seen 2 in a month! My fascination with these relics of the cold war stems mainly from enjoying ""The Hunt for Red October"" so much. U-434 is a Soviet vessel dating from 1976. She is a Tango-class (NATO designation) attack boat, armed with 24 torpedoes. Powered by 3x 5200 shp 6 cylinder diesels, she was, I believe, the largest non-nuclear submarine in service at the time. A German businessman thought it would be a good idea to buy her for around EUR1M in 2002, and she was transported back from Russia for a further EUR1M and now lies in Hafen City. Admission is around EUR12 with an extra EUR3 for the guided tour, which ou can have in English. I highly recommend the extra tour as you get to see areas of the boat (command room etc.) that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. Sadly, as she was still in active service as a training boat until 5 years ago, the Ruskies removed quite a bit of equipment from her before she was sold. Therefore, you won't be plotting a firing solution as the torpedo computer has gone, along with sonar and communications. For the most part though this is as authentic as it gets. One ping only."
4,"I've now breakfasted twice at Moraba, and have both times stayed after I finished to study. The best part of this place is their fresh juices  incredible. The breakfasts are also simple, but tasty. As for the local, it is very cozy, has functional Internet, and the service is always very friendly and attentive. Prices are also good for student life. I'm always very pleased when I come, and will continue to go there."
4,"Snacking might be tricky when you are trying to achieve your fitness goals. I finally stumbled upon the perfect option for whenever I want to cheat a little on my diet. This is by far my ultimate favorite relatively healthy snack in the world and I find excuses out of anything to go there and enjoy either a quarkbecher, a shake or frozen Quark.This time I had the ""Fit Macher"" which has sugar free Quark, fruits and Müsli. But I do recommend you try their more exotic flavors such as Detox Kelch with kale and chia or the ""Warm Up"". In Terms of location, don´t expect some fancy trendy Café or anything like that. It is really just a booth, but their product is amazing so don´t let that disuade you from trying it out. Also sometimes you can find them on Food markets or events around Hamburg. Just Keep your eyes open. You got to try them all!Mucho love,D."
2,"I only used to hang out with folks who would only go to Zoe II, then I tried Zoe III and I'm sorrybut they are exactly the same thing. Design, couches, bar, etc. Maybe I'm not a regular enough to appreciate the Sofabar rivalry going on in Hamburgbut really folks, it's the SAME bar just on opposite sides of the street. I'm usually pretty happy when I can just find a bench outside and some shade. Chill out spot, nice patio set a bit back from the street, good spot for a drink or two."
3,Amazing potatoes!! Definitely try the chilli and mediterranean one! The service was not the friendliest but the food is truly great and the place as such is also friendly
4,"Mr. Kebab is a turkish restaurant with an really accelent service. You can't compare it to the common opinion of turkish food, like Dönerbuden. Like I said, the service is brilliant and the food too. Yummie, really a lot and you can pay it. My advice: The Grillteller for two (it's enought for 3 easily even for 3 men) And: Got to the toilette there. It's an experience ;)"
2,Great spot for a lunch! Good menu and fantastic location. I had a great kebab here with fresh ingredients and great flavor. It can get very crowded during lunch time so make sure to have enough time to line up and get your food and you won't me disappointed. Great place!
4,"Had a veggie burger with two IPA beers, and sweet potato fries. It was excellent. The service was fast and the waiters friendly. The seating was outside and it  was relatively quiet. Excellent place."
2,On a nice sunny day its a good place to walk along the Elbe or to sit and watch the ships go by. you can also take a ferry over to Finkenwerder town on the other side of the river.
4,"Came here after a long walk around the city.  I sat outside on the picnic tables and ordered the seasonal special... a hamburger patty with white asparagus, potatoes and a big boat of hollandaise.  The best hollandaise I've ever had.  The meal was delicious.  Very friendly people that come here and the locals chatted me up even though I was a tourist.  Hamburg is great"
3,"Good coffee,  sandwiches,  and yogurts close to Marriott Hotel and much better value. Plenty of space and friendly staff."
4,Schnitzel was very tender and buttery. Falafel was full a flavor   Service was prompt and friendly
3,"So good I had to go twice in less than 24 hours! If you thought culinary creativity was limited to Heston Blumthing and his Fat Duck, think again. Had I had the good grace in school to bother studying German, rather than bunking off to mess around in the park, I might have understood what I was ordering. Luckily for me I didn't. Lucky, because I ended up randomly picking something from the menu, and it turned out to be a chocolate covered enchilada. Now normally I'd scoff at anyone eating chocolate covered savoury food, and probably top it off with some Rab C Nesbitt impressions, but this was one kick ass enchilada."
3,"Oh, this place is so great! It's a spice museum!You can find plenty of information about spices, their origins, their usage and how there were and are imported. The space is actually in the Speicherstadt, the largest warehouse district in the world, located right in the port of Hamburg.The museum itself is in a warehouse that used to belong to a spice trader, so it's the perfect location for a museum dedicated to educating and advising people on the origin and usage of spices. There are over 500 years of spicy history in this museum! You can touch and even taste over 50 different spices throughout the museum. It's an amazing visit for anyone who is interested in food preparation, history and spices.Also, the entry ticket is a bag of black pepper, so you're getting something out of this visit in any case! You can also buy spices and spice mixtures after your visit. I've been back many times and absolutely love it."
4,I'm so sad we didn't take a picture but all the food we ordered were all really good. Friendly staff and delicious food. I will definitely go back next time.
4,"This place is so cute and so cozy! Not to mention the food is fantastic, for vegans and non-vegans alike!The staff is also very friendly and accommodating."
4,"I love this place. It's nearby, is a classic bar, and the Polish owner/bartendar remembers every time that I am from Slovakia. Their food is basic but good...it's not a gourmet place, yet I've always been happy and never went home hungry. The bar is well stocked and they have a nice selection of beers I like. Sitting at the bar or in one of the ""cubby's"" each has its benefits and drawbacks. At times, the place can get tight as it's not that big. At the same time, it's very ""gemütlich"" which I consider one of the major draws for me. Finally, the Zwiebelkuchen rocks as does the Tzaziki. Both great companians to a good beer."
3,"Burgerlich is a Burger Restaurant close to Rathaus. When you enter the Restaurant you get a card, which you need to order your food. Within the tables there are tablet which you have to use to order your food. Be aware that you order everything seperately. The food is the served at the table. Before you leave the restaurant you pay at the exit."
2,"There are more authentic Lebanese/Syrian restaurants in Hamburg. The guys made quite an effort so it's a little bit of a heartbreaker to give them three stars, but it is what it is.The main problem is, that the food really lacks authenticity and yet it comes at a quite high price for what it is. Please trust me on this one I have travelled the entire Middle East and I know what their cuisine is like. As a real Hamburg Docker I'll give you a heads up and recommend looking for another Syrian/Lebanese place to eat."
4,"Since I'm an Asian, I dare to say this Japances Restaurant is very very traditional and their cooking is fantastic. Even they have Teppanyaki, there is not much in Hamburg. I'm sure I will try it next time."
1,"I must say that I am disappointed. I saw a few cakes that looked great on the pictures on yelp so we decided to have a break there and try two of these. But when we arrived in the store, none of these cakes were here, and actually none of the cakes present that day seemed interesting to us. We ended up taking one slice for two because we both couldn't find something that looked very appealing to us. We ended up with a hazelnut cake with a cassis icing on it. Unfortunately the cake itself was dry and the cassis icing wasn't really good either... We both didn't like it much (and trust me my boyfriend is a sweet-addict, it's pretty hard for him not to like anything sweet..)"
2,"First to make things clear, I am not a student nor on a budget. I've also had the benefit of eating steak in some of the best places in and outside of Germany hence my hurdle for quality meat is quite high. Hopi, located so close to my home, is unfortunately a disappointment. Having moved here recently I was looking for the occasion to try this place out. From the reviews here I was expecting to be wow'ed. Well, didn't quite happen. This is an older place and the interior is going downhill. Nicely maintained yet aging in terms of design. Even Block House with it's old school flair seems a bit more modern. Not a big deal though. This is a very subjective issue. Unfortunately where things went wrong for me was with the food. I had the ribeye steak. Prepared and served just like at Block House with the salad and garlic bread. The meat was horrible. I ordered it medium rare and it was gummy and bland. This was not good meat and if it were prepared by a gourmet chef would probably still not taste well. The garlic bread was ok but on the dry side. The salad very simple and the dressing forgettable. Don't get me wrong. For the cheap prices here, it's a good way to get your steak on. Once you've finished studying or received your first paycheck, it's time to move on. Yes, Block House is more expensive but the meat is consistent. Butchers, Meatery or the place in Afrikahaus are all better.On a side note, our waitress was super nice. We had the lady with the short, blonde hair and she really was a sweetheart. Unfortunately, the old guy (who I presume was the owner) was in the middle of a heated fight with the Asian lady at the end of the night. We were the last guests and these two really went at, insulting each other loud enough that we had ringside seats. We were amused but it didn't do much to lure us back in the future. ""Professional"" is defined otherwise."
4,"This is place is really good, delicious food, good ambiance, good prices. You have to try the crepe flambé, I want to go back soon."
4,"This place would have to be the highlight of our trip to Germany. The detail is amazing! I spent three hours there - would have spent three days if I had had the time! A tip: book a place online. You can print out a special timed ticket which gives priority entrance ahead of the queue, a great idea, and beats waiting! But you still pay only when entering the miniature world. Wow!"
3,"One of my favourite bars in Hamburg. Very friendly and sociable staff, comfortable sofas, relaxed atmosphere and great cocktails at reasonable prices."
4,"Possibly one of the best falafel in Hamburg! Really tasty!! Nice chunky vegetables and quality food for only 3.5 Euros. It's a bargain and you can eat in too, sweet little mezzanine."
1,"Great atmosphere, and they're very accommodating.   I ordered Nackensteak, and it was terrible, all tough and mostly gristle.  Not much to eat out of eat, but it was my first time eating Nackensteak, so maybe it's supposed to be like that.  I went with a large group and they were able to accommodate us all sitting together.  The salad I had was good."
4,"For authentic and traditional northern German cuisine and ambiance, Brodersen takes the cake. This place attracts more of an older crowd, but that shouldn't stop you young folk. This is definitely a restaurant that you appreciate for upholding tradition and its' sophistication. The interior design has a nautical scheme, and it creates a very intimate and romantic setting because of the dim lighting. If you want to avoid the romance and are looking for a more casual and relaxed setting, sit outside!I ordered the Schölle - Büsumer Art, which is with the Nordsee Krabben. Being a potato-maniac, the highlight of my meal was the Bratkartoffeln (roast potatoes). However, everything else was absolutely perfectly delicious. I have no complaints. Only conflict I faced at Brodersen was that I didn't know how to properly use the seafood utensils and how to de-bone my Schölle. But now, I do!Brodersen would be at the top of my list if I was visiting Hamburg. I would highly recommend taking visiting travelers and families here for dinner. It's food, atmosphere and design create a warm and lovely atmosphere. You'd want to share this experience with others!Side note: I found this place extremely comparable to a restaurant in Montecito, CA - Stella Mare. So if you're ever in town, check it out ~"
3,"Always lots of people in here.  You order your food at the till, pick it up once your vibrating pad tells you it is ready and off to find your seat.As English in Germany and with very little German, challenge here is reading the menu and ordering.  I don't believe they have an English version of the menu and I never get the sense that the staff have good enough English to help you out but, this is not a complaint on my part as why should they right?  I am in Germany after all.Once I have my colleagues translate and order for me, the food tastes fresh and there is lots off it.  A large bowl of pasta or salad freshly prepared for you and tastes great.I always eat in so not sure if they do take away also.  As with many establishments in Hamburg, I think they only take cash so be warned."
4,"YAY- After being to this bar countless times now already with friends or just on my own and constantly raving about how much i enjoy this place I finally decided today that along with my Latte Macchiato I'd ask the name of the bar as for the longest time now have been calling it Sofabar for obvious reasons. With a salon lounge filled with pre-loved sofas, some definitely from another era... this is undoubtedly Hamburgs most comfortable bar. This place is always at least half full even during the day and on some nights you may even have to wait to score a couch of your own, but with over twenty sofas to sink into and table service, this is an ideal place to come chillout, listen to some tunes, sit back and have drinks with friends. Not only is this a great bar with reasonably priced beers and drinks.... the coffee is worth coming for too! The great all rounder..."
4,"Ja ja der Elbstrand, was wir da schon alles erlebt haben , (als wir noch jung waren xD) haben dort oft gegrillt, (Party gemacht) uvm. Ach ja . ich vermisse die Zeiten total .. aber man wird älter und hat nicht mehr so die Zeit wie früher :( Schade eig. aber naja kann man nicht ändern :( Der Elbstrand ist auf jeden Fall total toll =)"
3,"This restaurant was a short walk from our hotel, so we stopped in for dinner.  The place was crowded, but we were seated upstairs right away.  We were also very happy that both the hostess and waiter spoke English exceedingly well.I got the schweinshaxe (roast pork knuckle) and my friend got a fish dish.  The potato dumpling served with the pork was probably the best I'd had in Germany, but the pork at the Schneider (Weisses) Brauhaus was much better.Prices were reasonable, the establishment is roomy, and we sat at a table for two (which is rare in some places).  Overall, a good dining experience."
1,"I don't know why this place gets such high ratings. Honestly, the guy behind the bar was totally unfriendly, I didn't feel welcome at all and he didn't use pleases or thank yous or anything like that, he didn't even point out that the kumpir on top of the counter was mine, until I asked him. Apart from the fact the service sucks, the place was a mess as well, the guys behind the bar just seemed more interested in listening to their music than keeping the place clean. The food was okay, I have to be honest, but it was expensive at nearly 4 Eur, where there are better bargains to be had only a few metres down the road to the right at Falafelstern, where you get great service and a huge falafel for only 3,50 Eur.I am sure the people behind the bar are not the owners, owners know how hard it is to earn a buck and it's a shame I have to resort to writing a review like this, the date I went was Sunday 9 June 2013 at 5pm. Maybe if the owner reads this he knows who was on shift that day and can fire them."
0,"Just had a dinner as a family of three at Khan. In short: I can not recommend.The meat quality is really low, hygiene is problematic,if you have a baby the only edible stuff is some chicken and sweet stuff.If you leave any food on your plate they will come and warn you and penalize you €5s per person that you did not eat all on your plate.Sorry, no one needs such a dinner."
4,Just discovered this place tonight. Very good Pho soups and hot ginger tea. Staff very friendly. Prices also very reasonable. Great to have such a place in the Innenstadt.
3,"Fantastic location and view, great drinks and  friendly staff. Go here on a weekday to skip the que and have more space. Viel Spaß!"
4,"Another cozy bar on schanze, where you can hang out any day of the week and drink some nice cocktails or whatever you prefer."
1,"Meh. If you're single and looking to mingle on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, Sausalitos might be a good place to start. Their drink menu is pretty impressive, but I found the Mexican food subpar. Not worth the money, in my opinion. On the weekends it feels much more like a club than a restaurant. I'd go again with friends for drinks, but I won't be paying for a meal again."
4,This place is so amazing. We got there at 8:45 am and there were no lines and it was not crowded. You will want to spend several hours looking at the incredible detail. Especially the airport!!
3,"We went for dinner on a Thursday and it was quite quiet, but this may also be due to the bad weather outside which doesn't really attract walk in customers. We had a three course menu with the accompanying wines and thought it was pretty good. The soup was very good, the fish was a huge portion and tasted good, but wasn't hot anymore. Dessert was a chocolate tarte which I believe should have been with a liquid core, which it wasn't The server was very nice and friendly, though a bit unsure at times. With better weather we would come back."
4,"Gorgeous restaurant with a delightful staff. I had weinerschnitzel, which was two giant pieces fried perfectly along with the best german-fried potatoes I've eaten. I didn't care for the cucumber salad, but my wife's fish pot of three meats, sauce and veggies was delicious. We each got a soup, one crab one potato and they were fantastic.  Really enjoyed the meal here and would go back if we were staying longer!"
2,Basically currywurst in a different shape while sat at a table. the deserts were great though.
3,"Reservations are suggested but they were still able to seat our party of 4 when we walked in. The menu is in German. We enjoyed fricassee of chicken, white asparagus (seasonal item here) with ham, and German beer and wine. You pay for water which is served in a glass bottle (natural or still means without carbonated bubbles). We appreciated that they notified us that they were out of certain menu items and had substitutes to offer (i.e. alternate beef and fish entrees)."
0,"Busy place - which does not honor table reservations. We arrived with a party of 20 - and had, of course, a reservation. We were told to wait outside, in a long queue. We left."
3,"A pleasent small caffe, ideal for quick coffee, tea and snack. Service is very much in portugese style, welcomy. Same as other portugese caffe in Lange Reihe, Caravela, they offer warm toasted sandwiches which is not easy to find in this town."
2,"Interesting concept than the one where you have to take off your shoes if you want to eat! Fear not though, you don't have to do this in the entire place. As part of a group we were offered a sitting area with low tables and stools laid out on oriental carpets, only area where shoes off are indeed required! Be geared up with funky socks, as it may make the entire experience more exciting! :)I'm not a vegetarian but always enjoy the variety of food and mixed vegetables on offer. 9EUR for a falafel with chips, side salad and a glass of wine, I say pretty cheap experience for lovely & much filling food!Why the 3 stars? Although all the staff was really lovely, the service was pretty slooooow. None of us really managed to eat at the same time. One tip: don't order red wine! But again, I'm French, my expectations may be pretty high :)"
3,"I absolutely loved this place. Was in Hamburg on business and was trying to check out some local restaurants that were also trendy. Went with 4 of my colleagues and we had such a wonderful time - the linguini was fantastic and the wine (Nero) was impeccable. We especially enjoyed the two waiters who were warm, helpful and full of life. Charming experience!"
4,"StrandPauli is a nice place, really well located. You can chill on the deckchairs resting on the sand and enjoy the cocktails. They offer free glasses of water which is a big plus for me, as many places don't want to, even if it is tap water."
2,"A Falafel place that is a bit more spacious so you actually enjoy sitting down and a bit cleaner than your average 'orient bistro'.Food quality is perfectly fine, flavours could much improve if they toasted the wraps / breads."
3,"Good service, good goulash and great location. Would recommend! We definitely will be coming back."
4,wirklich ein sehr gutes restaurant! pizza ist hauchduenn und einfach perfekt!
4,"This place rocks! A great beach bar with a great Hamburg vibe. It's more off the beaten track than the inner-city beach clubs, and the vibe here is chilled and ""real"". Try the matjes-brötchen (matjes herring rolls), they're lovely, and I get told by Hamburg colleagues they are some of the best in town. A real bonus is that you get the nice evening sun here."
4,"I keep finding myself coming back here. Gloria is a lovely laidback cafe style bar, with tables outside, really friendly bar staff, and great pizzas. I'm always surprised at how little the bill is at the end of the night too! A great place to spend a Sunday evening..."
4,"Those pancakes doe, for everyone who has been to Pancake-countries such as Canada or the US and then is craving for real thick yummy pancakes, needs to go to Mamalicious! This is the No. 1 spot for pancakes in Hamburg. I will never forget that day when I went to Mamalicious for the first time and a lady passed by and took pics of our food because it looked so incredibly gooood!"
4,"When I moved to HH from California, I thought that I would never find a bowl of guacamole, let alone a decent enchilada. Then I found Cafe Mexico. This is the real deal. The family who runs this charming cafe come from Mexico City, and they cook The Best enchiladas in Hamburg. The mole (a rich dark sauce made with chocolate, spices and nuts) is heavenly. The chilaquiles are great too...come to think of it, EVERYTHING is tasty here. And the tequila selection....yummmmmmmm. The decor is right out of Mexico, with the Virgin of Guadalupe and lots of cacti watching over the diners. Love it! And the service is just as it is in Mexico--mellow and friendly. Prices are quite reasonable. Cafe Mexico is a bright spot of sunshine. When friends say that they've never eaten Mexican food (or they think Mexican is just fajitas or Tex-Mex), we bring them here. I would eat here once a week if I lived closer to the Schanze!"
4,"Very warm atmosphere. The coffee is great, everything seems homemade and the breakfast is amazing. It's a popular place, so it fills quickly on weekends. Lovely!"
3,"If you are in Hamburg you absolutely must come to eat here, since the food here is the best!The food is so freaking amazing, the prices are great, service awesome and the ambience was perfect.I wish they could deliver to Berlin haha! I crave their bowl of pho all the time."
0,"YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT! What you get is 2 sweet girls who understand customer service and one male manager who does not!1. What we ordered 4 cheeseburgers and 6 orders of chicken wings2. What we got 4 cheeseburgers on english muffin buns? 6 chicken wings?!French fries made with old stale oil.  ketchup, mayo----oops no napkins?3. A manager telling me HOW IT IS - mam your order is wrong because you ordered wrong!! hmmm I rememebr in 7th grade business class 101 ""The customer is always right"" NOT HERE-THE BIRDFu*kUVERYMUCH for your service"
3,"Solid dishes, impressive drink menu, and good service.Our party of 5 went with the family style approach of sharing a bunch of tapas. It seems like the right amount is somewhere around 2 to 3 tapas per person, probably closer to the 3 end if you're hungry. Food comes out pretty fast, though, so you could always start small and order more later.They have a ridiculous selection of liquors for the size of the restaurant. If they don't have your favorite, you're just way too picky.For a busy Saturday night, service was remarkably attentive and friendly. Our waitress checked in on us a few times as our party arrived (they'll seat you even if your party isn't entirely here yet). We were there with German-speaking friends, so not sure how good the wait staff's English is.The inside isn't large but handles the noise very well. The tables are well spaced out, and we didn't need to shout to hear each other even though the place was packed.Prices are a tad high, especially with the cocktails. I'm still calibrating to the Hamburg market, though, so this could be on par for this kind of establishment. With a cocktail per person and 2 bottles of wine, we ended at just under €40 per person. Makes for a good special dinner spot but probably not a regular option."
3,"This is a lovely little local spot. Cash only. We went for breakfast and the server spoke enough English to explain the whole menu to us, and was really quite lovely. The bread is nice but not warm. The flavors are subtle - nothing really screams out at you but everything is nice. I got a plate with meat, cheese and bread and my husband got a tomato and salami scramble with bread as well. They go heavy on the butter here, which I like (it's served pate style so you can use as much or as little as you like). The food is fairly light. I wasn't hungry anymore once I ate here but wasn't super full either and ended up getting a buffet for lunch later. The latte here is an absolute highlight not to be missed. The foam is just perfection. No free refills on the coffee. All in all I'm glad we went but I wasn't impressed enough to go back a second time."
4,"I'm the fans of this restaurant as I was living around the corner of the it. I haven't been here for a long time after I moved out this district. I was here again for their Tuesday 3 courses Menu which costs €19,90. You can pick up either fish or meat on the main course. I was very very happy and satisfied as their cooking was no change at all, still keeping their high standard. I'm sure I will come again and it's highly recommended."
2,"The food is what one typically finds in Greek restaurants in Hamburg. The atmosphere is nicer than in many places, but often loud. It's a great place for a dinner out with a group of friends, but not the ideal place for a quiet dinner in two."
4,I found this Brazilian restaurant by accident and I found it awesome. Very friendly staff and the food super yummy. It's really worth the place :)
4,"Miniatur Wunderland markets itself as the world's largest model train exhibit, but it's a lot more than that. This place is incredible; all of the hype is absolutely justified.I don't want to spoil the experience for you (exactly the same words my coworker told me when she recommended Miniatur Wunderland, which I now completely understand), so I'll just give you a few tips for ensuring a great experience:1. You can and should make a reservation online before you visit. It's a little weird because you don't actually need to pay for this reservation; it's just some kind of ticketing system to control flow.2. If you're visiting on a weekend or a holiday, plan to go as early as possible, like between 8:30-9:30am. The place starts filling up with visitors around 10am and the experience is way better when it's empty and you have the place to yourself.3. The entrance is on the 2nd floor and there are lockers available for stowing your backpacks (1euro deposit). Take the elevator to the 3rd or 4th floors where the exhibits are. I was really concerned about ""where to start"" but in the end it really doesn't matter. You'll be impressed no matter what order you see everything in.4. There are buttons on the railing throughout the exhibits, which activate various details in the scene. Press ALL the buttons! (But really, some of them are quite delightful and you don't want to miss out.)5. Plan to stay for 2-3 hours...at least!If you find yourself in Hamburg you need to visit, for the child inside you. Miniatur Wunderland will bring out the wonder and excitement of the child you used to be."
3,"Delicious burgers and amazing cheesecake. They weren't really lying when they advertise the cheesecake as being the best in the world. Oh, and some pretty good beer here too.When it's crowded you can expect to wait quite awhile to get your food (like almost an hour...so it's best to be in good company and feel like drinking a couple of beers), but when it's not you'll receive your food in a reasonable amount of time.We've tried a number of burgers here, The Rock (my fav so far), the Filthy Harry, Da Woiks, The Jack (which has blue cheese dressing(?)), and the Dr. Zian. All of the burgers are served on toasted English muffins and the meat patties are juicy, flavorful, and as big as a baseball! The burgers are also served with a generous amount of tasty fries.My rules to adhere to when dining here: if it's too crowded then leave (unless you don't mind waiting a long time to get your food), but if it's not too bad and you can easily find a seat, then you should really dine here."
4,"This place is absolutely overflowing with character. Sandwich underneath the tracks, at some point most of the building slumped and settled leaving it all on an angle. The walls are safe, but look like they are about to fall over and are at a significant angle. The floors also are at an angle and depending on where you're sitting you'll find yourself leaning against gravity. You can even put an empty bottle on the table and watch it roll. The food is traditional northern German, with a slightly artistic flair. It was tasty and full of flavor with hearty portions. The burger was recommended by the waiter and was one of the more unique hamburgers that I've tried. It is a very small venue, with ample room outside for seating during summer."
3,"We just stopped in for a coffee and snack after a long walk, but was happy with the service and atmosphere. Would like to go back sometime for a more proper meal."
3,"I got 2 words for you: Go there (on a sunny summer day of course)the view is amazingthe location is perfectright on the alster with a view of the sailing boats!really breathtakinghowever the waiters are 'so-lala', service could be better, but oh well, with such a view you don't really care, do you?"
4,"Fantastic little restaurant!Great staff and food. We had a good time dining here. The restaurant doesn't have a menu but tells you the different food that day. There was no a problem making a vegetarian option for my friend, and they made fresh homemade pasta filled with pear. Never tried it before, but it was fantastic!The area outside (Hansaplatz) is a bit shady with people sitting outside drinking all day."
2,We went there as a small group. The place has a nice decor. They serve typical German food. The food is good but I didn't find it great. May be it was not their night. I need to be back there once more.
4,"Enzo's is around the corner from the place where we live and I came here last night with my wife for a pre-birthday meal.We had walked past the place many times but either not in the mood for Italian or it hadn't been open.So we walked in without a reservation at about 8pm and luckily got a table; 10 minutes later they were turning people away. It was nice and buzzy and fairly full with a mix of locals, tourists and business people.The waiter we had spoke German with such a strong, thick Italian accent that I couldn't understand him so we ended up speaking Italian instead! Once he knew I could speak Italian the whole experience became great; I told him more or less to choose for us then the food that came was really really fantastic.After respective starters of carpaccio and truffles & grilled squid in an octopus and black lentil salad my wife had rack of lamb and I had a Sea Bass with a salted crust. All with large glasses of red wine that we weren't told the name of but that it was 'buono' from the waiter!So it ended up being probably the nicest dinner I have had in Hamburg (maybe enven Germany so far) It wasn't cheap, at over EUR85 for two, however it would be hard to find nice food better cooked anywhere, plus the welcome, service and ambience made the difference between a good evening and great one.My wife and I agreed to go at least once a month, and I look forward to the next time.Enzo, Ci Vediamo!"
3,"For 21€ that's really a good deal. You will get more food than you can eat: the waffle was excellent, the orange juice freshly pressed and the Brötchen nicely warm. Moreover the place is extremely cozy. The atmosphere really makes the difference! Would totally go again to try a different breakfast option :)"
3,"Nice ambience and atmosphere; also friendly staff. Typical food selection chicken, Schnitzel, Currywurst and a bit of fish. The best place to start the night at Reperbahn having something to eat or drink. A bit more expensive than usually for this type of food, but due location it's worth it."
4,Delicious Turkish Kebap Meals are waiting for you.I can recommend every meal grilled on their barbeque. All Kebap Meals are Delicous **The Staff is very friendly **
4,It was pretty delicious ! Haven't had such a great falafel  in ages :) thanks ! Will be back soon
3,so far my favorite coffee place in hamburg! you can choose from two different types of (locally roasted) coffee beans and the barista seemed to know what he's doing. will be back!
1,"I used to love this place! Unfortunately the guy at the front desk has changed and I find him very unfriendly. I have had multiple disappointing exchanges with him in the few times I have been back this year already. The food has also taken a turn for the worse. Once when an item on the menu said cashews or raisins, it actually came with them. Now you are lucky if you get more than two of each. The vegetable portion of the meals now consists mainly of just onions (loads of them) and peppers. What happened to the healthy portion of broccoli, bamboo, coriander? Come on guys! Where is the love?! The restaurant needs real glasses, not plastic cups for our drinks. Lastly, the use of salt in all meals is excessive. I was a long time fan of bok but recently have only had disappointments there. I won't be returning any time soon unfortunately."
0,"Probably the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Rude, condescending and exceptionally slow."
0,"That was the worst food poisoning for mussels I ever had in my life, almost survived! Do not recommend this kitchen at all."
1,"In 20 years visiting Block House restaurants I have never had such a bad experience. It was so crowded, with a long line at the entrance, and you could feel the stress in the restaurant. Not enough service personal, food came slow, nobody came to check on us after we received our ordered dishes. The food was ok, but nothing super delicious. The children's dish (pasta with tomatoe sauce) was about the size of a table spoon. After we enquired about the size we were told there would be another serving. That never arrived. An ordered glass of wine only came after two additional requests. For the check we waited about 20 minutes without luck, and only when we left the table, and approached the front desk we were ""allowed"" to pay. Shame on Block House for such a bad performance. Might have to find a new favorite restaurant."
3,"What can I say about Loving Hut-Vegan?? First of all I am not a Vegan by any means but I followed some co-workers the other day for lunch and we ended up here. It is a nice, small location with a busy lunch crowd. When we arrived the place was fully packed and we had to wait about 5 minutes before we could be seated. Once we were seated it took a good 10-15 minutes before the waiter finally came over.I ordered the Thai Curry which was pretty good. For around 7€ I got the main dish plus a starter of my choice. I choose the spring rolls which were also tasty. Overall the food was pretty good, nothing to remember though. The service is what took this from a 5 star to a 4 star. There seemed to be only the 1 server and a lady who only cleaned the tables.I would probably come back though which is a good thing."
4,"A wonderful authentic German resturaunt. The cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and accomdating staff make for an outstanding experience. Do make a reservation!"
3,"Relatively pricey, but excellent food - we had steak tartare (mediterranean + oriental style), ribeye on the bone and new york cut, topped off with a lemongrass sorbet with vodka. All awesome, though steak was not the best I've ever had (reserved, for now, for the Hix Oyster and Chop House in London!). Only downside was a degree of pretentiousness and mild obnoxiousness of other clientele - not really the restaurant/bar's problem (apart from the high volume of the mediocre techno dj) - all of the waiting/bar staff were excellent and appropriately attentive."
4,"Excellent Hunan style food with an extra menu in Chinese: some customers were Chinese  always a good sign. I went there with a Chinese colleague and let him order. We had some great ribs, duck, lamb, chicken and also a Sezuan style spicy beef soup/stew which was amazing. Possibly the best Chinese food I've ever had."
1,I had a family brunch here on Sunday.Good thing is that they have lego and toys for children to play near the entrance.
4,"The coffee is ground exactly right, the milk is done to perfection and I even have a gorgeous little pattern on the top of my milk.. what am I drinking??? The most amazing, delicious, done to perfection LATTE!!! Finally! Who would have thought???!! I was almost having a breakdown thinking that the only place I could get a real latte was back at home in Melbournehowever, Swedish Cream has come to the rescue! It is a tiny tiny shop right where the Hallerstrasse U barn is where you can sit in or take away, and grab a piece of cake at the same time. The staff are really friendly and laid back, and efficient with their service. So even if you are in a hurry, there will always be time to grab a quick coffee to go from here!! I tend not to sit in here and have my coffeeit does not really have the atmosphere to make me want to lounge around, so I just come here to literally grab my coffe and go. However, many people like to stay in and sit on the stools at the window (while getting in some great people watching!!). The shop even holds classes on how to make coffee which is a great idea. I will be back hereevery dayhaving now to get up earlier just so that I have enough time to take the detour to Swedish Cream when driving to work!"
3,Cute restaurant with a great ambiance. Feels like it is lit by candles making it warm and welcoming. Get the potato pancakes!
4,"Delicious! This place was small, but with a great personality.  The food was great and they gave my boyfriend and I huge portions.  I had the lox bagel with eggs and he had a fried mix fish platter.  The menu was in German and so we just used Google translate.  The staff was nice, attentive, and spoke some English.  No wifi."
3,"Very cute Scandinavian coffee shop, restaurant and novelty store :) When you first enter, it is decorated with of course the sweet wooden red horses that I own at home which I bought in Stockholm.  The colors are also very Scandinavian to me, with pastels, lights and brights. To the right is a boutique that sells Scandy candies, treats and miscellaneous gifts or decorations.  Once can stop in for a Fika which means coffee in Swedish or even have a nice meal.  They usually have Köttbullar, but since most dishes are made fresh in the back in a limited quantity, you have to check with the waitress to see what is on the menu that day. When I came in here, I ended up ordering some Tagliatelle with mushrooms and a truffle sauce which was very filling! I had wanted to of course try a more Swedish dish or even the classic Köttbullar (Swedish Meatballs) but to my dismay, they were fresh out of meatballs that day.Hamburg is actually heavily influenced by Scandinavian culture being so far north and in their history, the Danes and Swedes settled in areas around here such as Altona for example, particularly because the Hanseatic League had some battles over shipping merchant ships and even a history with Pirates.....and Vikings! I had to learn about this history when I did an Elbe/Altona tour :)Come here for breakfast, lunch or dinner they have cute names for their breakfast menu with Scandinavian themes like: the Oslo, the Stockholm, the Kopenhagen, and even you can order the Aarus. They also have wifi here!"
4,"Don't skip this. Bigger than you think, with lots of attention to detail.  Easy access. Not suitable for wheelchairs (in my opinion) and the scenery switches from day to night very regularly. You can also have a view behind the scenes."
4,Sten is extremely friendly! Such a quaint cute little cafe.  The pastries are delicious you must try them all (:
3,"Durch Qype sind wir auf das Restaurant aufmerksam geworden. Unscheinbar von außen; klein und gemütlich innen. Ich hatte einen Tisch für eine kleine Geburtsfeier gebucht. Schöner, dekorierter Tisch in der Ecke mit Überblick. Herzliches Willkommen durch Frau Teichmann. Das Geburtstagskind wurde mit einem kleinen Küchlein mit Kerze überrascht. Wir bestellten Pannfisch, einfach köstlich. Der empfohlene Wein ein Genuss. Die Nachspeise  eigentlich war kein Platz mehr  war der krönende Abschluß. Das Sagners ist ein Spitzenrestaurant. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Trip nach Hamburg wieder vorbeikommen. Wir wünschen Herrn und Frau Teichmann viele Gäste und weiterhin viel Kreativität."
4,Great lil Surprise to find this Vegan Optional Middle Eastern Food. Farina at the counter was kind enough to explain everything to us in English & monitor our spending cz we only had 20 Euros in cash until I could find an ATM In Hamburg that would take my card. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this sweet lil Palestinian Cafe run by Farina & the Palestinian Family. ENJOY
4,"This restaurant is one of the top of the range in this district. They are not only can cook, they can also present their dishes very very nice. I'm wondering how they can have so much new ideas to cook all the time, like a magic hand.Of course you have to pay a bit more with those comfortable environment, sitting and so on but it is worth."
1,"The food was great..but the service was really bad..when we were ordering,the waitress was really impatient and a little rude..she was in a hurry and basically ignored the details we were telling her..we ordered a large juice and a small one was served..when we asked about it,she said that they never serve large juices (the last time we were there, i ordered the exact same thing in a large size, so it does exists..and we actually witnessed another guest ordering the large one and actually managed to get it) and we ordered chicken with pikant sauce, which then was served as a suß sauer one. When asked about the mistake, the waitress said that she didn't mess up..it is what it is..it is pikant and suß sauer (beides) and that we can't order pikant OR suß sauer, which clearly was a lie because the last time we ordered the same menu,it was pikant OR suß sauer, not AND. It had no pikant taste at all. How stupid does she think we are though..Seems like she lied to stay out of trouble. ( we ate it anyway because we did't want to create any fuss) When paying,the waiter actually asked whether i was going to give a tip or not..i honestly said no, because i was dissappointed in the service..it wasn't like we expected red carpet treatment or anything..we just wanted what we ordered (and not being lied to). After i said no, the waiter actually gave me a grunt which i found quite rude. Anyhow, i honestly think that the food was undeniably great. I can't lie about that. But it is better not to come there on busy hours, because this might happen to you as well. Communicating was a little bit hard since they didn't speak much german or english. So getting the right order might take some time. Something they clearly don't have the patience for."
3,High end steak house with good steaks from various countries and nice wines...though I personally feel they overpriced the California wines (I am from the US and know the California wine prices in the US).  Atmosphere is high end.  Interior is clean and nice.  Prices are high but worth the overall experience. Just don't buy the Cali wines.
3,"Great burger, but with slightly too many customisation questions from the waitress.Historically this venue has had problems with slow food service, but after visiting on a Thursday lunchtime they seem to have worked these issues out."
4,"This is exactly what a neighbourhood Italian restaurant should be. On a quiet street you enter down short steps into a small bustling eating area. We turned up unannounced lateish on a Tuesday evening. The Trattoria was full but we were all made welcome with glasses of prosecco while we waited. And it was worth the wait. Deciding to go with tradition, I had the Ossobucco, which was just as rich and flavoursome as I had hoped. Other traditional dishes taken included Linguine Vongole etc - all apparently also fully enjoyed. Highly recommended for small groups, friends and romantic meals."
4,Best quality Indian food around Hamburg.Love the way they received us...Kebabs and chef special fish fry is a must try..!Desserts & samosas are freshly made and tasty
2,"This is one of my favorite cafes around the area where I live. Coffee is decent (I generally have the soja cappucino) but their food is the real deal. Great to have a small bite or for brunching during rainy days. I recommend their soups and their vegetarian quiche. Additionally they have free wifi, making it a great alternative to Starbucks if you need a place to read or work. If you are in the area, check it out!Mucho love,D."
3,"This place is pretty good. I have my favorites in Hamburg when it comes to Currywurst but you can't go wrong with these guys, be it left or right side of the road or their newer location on the Jungfernstieg. The people are pretty nice and I haven't yet ever received a bad Wurst. It tends to be fairly packed which somehow adds to the charm. It wouldn't be the same if no one else was there. It is tough at times though to find even the narrowest of space to put down your plate to stand there and eat."
4,"Even if it seems that there is a lot of people waiting in front of the restaurant, you won't wait for a long time as the waiters and the cooks are fast and friendly, which is really convenient when it is your lunch break. I took a döner in a flatbread (for just 4,50€) and I really had enough even though I didn't take any side. You can either consume on the spot or take away your food, which is appreciable."
4,"Einfach TOLL !The food is great, the prices are really correct, the place is lovely and the service is perfect !Nothing to add but GO and enjoy :) !"
3,"We had a good experience at this restaurant. My husband had the original LABSKAUS and really liked it, I had SCHNITZELS with lemon and ate it all, it was delicious. Service was excellent and in English! The atmosphere was friendly and family oriented, we do recommend this place."
4,Très bon wine bar Olive jambon cru pasta et Entrées excellentesTrès bon vin aussiUn régalAccueil chaleureux et amical
4,"By far the best Irish Pub I've visited in Germany so far. The owner is from Dublin, half of the staff is also Irish native. Great pint of Guinness (or as they'd call it ""Perfect Pint""), great atmosphere. Make sure to try the burgers and baguettes, order Guinness and best drop in on a Thursday for the weekly pub quiz (not during the summer) or on a Friday / Saturday for the craic. Also worth mentioning: probably the largest collection of Irish whiskeys I've seen in a pub so far. However, no other than Irish whiskey is served."
4,After sitting here a full sunday afternoon recovering from the night before this place really showed its merits. The music was perfect sunday chill music and the choise between strong and normal apple cider was a true blessing.
3,"I pretty much lived here for a week while in Hamburg visiting it about four times and getting everything from Pizza, to soup and lots of coffee. Menu is extremely diverse and everything I ordered, plus what my friends ordered -- was tasty and hugely portioned. I enjoyed that I could sit alone and not be looked at strangely (see: my stint in Stuttgart) and service was much more attentive in any restaurant in Germany I've ever experienced. The location is splendid for Schanze people-watching coming out of the S-Bahn, punks strutting by or the alternative mom and her $500 buggy. There is also a wide array of trains going byif you're into that sort of thing."
4,SO FUN. Learned a lot! Would definitely do it again.
3,"I was surprised to see a concept like green lovers here in Hamburg. It reminded me of Mixt Greens in San Francisco.The menu includes suggested salads, a make-your-own salad option, soups, and panini. All of the salads are made fresh when you order. I went with the falafel veggie salad special they had advertised on the counter with the green lovers dressing (herbs, lemon, olive oil). It had a great balance of ingredients and a nice hummus on top. Definitely a fan.Service was also surprisingly friendly despite the lunch rush. Again, other than that whole ordering in German part, I felt like I had just walked through a portal to Mixt Greens in downtown SF.The only downside is that the space is a little tight and is pretty much packed by 12:30pm. If you'd like a place to sit and don't mind getting bumped into every so often, I'd aim for right before noon and stick to parties of 2. The line always moves fast and they offer takeout, so that could be a good plan B if you happen to arrive after half of Hamburg's workforce has."
4,"Unbedingt empfehlenswert!    Wir haben gestern einen wundervollen Abend im Restaurant Unter Deck erlebt.    Von einem sehr netten jungen Servicemitarbeiter wurden wir in Empfang genommen und an einem geschmackvoll eingedeckten Tisch platziert.    Nach dem Apèro, welchen uns der sympathische Mitarbeiter offeriert hat, sind wir in der gut gestalteten Karte schnell fündig geworden.    Schön ist, dass sich die einzelnen Gänge der vorgeschlagenen Menüs untereinander kombinieren ließen, da die Einzelpreise jeweils aufgeführt sind.    Weiterhin war die Zeit zwischen den einzelnen Gängen sehr gut abgestimmt.    Besonders hervorheben möchten wir den sehr freundlichen Service der beiden jungen Mitarbeiter, welche uns von Anfang bis Ende mit herzlicher Freundlichkeit sehr gut betreut haben.    Die servierten Gerichte waren geschmacklich gut und schön präsentiert.    Das Restaurant Unter Deck haben wir auf die Liste unserer Lieblingsrestaurants in Hamburg gesetzt, und kommen auf jeden Fall wieder."
3,One of my fav coffee places in hamburg. Good quality beans and coffee tastes good...you can buy their home rosted beans too. Service is good and prices are affordable! Check this place out- fav ones are cappuccino and flat white ;)
4,"My visit to Herr Max without a doubt was one of my Hamburg highlights. Friendly staff, ok prices, easy to find, great cakes and an extremely cool interior.It's hard to name Herr Max's style, but I guess I'd go for something like 'classic abandoned' or 'a long-forgotten castle', but all without making it a dirty or uncomfortable place. Absolutely not. I felt very welcome, and actually didn't notice most of the details - like the handdrawn skulls on every single plate on the wall and wall paper that looks like it's falling off - until I looked at my photos again at home. ;)They sell ice cream and cakes and although I'm sure the ice cream will taste great as well, I can only say: choose cake! Everything is homemade, looks (and smells) fantastic and the chocolate mousse cake I went for is amongst the best I've ever had. Because as soon as I took a bit, the topping got a bit more liquid and spread out over the whole cake as if it was sauce. SO DELICIOUS.Oh and they also have free wifi, fast enough to FaceTime (when you're a lonely traveler like I was) ;)."
4,"Excellent food and service! They were very nice and polite, it was an amazing experience. And the price is completely affordable. Excellent option for breakfast!"
4,"The ""Strandperle"" is located at the beach in Övelgönne. To get here - you can take the ferry from Landungsbrücken or the bus from the main station (approx. 20 minutes). It is one of the best places to chill out in Hamburg. You can buy lots of kinds of drinks and some nice snacks at the ""Strandperle""."
2,"A very standard place in Ottensen. Nice but nothing extraordinary. I am quite surprised at how often this place fills up. The food is average if that. The interior is about the same as 50 other places in Hamburg. The crowd is also your typical Ottensen hipster-wannabe. If in the area, stop in and grab some food but don't bring extensive expectations or foresee a memorable evening. Just a local place to grab food and beer."
4,"Karls is just awesome! I grew up going loads to ethiopian restaurants and having lots of ethiopian food so when the chance came to go along with a group to have some injera, I was immediately on that train.It is a small family owned and run restaurant that gives you a very cozy and homey feeling. Alex greets you with a smile when you get in and engrosses you with very interesting stories about origins and history of the food all through the meal as he brings dishes. He really cares about where his ingredients come from and its very evident when he speaks about it. On display are lots of spices, coffee, some baskets from Ethiopia and books next to the windows all centering round the theme of Ethiopia. Some of the coffee and teas are even available to buy.  We got a couple of mixed platters which came in the typical style I'm accustomed to. A large circular tray covered with an injera base with meats, vegetables and sauces on top for a couple of people to share together in a communal style of eating. Additional injera was also brought to eat. Everything was absolutely delicious from the bean sauce to the egg, mince etc. We all ate so much that at the end of the meal we had to seat back and relax for a bit before getting up. If that isn't an indicator of a great meal, I don't know what is. As it is both a cafe and ethiopian restaurant, also available are some cakes; the cheese cake looked good but I was just too full to try any and other treats you'd find at a cafe available.As we were in on a Friday night, we also got to experience the coffee making ceremony which they do only on Friday and Saturday nights so I'd recommend making a reservation and coming on those days if you would like to see it. The coffee beans are roasted as per the ceremony and coffee made for you to drink post-meal using the beans."
3,"Came here last night as we were showing some visiting family the Hafen City area and some great views of the harbour area.I have walked past a few times but not tried it here. So we tried it!All in all, a very nice Thai food experience. Nice and polite service in English and/or German, no fuss when we asked for simple non-spicy food (chicken noodle stir fry) for the children and then on opting for the 3 smaller set tasting menus (one each of A, B & C) for EUR33 got a wonderful mix of truly delicious authentic food.Only downside was the cost, but I guess in this part of town ( yuppie flats, business expense lunches and cruise ship tourists) it is what it is plus the food really is very good here.So for 3 set meals, 2 childrens meals, 5 drinks + service = not much change from EUR200 !!So all in all, very nice for a special family treat (but just not that often)"
4,"Fantastic restaurant. The food and service are exquisite, but served in a lively and warm atmosphere that could teach stuffy restaurants a thing or two.  The sushi was fabulous and the sashimi platters really zinging with freshness. Great combinations  of flavours from classic to fusion and  great portions, couldn't believe it was all for us to eat. Great for couples or for business entertaining and  can't wait to go back next time in hamburg."
2,"You really feel like you are on the beach. Wonderful but it remembers a bit on a package tour. Over all the prices. Too expensive. And going to the toilet costs extra.But the excuse is good: The view, the sand.. the summerfeeling."
4,"These cupcakes are absolutely fantastic. Even though I had them growing up as a child, they never tasted like these. The cake itself is very moist and the topping (icing/frosting) extremely smooth and creamy. I can really recommend them. EUR2,50 each is a bit much, but seeing that they're hand made and absolutely delicious - well, life is short and as they say, we're not here for a long time, but for a good time.Thanks for making my day, Happy Kappy. I'll be back..!"
4,"Wow! So good! Don't make the mistake I did when I was new in the city and eat at the bus terminal, walk about 5 mins to here and eat like a king. My favorite was Adona kebab."
4,"Fabulous!!! Friendly service, terrific food, beautiful setting. They made my husband, our toddler and I feel welcomed and appreciated. Plus the lamb! The wine! We can't wait to come back!"
4,"An excellent Indian cafe a short walk from the Hauptbahnhof. Don't expect nice table cloths and stylish service but the food is great. Also, check out their Indian sweets with a sugar content so high it should be illegal. It's strange that some if the best Asian cuisine is served in little cafés like this."
4,"Delicious, affordable, healthy options, very friendly and nice staff, and the place is super cute and cozy! Highly recommended!"
4,"Hands down the best meal I had in Hamburg.  And the best Spatzle I've ever had!  The restaurant is so charming. It's locally run and serves traditional food from Swabia. There are so many exciting choices to choose from. My friend had a tofu spatzle and I elected for the special of the day which contained spinach, feta, and bacon.  The noodles are SO FRESH.  The service is delightful. All of the ingredients are locally sources and handmade. The portions are huge! I cried a tear knowing that I couldn't bring back the leftovers. The wine is also very good. PLEASE you must go here.  They are excellent!!!"
1,"Relatively inexpensive Steakhouse like restaurant. Visited for dinner on Wednesday night at about six to 6:30 PM. Place was absolutely dead. This is a large well decorated newer type restaurant. I'd be very surprised if they were able to stay open more than another four months or so. When we left around 8 PM there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant. Seating at the restaurant would be hundred plus. There were two of us for dinner, my wife had a tenderloin steak, which she said was quite tender and fairly tasty. I had a ribeye steak that was extremely tough. The manager came over and inquired about our meals and when I indicated that the steak was tough he did offer to make another steak for me. That was probably the best thing about the meal. The side salad was run-of-the-mill. The baked potato was nothing special. In a city known for its potatoes one would think that the potato would be something extraordinary. Think again. Overall a rather disappointing meal. The server was a very nice Turkish lady, who tried hard to speak English and help us out. Although modestly priced, there are better places to spend your loot."
3,"Had a good lunch at ROK during their quiet opening. The procedure is to take a pager at the front, order and scan in the back, they page you, and then you pay with the pager. A little complicated, to say the least. Had the special pizza of the day, which was pretty tasty (see photo caption). Prices were a little higher than normal, but the atmosphere is nice, and food is good. Will be back."
3,"Best flammkuchen in town, but also pizza is very good  try the Diavolo  and it almost never looks twice the same, that's kind of funny. It's quite small so sometimes during lunch it's quite packed. Tip: if the old lady offers you cookies or sweets when you're about to pay don't refuse: she can get a bit upset and give you a angry look :)"
3,"Sundays around here don't have much too offer. Being first to wait had its merits though, because this place got packed fast.I had a L'envie with a cafe au lait. The crepe was ridiculously tasty. The cheese and ham tucked into the crepe with spinach and onion jam for toppings, then top it off with a dip into the egg yolk. Savory and delicious!The owner is French, but the staff regularly converse in German. English menus are a bit outdated in pricing at this point. Seating on two levels, bathrooms are on the second level too. Sadly if they catch on that you're from the US, they will push for an American sized tip."
4,"After tons of walking, we were in need of a break and decided to stop in for a late afternoon beer. The ambiance is quite lovely - hipster, but in the way where you enjoy it. Interesting architectural features, clean, and tiny little boat models in the windows. They have 4 beers on tap (I think 3 were pils and one was a wheat, all nice choices). Prices were reasonable and the bartenders were super friendly and were able to communicate with us in English (well one could, anyway). They don't take cards. They do have comfy sofas though to make up for it. Great music too. Make sure to come in and stay a while."
4,"The world's biggest model railway. Impressive. And around it, the world, miniaturized. It is quite an amazing experience going here, which is why we do it so often :) Crazy attention is being paid to detail, much of which you don't actually even notice on your first tour through. There is a hidden Atlantis part, there are a bunch of couples having sex hidden throughout the landscapes, there are undersea caverns with sunken ships... great fun to try and investigate every corner. The light installations are also lots of fun: in one hour of real time, the Miniaturwunderland goes through several sunsets, nights, and sunrises, during which the lights fade and change color and the lighting in the scenes goes on. Quite a sight, definitely recommended. PS: Make sure you reserve/buy tickets in advance, or you might be standing in a queue for two hours, during which you will get snacks and drinks, but still. Or come really early."
1,I was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Food was not better than normal Imbiss but more expensive. I won't come back again.
4,"Trüffelschwein is a restaurant that is well deserving of its Michelin star (I personally would give it two), and we have now been feeling extra lucky to know how close we live to it and how amazing food-art is just a stone's ""throw away,"" as long as their is plenty of ""disposable"" income lying around. ;o)In all seriousness, a meal here is without question worth the price tag and was certainly one of the best fine dining meals we've had. It is also definitely a place worthy of milestone celebrations so it was the perfect spot to celebrate my wife's birthday. There were a number of options for the amount of courses to partake in, five to be exact, and we opted for the 7 course degustation which really came out to 11 courses after the amazing amuse bouche and dessert extras.1st beef tartare-cucumber-gin: tasty and very well balanced, also came with two pieces of steak to grill on a tiny personal grill.2nd prawn-pork belly-couscous-saffron: excellently prepared prawn over fork-tender pork belly and savory fine couscous, it was one of my favorites.3rd stuffed cabbage-truffle-truffle jus: this dish was completely covered in decadent truffle shavings. 4th pineapple vanilla sorbet-champagne: excellent palate cleanser before the main.  5th iberico pork-truffle-celery-almonds: our main course had so many different delicious elements to it, my wife called it ""a journey on a plate""...apt.6th aperol spritz to eat: amazing frozen aperol with a lot of sweet and delectable surprises in it like fruit and candied things.7th frozen goat cheese-tarragon-white chocolate-olive oil: sensational dessert that was almost too pretty to eat and despite many of the savory elements, it was still quite sweet and was easily one of my most favorite desserts ever. 8th birthday cake!One thing I really enjoyed about our meal was the fact that we weren't really sure how everything was going to taste ahead of time. There were a lot of new flavor combinations and surprises for our palates which I really enjoyed.Overall, the food was excellent and beautifully and artfully plated. Service was fantastic. We both really enjoyed our entire dining experience and hopefully won't be waiting as long as we did to dine here again."
4,"We enjoyed our first lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe Hamburg so much, we came back the next day. It's always fun to see the different memorabilia displayed and the fun music selections. The host, Edwin was so friendly and personable. Our server, Nico was great! He was friendly and gracious. The food was very good too.  It helped make our harbor tour and trip to Germany even more memorable."
4,"Very good I had the big currywurst awsome a must visit while in Hamburg ,always packed"
2,"This place was weird. But then againanything is weird after drinking 1.5 bottles of wine before going out with your friends. Was there on a Saturday night and it was completely crowded and kind of sweaty. Someone grabbed my butt a couple of times, one other guy tried to put my coat on his girlfriend he was so wasted and in the backgroundGod awful euro-trance-house-crap that was pretty relentless. This was the upstairs. Moving onto the downstairsta da! We are now in the mid-30's zone complete with German style rap/grind/singalong antics. I don't know about you, but watching Berta and Hans get it on in their tight Euro jeans does something sad to your soul. Oh yes, another Pilsner bitte."
4,When did you last sit on a stove while conversing with someone on a washing machine? Exactly.
0,"I went here for food last night. I'd been before but only for drinks so was looking forward to trying the food. The place was busy enough for a Sunday evening. Sat down at the table at 5:45 and ordered food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly enough but then it went downhill. At 7:00 we still had no food. Our waitress noticed this and went to find out about our food and came back to tell us they forgot our order! As our hunger levels were high and we were in such a bad mood with the service we asked for the bill for the drinks so we could go somewhere else. The waitress apologised and didn't charge us for the drinks. In fairness, I don't think it was all her fault. There wasn't enough staff working for the amount of people in the place. All the staff that were working looked stressed out and were running all over the place serving people. This might have had something to do with their rudeness! If they had more staff working things would probably run more smoothly. I've family and friends visiting Hamburg next month and wanted to take them here but I'm not going to now. It's a shame because the place is really nice and the food that I did see on other tables looked really good."
3,"Love the outside sitting area, great view of the warehouses. Nice relaxing and quiet area away from the traffic. Friendly service, and the food tasted good. There was an English menu which was really nice, in the service spoke English as well. Really nice area inside too, but great for it outside sit on a nice night!"
4,"Love the ambience, nice n clean for local fine dining! Great food n wonderful service!"
4,"Top place! Absolutely a must try! Cool ipad ordering system, nice food ;) recommended"
4,"I see a lot of zoo in europe but this is my favourite! Animals live in large spaces and a lot of them could feel freedom in thepark. Indeed while u're visiting the zoo, u could bump into peacoaks, pelicans or goats and other cute animals. There are a lot of cute puppies that borned in zoo. This zoo has a secret..  At the entrance there a stand where some people give u a bag of vegetables. Here it's allowed visitors to tAke care of animals (surely vegeterian ones) and feed them. To take an example, u could touch elephants and give them beetroot! They love it!!"
4,"My dad took me to his favorite restaurant where he feels like home the food is always consistent and real delicious. The service in incredible nice and are super friendly The restaurant is clean and has a fun vibe My dad got a noodle dish and he loved it, my dish was super yummy (liver and fresh mashed potatoes with applesauce .personally like the weekly flyer they hand out so you know the dishes  daily.The service is super nice and friendly And the owner is very nice and helpful"
2,"Its is a small Thai/asia restaurant in my hometown back in hamburg, Germany.I was here before long before i used type/yelp. It is constantly ok'ish.It is not outstanding food but it is also not bad.This time i had fried wantan and i was really disappointed, a specialty in Germany is that the fried wantan are filled (that different to the us when i ask even my favourite Chinese spot, they never are able to make filled wantan, it don't really get why, cause in the WanTan soup they always use filled ones) - but back to my experience with Hee Yang, i was disappointed cause the wantan have been filled but with just a very, very small amount of meat. As main course i had chicken sweet and sour. It was a small portion (I was here for Dinner). The sauce was ok not outstanding and chicken just some pieces. On the positive side it was made with fresh ingredients like gherkins, carrots and pineapple. But as said not a lot, even the rice was a small portion. i was still hungry so that i had to order another starter so i had the satay chicken kebabs. The peanut sauce and the skewers have been very good. and i was happy that i ended with the kebabs. Overall ok, but for the small portion and mediocre wantan i have to reduce 2 stars. Just another point on the positiv side: everything (except the fisch sauce) is without MSGs. Immer wenn ich nach Hamburg zu Besuch komme in meine Heimatstadt ist ein Besuch in der Langen Reihe Pflicht. Ich war schon ein paar mal mittags bei HeeYang, diesmal war es 22:30 und ich war noch hungrig. So endete ich bei Yang. Ich bestellte mir WanTan, das besondere in Deutschland gegenüber der USA wo ich jetzt lebe ist das man hier die WanTan füllt mit Schweinehack, oder manchmal auch mit Scampis. Das wurde auch hier gemacht, aber so dünn und wenig das ich es erst gar nicht gesehen habe, geschweige denn geschmeckt :(.Nun weiter zum Hauptgang was ein knusprigen Huhn süß sauer war. Auch hier wiederholte sich eine übersichtliche Portion. Ich möchte beinahe sagen ich hatte gefühlte 10kleine Stücke Hühnchen. Die Soße war ok, mir gefiel das man merken konnte es wurde mit frischen Zutaten wie Gurken, Karotten und Ananas gearbeitet. Aber selbst diese Zutaten waren spärlich auf dem Teller verteilt. Die Soße selber war wirklich ok für meinen Geschmack, da hatte ich wesentlich bessere (aber auch wesentlich schlechtere). Nun sei es drum, ich war noch hungrig und habe dann die Satay Spiesse bestellt. Die waren dann 100% lecker und ich war froh das dies mein Abschluss war denn bei der Soße hätte ich am liebsten den Teller abgeleckt. Das Hähnchenfleisch war super zart und saftig perfekt gegart und eben einfach lecker. Die Spiesse waren mit Hähnchen und abwechselnd immer ein Stück Frühlingszwiebel gesteckt. Wenn ich wieder hingehe werde ich sicherlich drei oder viermal die Spiesse bestellten und woanders meinen Hauptgang holen. Die waren es wirklich wert. Dennoch am Ende des Tages muss ich sagen zwei Sterne gehen an den Geiz auf dem Teller verloren."
3,StrandPauli has a great location at the Hamburg harbour. Its a great place to hang out in the beach chairs enjoying the sun. The service was unfortunately a bit slow especially compared to the amount og people. And it would be nice with some heating lamps and blankets for sundown. Prices were reasonable. I'll be back!!
4,"Absolutely amazing ""all you can enjoy"". Don't worry about the limit, you will very unlikely get there. And it's so convenient to order your food by iPad."
3,"2 Euro party! This photo both takes the most fantastic pics for 2 Euros! Great way to start or end a party, either way you gonna look awesome. One down side, it's a dirty place!"
3,"Delicious and authentic buckwheat French galettes (crepes). The space here is lively, bright, and feels like that of a European country home-like atmosphere in a historical building that overlooks the canal. Good food and nice location...yeah, it's no wonder it's popular and why you should probably make a reservation.Both savory crepes that my wife and I ordered were delicious -- some of the best -- and prepared promptly despite how busy the restaurant was. I really don't think you could go wrong with any single one on the menu. We had some difficulty choosing because they all sounded very appetizing. We will definitely be back!"
4,Great Vietnamese street food style restaurant with a cool vibe! Definitely try the Vietnamese ice coffee. Ask for the spicy vinegar if you need a bit more tang. Recommended!
4,"A friend recommended that bistro so I had to try it out. They not only a wide variety of Galettes, they also have a nice selection of wines. My friend had a Galette with Gorgonzola and I had a Galette Begerre. The only bad thing was that some of the walnuts had to much of caramelized sugar but beside that it was very delicious and the perfect mix between savory and sweet.Highly recommended for good Galettes!"
3,"The tour is interesting but only moderately though for young children. The tastig of chocolate you get to do is kept to a minimum but you get to make one bar of chocolate which you can decorate, lots of fun, BUT only for a full priced ticket, not for a child ticket which is totally NOT COOL!"
4,"Everything is probably ordered from oyster to Zander here, which lives in such a way in the water. In addition a spectacular view of the putting on maneuver of the England ferry comes. A beautiful interior arrangement, and evenly this view, invite to staying."
4,Fantastic and classy bar. Excellent whisky selection and not too crowded. Staff are very professional.
3,"This place has pretty tasty food since re-branding. It used to be called something else and had a similar selection but different design and less outdoor seating. I usually get Müsli or Muffins to go plus coffee. At lunch they have great soups and salads plus a bunch of changing options. I've always been happy with the food. Unfortunately the place has become quite trendy and especially when the weather is good, a ton of people swarm it. Then it takes quite some time to get your food as service behind the bar seems disorganized. Nevertheless it's definitely worth coming for breakfast or lunch as the food really is good. It's all smack in the middle of town so a good option if coming in to go shopping or whatever."
2,"We went here twice in one day!  For dinner was actually because a handful of other restaurants seemed to be closed and we wanted a menu with a variety of menu options.  Earlier that Monday the whole team went here for lunch.  My german team told us that the pizzas here are huge, so one of my collagues and I shared a caprese pizza (they gave us both one half).  I enjoyed the fresh table bread they provided.  Service during the day was better than when we went at night.  The caprese pizza was alright, but had just one small little ball of mozzarella and one teeny basil leaf on each slice.  I would have expected more.  As others have mentioned, the toppings are on the sparse side.  I also ordered a side salad, so I only ended up eating one slice of pizza and taking the rest to go.When we came back for dinner later that night, they were very busy but we were able to get a table by the door.  I had ordered a tomato shrimp gnocchi dish, the girls had ordered an artichoke cream soup and a special crawfish pasta.  We all ended up sharing even though my main dish was the gnocchi.  The portions here are huge again, even more so with the pasta.  The gnocchi were very pillowy and filling.  I actually enjoyed the light cream sauce crawfish pasta more, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish.  And the artichoke cream soup was refreshing.  Again, since they were so busy, we had to keep asking for several things.  But it's honestly not a bad option for a cheap Italian meal.  Dishes top around 12-13 Euro."
1,"Borchers is a local bar and restaurant in Eppendorf, with a large dining room and an even bigger outdoor patio and sidewalk seating area. It's the kind of place that I can imagine has been here for years, and like a certain bar in Boston, everyone might just know your name.The atmosphere is nice, the service is friendly, and the food is edible, but none of it seems to come together into a cohesive dining experience for me.On one visit I had the Seelachs (pollack?) with potato salad, and on another visit I had the Wiener Schnitzel with white asparagus, potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. The fish was decent, but the Wiener Schnitzel was unremarkable, and the asparagus was overcooked.I suspect Borchers is a great place to sit outside and drink beer on a warm day, but the food is just not that good."
2,"Five years I lived next door to Die kleine Konditorei. I could have had these great rolls every day. Every morning and every evening.I could have hadBut I didn't have them every day. Not even weekly. The rolls are okay, but in my opinion it's not the manifestation of rolls worldwide there. Standing in line can be fun, I don't have to tell you. But standing in line over the street for rolls ? Only if you need buying rolls as your first event on a sunny sunday morning. So, dear English-Qype-Community, toast is all right and breakfast without rolls is all right too, even in Germany. But if you are homesick and you want to stand in queue you are welcome!"
4,"Entirely unique, weird, fun, and a must-see for Hamburg visitors with a few days to fill. This is what happens when you give a group of manic model train enthusiasts a few million to play with, and the results go from hilarious to stunning. Expect to spend a few hours on your feet, and not notice them go by. Usually quite crowded, so booking in advance for a specific time slot is recommended. A little restaurant/café with cute booths that simulate train seating is on the premises, so if you need to refuel you'll be set. Right next door to the over-the-top-animatronic-fest that is the Hamburg Dungeon, so it makes sense to pair those, especially if the weather's bad."
2,"If you have to kill an hour to 90 minutes because you arrive early Sunday morning and the hotel doesn't have your room ready, you can visit just so you don't sit in the lobby.  Check out the airport miniatures,  it is really cool.  Kids will love the place for sure but i wouldn't go out of my way to visit unless you just need to kill time as I previous stated."
4,"Great location situated in a boat moored on the harbour side. Tables at windows have great views. Good breakfast of bread roles,  cheese,  meats, egg and great coffee. Must be one of he best locations in Hamburg for breakfast."
4,"Amazing turkish place in the Hamburg city center...!!! Service is super fast, I really like this!! You can enjoy a huge choice of turkish food: donner, cous cous, felafel, rice, etc.Everything is so good and really cheep! Perfect if you want to enjoy a quick lunch with co-workers.Perfect for eating inside or for take-away. Please not that it could become crowded around 12."
0,Awful service. Rate 1star just because there is no option of 0star rating. Big disappointment
2,"I went there last week and i had the filet. To be totally honest its good but its not GOOD.It's average, unlike other comments i cant say its the best steak I've had nor that's it the best steak in hamburg And maybe they changed the cook since aLii's comment but my medium rare was not rare at all, it was actually almost well done. It was a hard piece of steak.But it's averagely priced, for 18EUR you get a salad and fries or baked potato which is ok! I also had their Bocktail vodka with russian berry! That was absolutely berry delicious :)"
4,"Excellent vibe and great selection of craft biers! Visited on a mid-Saturday afternoon. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and knew their biers. The pulled pork sandwich was also huge and probably one of the largest sandwiches I've ever had. I'll definitely return!"
3,"Bulgogi burger with extra cheddar, twisted fries and pineapple mint shake. Delicious, kind service although the home made fries my kids had were a bit flaccid. Lychee limo was to die for according to my 16 year old! Would definitely come back and try the other special burgers!"
3,Nice restaurant in a distinguished area of Hamburg center. Persian cuisine is well-known for its savoury dishes. Its worth the visit to enjoy the main course and their appetisers.
4,"I know it says it's the biggest miniature train exhibit, but it's so much more than that! It's the worlds largest miniature model, yes there are trains, but there is also a fully functioning miniature airport with planes taking off and landing, taxying to their gates and later taking off again. There are waterways with miniature ships going around. And so much built around the trains that they actually become more of a background and the main selling point. This place is stunning in its love to detail and the plethora of jokes and social commentary you can find throughout the miniature structures. Knuffingen, the made-up name of a city that's a large part of the exhibit, and Knuffingen Airport are only the beginning, there are also Austrian, Scandinavian, Swiss and American themed exhibits as well as a large Hamburg model. They are also currently building an Italian and a France themed area. This place keeps continually growing.If you look closely, you'll find so many amazing little details that are just so much fun to find. Keep a lookout for all the little cows hidden in every single exhibit! The American landscapes also have quite a few aliens populating their own little town.Many places throughout the exhibits feature buttons you can press to trigger some action, there's a joust, an outdoor festival, a Christmas market and so much more. Definitely take your time when you go here.Between the various areas, there are smaller exhibition pieces as well as information on the technical aspect. Every spare space in the Miniature Wunderland is used to perfection.The models are also updated according to current events, whether it's all of Hamburg celebrating Germany winning the World Cup or the train station being occupied by striking train drivers, the models keep on changing and it's wonderful.Always worth a visit, whether you're a local or a tourist! Also, they have Mario and Princess Peach on their restroom doors, so yeah, they're just really really awesome!"
3,Cafe Mexico is a nice little Mexican restaurant just to the north of the Schanze. I had the chilli con carne burrito and was quite surprised when something that I would have recognised as enchiladas was presented to me. Definitely different to the Americanised burrito places that are starting to pop-up around Hamburg. If you like tequila then (I assume) this is definitely a place to visit seeing as they have about 100 different types A nice touch is the complementary shot of tequila before you leave.
3,"I enjoyed this place immensely. In my walk back to my hotel, I needed to grab a bite for dinner. Found a fun outside table and ordered a glass of wine. Based on previous yelp reviews, I knew better than to order the nachos, but I didn't want to order a full dinner. I opted for the fried Camembert app, which arrived with a nice crisp basic salad. The plate had two discs of Camembert, which I found very generous. It was hot, crunchy and crisp and the berry sauce they came with went perfectly with them.The waitstaff was very friendly: disclaimer, I do speak fluent, native German so that may help a bit. But they were very easy going when I asked to move to get out of the plume of cigarette smokers. Price was reasonable and I left full and happy!!"
4,"Finally, I am glad that provide Vietnamese coffee yay! Hard to find Vietnamese larger in Hamburg, Germany!"
1,"Update: I'm going to have to mark Jim Burritos down a bit because they keep on disappointing. The food is generally still pretty good, although my last burrito was burnt from being left in the toaster far too long. I feel bad saying bad things about the place, but I think one member of staff in particular is rather dozy. She seems to have no idea who ordered what first. If she's on, you can walk in and order your food and then watch as streams of people who came in much later get their food first. Then when your food finally arrives (I have waited 90 minutes) you could very well be given the wrong order. I took two friends last week. We were the only people without food when we ordered, so I expected the three burritos to come quite fast, say in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes later, after watching plenty of other tables receive their food, we finally got ours. Mine was burnt. My friend was given a spicy one, when she'd ordered non-spicy. After a small complaint she was offered some extra sour cream. Instead of bringing it over, the staff went outside for a cigarette break. The sour cream never came and when we went to pay they had the nerve to overcharge us! Sigh. I still like Jim Burritos, and will continue to go, but I won't take visitors anymore, and I certainly will never go back on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday - they are just too slow.Old review: Pretty damn good burrito shop where the old Hatari cantina used to reside. We popped into Jim Burrito's last night - you've gotta try the new places, right? I got a beef burrito with guacamole for EUR6.50 (EUR5.50 without the guacamole). Their burritos come wrapped in tin foil, and so can be a bit of a pain to eat - I'd rather be given the option to have it straight onto a plate without all the foil. Anyway, the burrito was great."
