4,"Absolutely great food at the in house restaurant. The Chef made easy, healthy fare of the baked Perch fish with a creamy (basil?) potato side €13, green salad was super fresh €6 and tasty soda bread with a mustard honey butter spread. The hotel rooms are small but very nicely appointed, firm beds, goose down comforters and clean."
3,"Pretty awesome salads! Best I've had so far in hamburg. I had the 'Zeigenkäse' salad which is a goat's cheese and honey salad with some grains, cranberries and a mix of lettuce. I picked the sweet chili orange sauce. All in all a very good and very filling salad. All the ingredients complemented each other well. The large size is really large. I was pleased.About the place: It's a salad bar with the option of picking your base, couple of ingredients (grains, cranberries etc) and your protein (chicken, halloumi or goats cheese) and a dressing. Alternatively you can instead pick one of their preexisting salads. Basically your standard salad bar; these are unfortunately uncommon here"
3,Good food! And you can smoke in the restaurant inside only tell the owner you're wife or your sister is having a child in the hospital then it's ok
4,"This place is AMAZING! I lived in Hamburg for 3 months, and loved this place. The Durum Doner they make is made fresh all day. Juicy meat and amazing Tortilla like bread..... You will not regret going here, trust me!!"
4,Even if you are not a big fan of Absinth (my case) I still recommend you visiting this place. The owner will find something (out of a 200+ different sorts) that suites you. This is a great place to go and relax after a hard day at work or maybe just talk to your friends. If you are not aniseed fan then try King of Spirits.
4,"Excellent food and great service. It's in an odd location, but we came in 30 minutes prior to closing and they happily served us."
4,"Absolutely excellent! We sat on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant for an excellent meal. They brought us an English menu as soon as they could tell we were not German-speaking. If you're looking for the traditional German meal or something new, you'll find both. I had the traditional veal cutlet (weinerschnitzel) while my brother had a fish salad that was also fantastic. The fried potatoes with bacon were to die for. The bread and spread that they brought to start was also very good. A tad pricey, but worth it for a great meal, service, and people-watching location."
0,"If you live near the Schanze and are on a budget, you'll know La Sepia. Likely you've eaten there more than once; I certainly have. I've had acceptable dining experiences there (meaning nothing appalling), but mostly, the quality is mediocre or just a cut below. The service, as mentioned elsewhere, is slow, not attentive, and sometimes just plain rude. To sum up: if it's about the money, you might do all right. But if you can afford it--or if quality is important to you--go somewhere else."
4,"Less than two weeks ago we celebrated our wedding day at the Parlament's private room  the magnificent Rose Room. There aren't enough words or pictures to describe the beauty of the room. Please, try and go there and see for yourself, when we first went to see it our jaws dropped, we knew right away that that's the place we want for our wedding. It is an elegant, classic, ancient room that makes you feel in a fairy tale. From the info page: The Rose is the room in Parlament most steeped in history. Kings and ministers were received here and the daughters of Hamburg ship owners were married here. An impressive feature is the filigree ceiling painting and the imposing chandeliers. Being a sailor's daughter, this was perfect. But that's not all! We were looking not just for pure beauty, but also for a special place, for a small family and close friends celebration that will be able to provide us a vegan buffet (ya ya, vegan people get married too). The first step was to contact the lady who's in charge for private events, and wow, Mrs. Casper was absolutely amazing. She was super professional, friendly, available at any time, and the perfect person to count on for such a special day. All our special requests were fulfilled, the chef created a state of the art vegan buffet (all the guests were NOT vegan and were shocked and happy and thrilled realizing how tasty and rich the food was), the tables were set the way we wanted with our artistic cards flowers and funky confetti and our balloons hovered around, making the room even more festive at the end of the event we all went outside and send the balloons to the sky. The Rose Room and the Parlament staff contributed a great deal to the success of our day. We are grateful! Bottom line: if you are looking for a WOW place, professional staff, special menu and the best location in town  this is your place!"
4,"Had a veggie burger with two IPA beers, and sweet potato fries. It was excellent. The service was fast and the waiters friendly. The seating was outside and it  was relatively quiet. Excellent place."
3,"Excellent metaxa-giro, the fries are great as well"
3,"Amazing cute little restaurant. Ordered the meatballs, two different salads, hotdogs and the chocolate dessert. All really fantastic dishes with great flavors. Ambiance is great very Scandinavian with a ton of personality. There's big common tables, chairs, chandeliers and smaller wood tables for more intimates dinners. Overall this is a great place to have pleasant lunch or dinner."
1,"i recommend trying food that is not sushi here. last time i ordered sushi from their lunch menu, i found the tuna not fresh enough to eat raw. if color or smell of sliced fish have changed, it's a sign that it is no longer fresh.the atmosphere is good. the restaurant does not really serve Japanese food, the teriyaki menus they have for lunch use sweet&sour sauce and not teriyaki sauce."
4,"Cox was recommended by a local. That's clearly the best way. It's a beautify old building. High ceilings, glass open frontage plenty of natural light. No outdoor seating.  They don't need to be trendy, they are intimate and the food speaks for itself (in both a classic and classy way without attitude). I was brought bread with butter and a salt shaker to start. To begin I chose the cold roast beef with fried potatoes and not sure what dressing but oh wow ! Even at this stage it's clear that if I lived locally I would be a regular. This is where you bring a date to impress her (if she's a foodie) trust me it will impress! As I wait for my main I try another piece of bread yes, the salt does enhance the flavour. Also my very attentive waitress steps outside and charmingly slouches against the door frame to peruse the street for a moment before turning and coming back in. I really really like it here! I know I'm not writing a novel here but as I sip my German rose while sitting alone it's impossible not to drink in the atmosphere. The wine is delicious btw. Esp in this humid heat. My main was essentially Fish w beets but the menu listing was more eloquent.  When I was having trouble deciding on my main. When I asked her favourite the waitress said she liked this item because of its freshness. Very apt.  I'm not stopping there. (Btw I Never do 3 courses of dinner!) As I sit here enjoying my own thoughts I notice the couple in the (frosted) window table holding hands. Take note men, That's where you want to sit with your romantic dates. Dessert, well I'm not really a fan I just got carried away. The chocolate sauce and vanilla custard I think it was Accompanying were really delicious. The Tort was nice. Just not really my thing. Although I enjoyed the pastry casing in which it was served and the nutty texture. This was one of my stand out dining experiences in Germany. Highly recommended!"
3,"Very nice, however if you are British and used to hot curries make sure you opt for the hot chilli when they ask you, otherwise the Madras is pretty bland.Also for most people a small box is perfectly enough for lunch."
4,"It was a perfect place to drink a glass of wine leaving work! The selection of wine is really good and huge,  and the location is original, with a lot of flare... I only can recommend it!"
4,"Absolutely love this place!! From the outside it looks a bit run down and you may be even turned off by it but once you step inside you won't regret it. It reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in New York with its dark wood paneling, red tablecloths, and Chinese artwork. The staff is extremely friendly and next to all the artwork you will notice several new clippings with regard to China Golden. That's right, they have been published in newspapers, magazines, and much more. The huge menu has everything you could imagine and more. The prices are a bargain for what you get and what you get is a feast. The smells, the taste, and the atmosphere are to die for. I can't recommend 1 dish since I love them all as if they were my children but just trust me and stop by China Golden and see for yourself."
4,"Reason for this report:1. Personally, I am a railway fan and own a digital model railway in scale 1:87 constructed by Märklin of Göppingen in Germany. 2. Men and women differ much from each other's. Whereas men are mostly interested in technical stuff, women are more interested in landscapes. In this report I want to invite every visitor to Hamburg to go and see the ""Miwula"" as the Mini Wonderland call themselves. Additionally, I shall give a few tips. Owner:At the end of the 90s the Braun brothers Gerret and Freddy of Hamburg had the idea to build the world's largest model railway and to show it to the public against entrance fees. As they both seem to be ""crazy guys"", they have not only tried to be the largest, but also to amend unique highlights. Unfortunately I don't know any of them, I have seen them only on TV.Until today, their company has grown to as much as 100 employees.Site:The ""Miwula"" is located in the ""Speicherstadt"" (= storage quarter where old storage houses are located) on the 4th level of Block D on the street Kehrwieder #2. It can best be reached by public transport. The subway station ""Baumwall"" on the yellow line ""U3"" is only 10 minutes walk away from the ""Miwula"". For car fans, there are some pay parking lots available, which are quickly overcrowded on the weekend or during the holiday season. Waiting hours:Since the ""Miwula"" has opened in 2001, it has become one of the main attractions in downtown Hamburg. As it is only possible to see something if there are not more than about 100 people inside, the Miwula Management has decided not to let more than these 100 people inside. If there are more visitors, they will have to wait until other people have left again. On weekends and during the holiday season, it may happen that you wait more than an hour.VERY GOOD: as a spezial serviced the ""Miwula"" offers on ist website statistics about the waiting hours of the past and predict the visitors of the next days including waiting hours. Usually, there are more visitors around lunch time. NICE: on the homepage you can also find suggestions where to go elsewhere in Hamburg. What a pity that they have only two suggestions.Opening hours:Daily from 9.30 AM until 6.00 PM, on Tuesday until 9 PMOn the weekend from 8.30 AM until 8 PM. Especially in the evening hours the ""Miwula"" is highly flexible, also during special event like the Harbor Anniversary or the Football World Championship. Entrace fees:Adults EUR 9 (~£ 6 or $ 11.50), Children under 16y EUR 4 (~£ 2.70 or $ 5), Children smaller than 1 meter are free. They have a variety of rebates for seniors and groups and even yearly subscription cards. For a family with two kids the total entrance fee would be EUR26. I personally believe that it's worth its money. About the Traings and landscape:The ""Miwula"" only shows trains in scale 1:87 (which in Germany is called H0 = half nill), most trains go on the Märklin digital system with 16V AC power. In the US contruction part, however, the trains go on DC power system. Most visitors won't realize this fact, however this construction makes it impossible for the trains to switch between these two systems. On the other hand this is quite realistic, as you will hardly find US trains in Europe and vice versa.Every 15 minutes the lights will turn from white to red, then blue until they are switched off for a few minutes to simulate the night. Interestingly, the constructors have also achieved that the train and car traffic is reduced in volume during this time. It is a very realistic simulation of the night & day changes.Phase 1 of the construction reflects Southern and Central Germany and was constructed within eight months. On the 300 square meters there are 3 kilometers of tracks with 450 switches. 230 trains with 2,400 coaches roll over the layout. Already in Phase 1 the constructor were very successful to implement small scenes with much love for details. In one area you see prisoners escaping from jail, in another a loving couple in the forest, and yet in another some strike activities in a coal mine. As a further technical highlight, there are many model cars in the same scale driving through the many streets. It is always big fun when the fire engines get out to address a burning house or castle. Quickly after finishing the first Phase, the ""Miwula"" got quickly known and attracted many visitors. In November 2002, Phase 2 was opened showing Hamburg and the North German Coast line. You see the separate subway systems, street demonstrations, a Techno Move and many other fabulous details. One of the most important models is the making of the Hamburg Football stadium. Even the large screens in scale 1:87 work and can be illuminated in whatever direction. Ín December 2003 Phase 3 was finished: America. Here you can find Las Vegas with all its lights, models of the famous Big Boy - the largest ever built steam engine, you see temperature announcements on the highway in °F (instead of °C), and on Area 51 some"
2,"We found Al Volo on Yelp a few months back, while we were looking at an apartment nearby. It was cold outside, we were tired and hungry, and Al Volo's clean, warm, and well-lighted interior was extremely welcoming.On my first trip, I ordered the pizza affumicata (smoked ham and smoked mozzarella), which was really excellent. My wife is partial to the pizza piemonte (with black truffle cheese), and my daughter loves their kids' pizzas. The pizzas are tasty and come out of the kitchen quickly.On our second trip, I made the mistake of venturing beyond the pizza menu, which turned out to be a mistake. I love me some spaghetti carbonara, so I gave it a try. It was heavy, with overcooked noodles and a too-heavy sauce that stiffened after a few minutes. There was ample pancetta, but that couldn't help the situation.The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The dining room is casual and comfortable. Just stick to the pizza and you'll be fine."
2,"I came here the other day with my man to grab dinner in the area near his office as we were running errands. This place had good reviews on yelp so we decided to check it out. The offerings on the menu were limited and were kind of pricey so we decided to try the All you can eat (AYCE) option which was 17 euros per person from 6 to 9pm. The AYCE option came with its own menu so we wrote down the # of all the sushi pieces we wanted to try. The fish selection was limited and really only the salmon tasted fresh. We tried various nigiri (only 1 pc), hand rolls, big rolls (theres only 2 roll options (one veg and one not)) and maki rolls.The tuna did not seem fresh at all and seemed like it was sitting out for awhile as it had a dark discoloration to it that I was not used to seeing and it didn't taste fresh too. The place is pretty small and fits a handful of people. The place was about half full and I think the table behind us also did the AYCE option but ordered everything off the menu so the service for our food took a lot longer then we expected. After we finally got our first round we did place and order for a couple more rolls and it seemed like it took longer then expected again as there were only 2 people making the rolls behind the counter and I believe they were making for the rolls for the larger table behind us as well as a bunch of take out orders that came in all of a sudden.All in all, the price is a good deal for AYCE sushi but the service was extremely slow and the menu options were too limited for me to be coming back here anytime soon."
2,"Been here a bunch of times at this point. I always get the Döner Teller to go but most of my colleagues get the regular Durum Döner. One way or another, the fresh bread in this place is super tasty. The meat is also usually quite good. Unfortunately, the service here is extremely hectic and not at all customer friendly. Actually super annoying is the process of ordering. You pay, get a ticket and wait. No one really makes much of an effort to find out what you want and if full at lunch, it's chaotic. Further, the place is a dive. Each of the many guys behind the counter is covered in grease stains and sweat. Hand washing seems to be a non-issue and I am concerned about these guys touching my food. Finally, the restaurant itself is filthy. It's not inviting from the outside and the interior is quite repulsive. In summary, the food is actually tasty and the bread is the best part. Unfortunately, you have to risk food poisoning when eating here. I do admit at times I say f""§k it and just go for broke. You only live once! :-)"
3,"Greatest bun bo hue! Beefy broth with a little kick to it, but not too much. Comes with bean sprouts on the side. Yummy! If I lived here, this would be the place to get my fix. Skip the prawn spring rolls though, pretty boring and flavorless. Tra da tea good but a little pricy."
2,"What I like about this place:1) they give you unagi sauce and mayo with the soy sauce which both taste great! 2) The sushi are Creative and pretty overwhelming in taste. What I dislike:1) The Service and staff is absolutely ridiculous. I understand you guys got some fame now though online ratings but the staff truly doesn't give a shit about you. First time we came we asked if the kitchen is still open if we come in 20 minutes. They said yes, we arrived in 15 minutes to find out their kitchen closed. No apology, just a ""well you've to come earlier"" (but I just talked to you on the phone). Second time we came 2 orders were taken incorrectly and they made us feel guilty about not telling them right away when we got the sushi (well, it all looks the same to us) 2) The sushi quality is middle class. Don't go with the nigiri you'll be disappointed. It's not worth the price. Conclusion: if you like fancy special rolls, you love it when it's saucy - this place is worth to check out. The taste of the special rolls are great! If you care about having a good experience or authentic or quality sushi. Skip this place. Note that parking is a catastrophe! What we ordered and liked ranked from most favorite to least favorite:1) Unique Lady roll (was good!) 2) Crazy Man Roll (nice Sauce that tastes a bit like Marmelade) 3) Hot Strong Tempura roll (would skip) 4) Crispy dream roll (definitely skip)"
4,"First bar I went to in Hamburg and don't need to go anywhere else. It's amazing. I did my washing, drank weird Germen shots and was so drunk I had to be escorted home."
2,"Amusing evening in this cavernous new St Pauli Sushi place.The deal is, you pay a fixed price and can stay for two and half hours, order 10 items every 20 minutes, so there are a few limitations. We were told that it is very rare for anyone to order the full amount, potentially 200 items! But it has been known to happen.Each table is equipped with a red ipad, you order and the dishes start arriving thick and fast, 10 at a time. First we went for salads, all very fresh and delicious, particularly the seaweed salad, and I made a mental note to have more. Twenty minutes later, we ordered the next round, this time warm dishes, all very good and very fresh as you would expect from a place with this rapid a turn around. Highlights were grilled fish.Next round, more or the same, some of the grilled items were delectable, yet came in small portions.Still going strong, we started on the sushi, here there was a slight difference in quality between the hand rolls and the smaller sushi, which I suspect were machine made, so we opted to continue with the fresher hand rolls.This continued until the fifth round when our appetites began to flag, but hey, you do the maths 5 rounds equals 50 items per table of two. No small achievement!Drinks were slightly expensive, but they had some excellent beer on tap.With an offer from Groupon, the total cost of this feast was just over Eu 30, not bad I would say.Service was friendly, efficient and informal.Bottom line, this is not really a sushi restaurant, more of a Pan-Asian, fun house! Don't go there expecting Sushi artistry, you won't find it. What you'll find is a lively venue for a fun evening! Great for a small group, I'd say.I'd go again, but only with an offer!"
3,"I went there for lunch and ate one of the day's specials - a plate with rice, salad and turkey meat with vegetables. The food was tasty, cooked just right and the portion was exactly big enough. The line can get huge during lunch, however, so don't plan on a quick 5 minute trip here if you're going for lunch during the week."
4,"What an awesome spot to sit and have a meal or just a drink or coffee/water on a nice day! An especially great spot to stop if you're cycling around the lake. Good prices, decent food, friendly service, but most of all the vibe can't be beat. Totally cool to be out there on the water. Like hanging out on a boat without the rocking. Clean bathrooms, too!"
4,"One of my favorite go to spots. This very unpretentious yet really delicious restaurant is one of our staples. From the great pizza with crispy crust and mozzarella (instead of Gouda) excellent Italian wine selection and the best family owners in the neighborhood, it is definitely worth a visit. If you plan to be there on a weekend or busier night, definitely reserve or call ahead to ensure a table is available. Guten Appetite!"
2,"I was hoping to see the (low) standard of service that we encountered in Bavaria get better as we dined in Hamburg but it was not so. Service here was definitely slow and not very attentive. Our waiter spoke fine English and that part of the meal went well, but engaging him to get our order placed was a bit challenging.Yes, they have a printed menu. It's in German. There's also a list of daily specials on the board, written in German that we could sort of read. Google Translate doesn't work well when you can't work out what the letters are. And then, there's another list of specials that the waiter has in his head, which is... interesting.I let him talk me into a mushroom salad starter which was unusual and quite delicious. A variety of grilled mushrooms, shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Enough for two to share.For main course, I chose the spaghetti vongole. Very good, a plate of pasta tossed in olive oil and garlic and then topped with cherry tomatoes, clams, shrimp and other seafood. Other than the pasta was perhaps a little underdone (or my taste for it is off?), it was delicious and I ate nearly the whole thing. Keto? Not today!My friend had the pappardelle with a beef and veal sauce. She said it was delicious but pointed out that there was no parmesan cheese to be had anywhere. And once she pointed that out, it was strange. Our waiter wasn't to be seen after the food was delivered so after waiting a bit, we decided to dig in. By the time we spotted him, there wasn't much point.So what could have been a five star meal dropped to just three because the pasta was underdone (in my opinion) and the lack of service which just left us underwhelmed.Note: There is Trattoria da Enzo and they have another Trattoria Due Da Enzo around the corner.[Review 12053 overall, 1836 of 2019.]"
3,"I give Xeom a solid four stars. It would be five, except that I really like Vietnamese noodle bowls (Bun), and theirs is pretty mediocre. The noodles are extremely thin and flimsy, and clump together in the bowl. If you like soup (Pho), though, then you're in good shape. Theirs is delicious (I had the chicken soup). There isn't much spice in the food, but there is a bottle of Sriracha on the table if you need a kick.The menu is pretty standard Vietnamese, with the aforementioned noodle bowls and soups, along with some salads and other specialty dishes. They have a large selection of drinks; I had the lemonade last time I was there, which was nicely presented and delicious.The dining room is small and cramped, and they're frequently packed for mealtime. We arrived around 12:30 for lunch and didn't have trouble getting a seat, but it gets packed around 1 PM. The chairs are all stools, and there are no coat racks, so you kind of have to make do if you have a coat with you.The staff is nice, and seems to all speak English, in case you need an assist. The prices are very fair. Overall, one of the better dining options in the city, just wish their Bun was tastier."
4,"Really good street food very good Chana bhatura - pretty fast service it's always busy so give yourself some time to find a seat, but I totally recommend i."
4,"My wife and I stopped here for dinner after work one night. I've only been in Hamburg for a month or so, but this is easily the best burger I've had in my time here. I got the BBQ Bacon Burger and my wife got the Zillertaler Bacon Burger, and both were fantastic. Her's was a little heavy on the sauce, but that didn't really detract from the burger other than to make it messier. Prices were also totally reasonable.They've got great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice. They even project whatever is on TV outside as well, so we were able to keep half an eye on the F1 qualifier."
4,"This is by far the best lamb/chicken/kebab I had. Authentic place with shisha space, live music and delicious food. I recommend the grilled meat for 2/3 to share."
3,"This place is crazy. So many details and special effects. If you like trains, building stuff, or if you have a kid this is the place. It was a little to crowded for me. Many kids and parents. They have minimiced citys over the world and they make it possible for you to see theese in daylight but also at night. This place is big so make sure you have time to go trough all rooms. They serve food and theres toilets. Costs 16 euro per person in entrence fee for adults. There are parkingspots near and a parking house."
4,"We got there pretty late, probably 30min before closed. Still a lot of people there. It is really popular. I had shrimp pho, and my friend had no 7. Both are pretty good. Wanna try the drinks next time. 很好吃，并不是特别地道但是融合的很不错，下次还会再来。想尝尝喝的，看到别的桌喝的，看起来很好喝"
4,"A very nice hidden cafe;  if you're somewhere around you should definitely visit and sit outside! (As long as the weather allows that is). I enjoy their quiche and breakfast menus, their friendly staff  and good service"
4,"I've been traveling in Germany for 2 weeks and this is the best flat white I've had so far! Double shot, right amount of milk and foam. Very velvety! The dark chocolate cookie was also great! The baristas are super nice, made recommendations when I was having trouble decide what to get (their menu is large!). Nice interiors and outdoor seating. Free wifi which is great if you want to work."
3,"Nice coffee shop, really small place though. Dark, wood-heavy interior, friendly staff. homemade pastries, lunch menu. 1 hour free wifi via tMobile hotspot, charge your batteries, people, outlet costs .50 per hour extra! Cardamom & nutmeg shakers - you fancy, huh?"
3,"Beautiful building and scenery, really good to discover different types of tea. Only slight problem is that it takes a bit of time to get the bill. Would def go again!"
3,"Suntan o'clock! It really is kind of like being on a real beach, except you've just walked from your house and you can't actually jump in the Elbe, just see it. A relaxed vibe, decent seating/cushions if you get in early, and a nice bar that will even serve Weissbier with a straw - totally tropical. My only gripe would be the amount of cigarette butts in the sand. So no 5th star. Still - something very different and cool to show off to your English friends!"
3,One of my fav coffee places in hamburg. Good quality beans and coffee tastes good...you can buy their home rosted beans too. Service is good and prices are affordable! Check this place out- fav ones are cappuccino and flat white ;)
4,Sten is extremely friendly! Such a quaint cute little cafe.  The pastries are delicious you must try them all (:
0,"The food was delicious but the service was absolutely terrible. We came in at 5pm and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant, so understaffing was definitely not an issue as we saw many other customers (including the table next to us who came in after us) catered to in a timely matter. First off, they took an incredibly long time to get back to us (~15 mins) so we had to ask the waiter for the menu, to take our order and for the desert menu. The only thing we didn't have to wait 15 minutes then ask for was the water that they initially served us. The final straw for us was dessert. Not only did we have to ask for the desert menu after waiting around 15 minutes for someone to take our plates away, we also had waited around 20 minutes for someone to come take our order for dessert, at which point we both gave up on this horrendous service and decided to just pay and leave. We waited around 5 more minutes to see if anyone would acknowledge us, and to no surprise, no one had came over. We had to walk to the cashier to pay. The whole meal took almost one and a half hours and we only ordered one main course each since we gave up on dessert. I honestly think the Currywurst Kiosk on the Reeperbahn has better service.‍"
0,"Im really dissapointed about this bar..First impression was ok, nice atmosphere, funky interior and good sounds.After 5 minutes I felt like leaving as soon as possible.Its way too packed, dancing is almost impossible, and the 50degrees temperature doesnt feel like any festivity either..The music is good though, charts mixed up with good tunes, house/rnb style. Among the crowd students and older, lost tourists tried to get drunk and create themselves a good night out.Mine was everything except that.. When this old lady with yellow glasses and 60s jeans started to dance like a fool..she must have been on drugs, although that must be a weird combination as she looked like a lost schoolteacher from kindergarten, I had to move myself at least 1m to the left, just to ensure myself not to get involved in her wild expressional, private dance. After my friend Kat almost got smashed to the ground and hurt her knee by some drunk fat yuppies, we decided to leave... I wont be back. But I probably visited Hörsaals worst night..."
4,"On my recent visit to Hamburg, I had a need for a good lunch.  Something other than a brat or a schnitzel and boy was that need fulfilled when I ventured into Luigis.   Oh boy, I had no idea that such good Italian food could be found in Germany.My first venture was simply a pizza lunch with a glass of wine.   Well that salami and mushroom pizza was one of the best I had ever experienced.   I have always held Pasquales in San Francisco to the number one pizza but now I think I have found a close competitor.  Awesome flavor and my wine glass was really like a fishbowl filled 2/3 full.   Thank you...My second venture was two days later wherein I experienced their spaghetti frutti-deMar.   OMG....OMG...done to perfection!   Very very good.   If ever I am in Hamburg again, I am going there for sure.Oh and the atmosphere is sort of eclectic and the tables are almost like shared in some areas with outdoor seating to be had as well.   Nice place!"
1,"After trying this place twice I can't honestly say I would go back. The food was ok, not great, but ok. It seems that kidney beans are quite expensive as I never seemed to get very many in my burritoWhat was bad is the waiting. It has both times taken a little longer than 1hour. The argument is that it takes 45 to bake them. There are faster ways that are equally good, if not better. Only go there if you don't have any appointments afterwards"
0,"After this place opened back in the days it was absolutely fantastic and showed great hospitality.The food came in good portions, was delicious and only high-quality ingredients were used.Unfortunately they cut back on almost everything. The food is just average, very boring and nothing special at all really.I guess the only thing I can do is remember the good old days..."
3,"Morden restaurant setting supported by self-service menu checking and ordering system. You can also design ur own burger (e.g. no tomato, with sesame bread, with extra beef and etc.).I ordered a chili burger with homemade basil lemonade. Pretty nice beef meat and very well made chili sauce! The food and drinks were also serviced fast. I would definitely like to come back again!"
3,"I have to be honest, this location is the main and probably only Vapiano's I really frequent in Hamburg.  For some reason, I do not stand alone when I say this is the most popular location, as it is not just the food that brings people here, but strangely enough, it is also the most social of locations. On most typical nights, you are crammed onto tables with strangers eating cheek to cheek, elbow to elbow. I mean, at times, we even have to battle it out to hang our purses, coats, scarfs, etc on the hooks that are just not enough to go around.  And do not even try to set your jacket or bag on a chair to store it, thinking that it will deter people away from sitting next to you.  NOPE, major failed plan.  This is Germany, they simply say, ""Ist hier Frei?"" essentially translated into, ""No human being is occupying this chair right? Ok, then please remove your personal belongings so I can plant my hungry butt down.""  Yep, Vapiano's is a hustle.  Hustle to get a tray, get in line, get your order in, get a drink, or stand in a separate area for alcohol, and then good luck getting back in line for dessert later.  Even with all this fuss, we all still go there... The food is not of the highest quality, but it is tasty and moderately priced maybe even considered cheap to the non student crowd, and the atmosphere is somehow posh-casual.  It is kinda like the Starbuck's of Italian Pizzeria food chains, not just in Hamburg, but even when I was in New York City, it is always a similar story and routine.  Local Tip: Go here on Thursday night. For some reason, that is ""the night"" at Vapiano's on Hallerstrasse.  For some reason, people like to be seen here on that night.  I guess it is because the week is almost over and people want to get ready for the weekend, so they come for cocktails, since it has decent food, and is near the train stop, it can bring people living in the areas of Harvesthude, Eppendorf, Rotterbaum, and even Mitte together simply because it is off the U1 Train.My favorite salad is the steak one with shrimp, a bit of surf & turf.  As far as pasta, I love the curly noodles one that has a bit of a spicy beef tip/tenderloin with mushrooms and rucola, and a creamy tomato sauce, yummy.  To drink, if I am not drinking my liquid antioxidant of choice, Red Wine (good for the blood!), then I take usually an Orangina, since it has a cute genie like bottle and a fresh citrus taste to it that goes lightly with any meal you choose, whether soup, salad, pizza or pasta."
1,"I know salt is cheap but how much you need to put into the dishes? I really can't tolerate it, way beyond my average intake. I think the food is authentic indian food, unfortunately I can't enjoy it. By the way, service is awful. When I asked for a vegetarian dish recommendation, I immediately get impatience from the waiter. I know they don't live on tips like being in America, but come on, I'm a customer and what I got right back from him to my husband is ""She's difficult""The two star is for the atmosphere"
3,"Azeitona's charm comes from its rundown but cozy establishment. Great place to eat really cheap and really good food. I had the mezze for 2 and It was wonderful. My personal favorite: their hummus! The place is perfect to hang out with friends, but it's not that big...so don't plan your next birthday party over there. On the downside, staff might have been very friendly but they were rather inattentive. Also, I had a pomegranate lassi which was not nice at all. It was small and way too sweet (taste was rather artificial). If you want to drink something opt for tea. Other than that, I can't wait to try another dish. Mucho love, D."
3,"Really cannot believe it took me so long to try this restaurant! Grabbed take out on a Sunday - and it was de-lish. Next time I will call ahead, but there is no menu online that I am aware of. We had Duck with Peking sauce, Wonton Soup, Chicken Chow Mein and veggie rolls. All good. Looking forward to our next Chinese Sunday pick-up!"
3,I have heard repeatedly from my internal monologue as I walk past cafe May that they do good cocktails of an evening.  I have yet to experience them.  10/10 review. Would read again.
4,"Wonderful place. The food was delicious and authentic, and the woman helping us had a great personality and was very helpful (and she spoke excellent English)."
3,"Keep coming back for the fried noodles and of course Vietnamese Ice Coffee! The restaurant can be very packed during lunch time or dinner time. I don't know if what they serve is authentic, but I'm pretty sure it's tasty!"
4,"It would be easy to walk right past this little place--I did just that the first time I was in the neighborhood! But don't do that--you want to eat here. This place is a lovely little gem.I came in around 8 on a Thursday night and took one of the last seats in the house. The atmosphere was great--lights low, wood fresh, good music (Jimi Hendrix, among others). It was easy for me to focus on the book I was reading, which was really nice.I couldn't make up my mind, so I picked the Knoedeltricolore and a glass of zweigelt. The zweigelt was the best wine I've had so far in Germany--smooth, slightly jammy. When the knoedel arrived a bit later, I had to take a picture because the three colors looked so pretty.For the three colors, you get a beet, spinach, and cheese dumpling. I believe all of them had ricotta inside--don't quote me. All of them were good, but I may have preferred the beet to the others. I ate my meal about as slow as I could, really trying to savor each bite. The salad that came with the dumplings was much better than your usual side salad with nice, fresh lettuce. I would go back here again in a second!"
2,"I was here already few times and every time I ate Sushi. This time I tried out Ramen, Ramen is a kind of Japanese noodles in soup. However, they said it's Korea noodles in soup in their Menu. Anyway I tried out. I was totally disappointed. It was like a kind of instant noodle then put some veggie and beef. The soup was no taste at all and the beef was very very tough.There are wide range of choices in their Menu.  I can say some restaurants try to increase their choice in their Menu but a lot of dishes are not up to standard.  I came across there are some restaurants are only selling one kind of food but there are long queue in front of their door. This restaurant made very good Sushi and why they don't concentrate on the food they are strong with ????In any case, I had reviewed my disappointment with the witness and they told me their boss is a Korean and not Japanese."
0,Location is great! On the beach with a stunning view of the harbor!Food and service is ok. But they only accept cash!!! In this day and age not acceptable.
4,"I've had mixed grills here and they were very good,  but what sets this place apart (and please don't confuse it with Gazi Antep, which is on the same block)  are both the döner kebab and something most westerners never think of trying,  the işkembe çorbası, also known as 'panzensuppe' or tripe soup.A brief word on the döner kebab (which I get in the dürüm döner form, where the bread wrap is thin like a flour tortilla):  for some reason, it is, for me, the most consistently satisfying rendering of the classic German version of the classic Turkish kebab sandwich.  The combination of meats and veggies and flavorings has always been perfectly balanced.But now for the something remarkable, the işkembe çorbası.  Everywhere else I've had it, and I do mean everywhere,  there is far less meat, and the flavor tends to be way more dishwater.   The işkembe here is loaded with both substance and flavor.  You can get it with garlic, which means a spoonful of a garlic sauce,  and then add red pepper flakes ('urfa biber').  You can also indulge in free veggies (like onions and whole peppers) on the side. Not only is it the best işkembe çorbası you can find,  but this is one of the most delicious and satisfying  soups you'll ever experience.Köz Antep is on a nice, leafy, out of the way street;  it is close to the 'Dom' fun fair;  it is a bit of a walk from public transportation (S-St. Pauli, or the Reeperbahn),  but for me that walk whets the appetite something enormous."
1,"Meh. The broth had little flavor, the noodles were over cooked, and too salty. I've had some great pho other places, maybe Hamburg you should stick to other things."
3,"Reizendes Restaurant mit hervorragender Küche mit österreichisch-französischem Einschlag. Für ein intimes Date sind die Tische allerdings zu nah beieinander stehend, und außerdem trifft man (leider..) jedesmal auf Bekannte dort, was den lauschigen Abend ebenfalls erschweren könnte"
4,"Great coffee! So many different variations, and a small selection of cakes. Very small coffee shop so it can get crowded but they also have tables and chairs outside."
4,Clean and well maintained! This is one of the highlights in Hamburg! Worth to check it out for picture with your friends.
2,"We went to Le Xich Lo for a late Friday lunch.. I had high hopes for this place because I enjoy food from the region and always prefer authentic restaurants.The waitress was not at all friendly. It was quite obvious that she'd rather have a short of break at this time than serve us. I even had to reason with her why I would like to have some more chili sauce.The food wasn't really a highlight either. The soup was luke warm at best and tested boring. For a national dish I'd expected a bit more. As a starter I tried frog legs which weren't impressive either. They were totally over-seasoned and chewy. The 3 stars are for the Mango Curry my wife had, that was actually very tasty. The only plus for this place."
4,"One of the best zoos EVER!! This is our annual tradition in Hamburg, and we would not continue if the zoo wasn't so spectacular!!! First, feeding the elephants is the most amazing thing. Second, being right in with them lemurs to the point where they jump and sit on you is craziness. The aquarium is top notch. Feeding the baboons is crazy fun for kids of all ages, and finally being face to face with the lions is an experience you can not miss. I would not miss this zoo if you are in Hamburg. Worth every penny!!!!"
2,An OK version of an Aussie bar where you can drink VB and Fosters. The food is quite good: wings are the house speciality in many many sauces  not typically Australian but good. A bit out of town but walkable from Dammtor station.
4,We were staying nearby so decided to try it out. We liked it so much that we ended up coming here consistently our entire short stay in Hamburg. Staff is incredibly friendly and the space is minimally but very nicely designed. I tried both the cappuccino and flat white and preferred the cappuccino. The carrot cake is the best I've ever had. Ever. The cake itself is rich and not sweet with a wonderful texture and the frosting is buttery and delicious. Perfect! Will return the next time I find myself in Hamburg.
3,"A pleasent small caffe, ideal for quick coffee, tea and snack. Service is very much in portugese style, welcomy. Same as other portugese caffe in Lange Reihe, Caravela, they offer warm toasted sandwiches which is not easy to find in this town."
4,"I fled in here from the rain today, drenched and quite unhappy with the day. Had a breakfast Linz and some absolutely perfect coffee, very quiet today, lovely music, friendly service! Now I'm ready to face the stormy weather again :)"
4,"What a blast! Really enjoyed this place.  Got there early (0930) and was pleasantly surprised how few people were there already. Spent about an hour just looking through all the models and by the time I was leaving there was of pretty good crowd of people coming in. So I was really glad that I got there early. One thing I was not expecting was all the interaction that you could have with the models they were buttons that you could push to make certain models move. Of course, as a pilot, the airport was my favorite display and I could've spent a lot more time there"
4,"The perfect place to have an original Indian meal. It takes you to the middle of India!Der beste Ort, an dem man ein kleines Stück Indiens erleben kann! Wirklich indisch!"
2,"This is just another bar on the Reeperbahn that you'll never remember the name of after you stumble out in a drunken haze. The only reason I can remember is that I took a photo! On the weekends it's really busy, loads of mental dancing and drunkenness. On the weekdays they have EUR5 cocktails until midnight - not a bad deal."
4,Best quality Indian food around Hamburg.Love the way they received us...Kebabs and chef special fish fry is a must try..!Desserts & samosas are freshly made and tasty
3,"We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1:30. The restaurant was mostly empty except for one other table, but there are two small dining rooms, so it didn't feel too desolate.We ordered the lentil soup, the paneer pakoras, the mango curry with vegetarian meatballs, and the chicken biryani. The waiter was very patient with our German pronunciation of Hindu(?) words, and mostly ended up writing down the numbers of the dishes, so you can save yourself the trouble by just giving them the dish numbers.The food was quite good. We had some pappadams with a few tasty chutneys at the beginning (this is free/included). The lentil soup was really flavorful and had some fresh herbs on top that made it delicious. The mango curry was also quite good, with a very strong cardamom flavor (which my wife was into, but was a bit much for me), and served with a side of rice. The chicken biryani was a bit mixed for me. The chicken was boneless (I would have preferred the bones), but cooked to perfection. The rice included a tremendous amount of vegetables (zucchini, cauliflower, green beans, more than I've ever seen in a biryani), and was highly sauced, perhaps too much. It was a tremendous amount of food; easily twice as much as I could eat.The prices are higher than I would have expected (approx 5 euro for soup, 13 euro for curry, 15 euro for biryani), but it was a lot of food, and we ended up bringing some home. I'll come again sometime, but only when I'm really hungry."
4,"First time trying pakistan's food and i felt in love directly. The food to my sense is like indian's food, full of spicy but soooo delicious. The best thing is that there is a place where we can sit directly there, no need a chair. So cozy so relax, makes us almost felt to sleep :DThe food like i said total delicious, especially very recommended the mango lassi. That is like tasting heaven's drink, until after that we seemed hypnotized with the taste left behind on our mouth,"
4,"This is a great burger joint in Hamburg.  My favorite so far in the burger joints I've checked out in the eponymous city!The closest comparison I can draw is to London's Patty & Bun - Dulf's is a messy plate-full of beefy delights, customizable in many different ways and overflowing with goodness.  The restaurant sits in the Karolinenviertel, which is a millennial area with Notting Hill-like vibes and tons of recent grad-aged people.Dulf's Burger serves 150g patties of Charolais beef - if you have never seen this French breed of cattle, then google it - spoiler alert: they're huge.  Served atop your choice of three different buns: sour dough, sesame, or brioche, the burgers are sumptuous and the toppings are plentiful.I went for the Farmer burger on a brioche bun, which comes topped with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, a fried egg, homemade burger sauce, and overflowing with coleslaw. Dulf's range of homemade burger sauces is quite impressive too: highlights include truffle, wasabi or cumin sauce....Of course, I went for the truffle sauce.I wrote a bit more about it on my blog; beeffanatic.com/2016/11/…"
4,Loved this place. Was so cute inside and the tapas were awesome! Def coming back again maybe during the happy hour when the food is discounted. Can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommend.
4,"Ich liebe den Elbstrand, schon im Sommer grillen oder picknicken ist schon was schönes. Aber nicht nur im Sommer kann man am Strand spazieren gehen, im Herbst ist es auch ganz schön mit Schatz, ner Decke und nem heißen Kakoa =)"
3,"It's a vegan cafe in St Pauli. With plenty of seating outdoors for the warmer days, this is a nice cafe run by very friendly people. The menu is not huge but enough choices to satisfy most people's needs. They have a daily specials board and a few options for drinks. It was packed the whole time we were there and it's a relatively young crowd. I had the club sandwich special and my wife had the quiche of the day. Food tasted good but I wish there was a little less leaves and red cabbage in both meals. The cake I had for dessert was also very nice. If you are a vegetarian or vegan this is a nice option in town. Even if you are not it's worth a try :-) It's reasonable, simple and clean food. Everything is super fresh and staff are friendly."
4,great food. something a bit different. nice staff too.
4,"This museum was very fun. It smells very nice inside, although the spices out on display to smell have pretty much lost most of their smell / blended together with other spices. There were four samples that you could try (roasted chickpeas, sugared chickpeas, and two other sweet things). It was pretty cool walking around and seeing all the different spices."
4,"Although I cannot make myself endorse anything related to tobacco I must admit the charm, kind staff and excellent espresso drinks at D&D saved my morning for a week while visiting Hamburg. Never start smoking!  Just drink coffee and enjoy the atmosphere outside away from second hand smoking :)"
4,Wonderful service! Worth the wait! Even the Caesar salad was great! Thanks for introducing me to some Hamburg Gins!
0,Slooooooooow.Bad fries. Waited over 30 minutes for a draught beer and lemonade.Capacity (outside) approx 56. There were around 10-15 people.Now it's 35 minutes.
4,"Just wow! Extremely friendly and helpful staff, impressive food! Anytime! 100% recommendation!"
4,"Bester Burger Hamburgs! Leckere Brötchen, sehr gutes Fleisch! Wer medium bestellt, bekommt auch medium! Die Süßkartoffel-Pommes sind auch top und vor allem wird eine recht große Portion serviert.  Die Location hat echt Charme, individuell und modern eingerichet ohne steril oder snobby zu wirken. Die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich. Reservierungen sind nicht möglich, wir haben aber kaum 10min gewartet.  Burger essen in Hamburg? Dann zu Otto!"
4,"Batman hat den besten Dürüm der Stadt. Ich war schon in vielen Dönerläden, aber nirgends ist das Dürümbrot so gut gemacht wie dort. Für jeden weiter zu empfehlen. Der Preis von 3EUR ist auch an der unteren Grenze der Durchschnittsdönerpreise. Außerdem macht der Dürüm dort so richtig satt, also für Hungrige und Genussleute gleichermaßen eine Top- Adresse!"
3,"Yum! By word of mouth I ended up at Quán dò last night and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is small and stylish. Red walls and colorful lanterns turn up the fun factor here. We waited a few minutes to get a table inside and it was worth it. I got the bun with sesame pork and it was simple and savory. I like how Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg don't use msg so the food tastes fresher and cleaner. My bun was good! It came with cucumbers, carrots, peanuts, rice noodles, and grilled pork. My green tea came out scorching hot so I had to wait a while to drink it. Quán dò is good for people watching, grabbing a bite to eat before you hit the town, or just to have a casual night out with a buddy. I will definitely be back. CASH ONLY."
3,"Cute place for a brunch in summer.Outdoor seatings however arent the most comfortable. The crowd is made of families, groups of friends, couples, business meetings. The brunch buffet doesn't offer a very wide choice, however it has the basics: cheese, salami, bread, eggs, müsli .."
4,"This was a truly fantastic meal, possibly the best we have had on our trip in Germany.I got the filets of 3 fish in dijon sauce, and my partner ordered the schnitzel.  The fish was out of this world, some of the best I have ever had, and the sides it came with were amazing as well.  To drink I had the peppermint and ginger tea which they make themselves, and the waitress/owner offered refills of hot water for the tea, and brought tap water to drink (a rare pleasure for Canadians who are used to always having free tap water at restaurants).  The tea was really an unexpected bonus to the meal, as I was expecting dried tea, instead of fresh leaves and ginger.  Even the sugar to add to the tea was crystal rock sugar instead of plain ground white sugar.I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the fish or the local fare, however you should make a reservation or be prepared to sit outside / wait, as it is very popular!"
3,Cafe Mexico is a nice little Mexican restaurant just to the north of the Schanze. I had the chilli con carne burrito and was quite surprised when something that I would have recognised as enchiladas was presented to me. Definitely different to the Americanised burrito places that are starting to pop-up around Hamburg. If you like tequila then (I assume) this is definitely a place to visit seeing as they have about 100 different types A nice touch is the complementary shot of tequila before you leave.
4,"An amazingly beautiful building from inside and out. Make sure to do the tour of the inside, it is well worth it and only cost 4 Euros! You get a bit of history and get to see the amazing rooms. Everything is original which makes the building special in Hamburg. It survived both world wars almost completely (besides for the windows) intact."
4,"There is no other option than rating this spot with five starts due to it's perfect location. There is obviously no parking and it's best to come by public urban transport and walk the balance. There are some simple food offerings, but they have a good selection of beverages. I also like the approach that they serve a lot of local brands besides the big brands of the large conglomerates. This is a mandatory spot to visit for every Hamburg trip."
4,"Open till midnight, quick and cheap meal fix. Friendly store attendants and ample portions. I love how they smoosh and mix up your döner box before filling and layer the sauce every now and then, and not just plop things into a box that never mix."
3,"Monet, Renoir, Degas, Nardin, Valjoux, Rado, and Piaget!And if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that those last four are not French impressionists, they're Swiss watchmakers.Anyway, Kunsthalle is about as much fun as watching paint dry, as visiting this place basically amounts to three hours of watching dry paint. It's a very, very classic art museum. Mostly framed oil works, a little sculpture, a little modern art... not very stimulating to a layperson like me who just doesn't go for this stuff.So I'm not the best person to ask, but I think I can safely say this is a classic, non-interactive, super-quiet, admire-only, hands-off museum. Tickets are reasonably priced, they have student discounts, and all of the captions have English and German. Very Anglo/American friendly."
3,"Fabulous sushi! We could not sit outside as we arrived 5 people instead of the 4 we had booked for but there was no problem as during lunch hour there was plenty of space inside (apparently booking is a must for evenings). We were seated close to the kitchen/counter which was a little noisy. You can order a mixed platter to share or if you are picky and a vegetarian like me you can go for individual rolls. The 3 I ordered on recommendation were waaaay too much, go for two if you are real hungry and one for a snack! They have a veggie roll with tempura inside which adds a yummy crunch and extra taste, the other veggie roll I had was kind of bland in comparison. There are also other hot food options if you like neither sushi nor fish, and this is where they are losing one star for me as there's meat, there's fish, but there's nothing vegetarian (this, and the one ""boring"" roll I had). The restaurant has a nice atmosphere too and can seat larger groups so if you want to dine out with sushi lovers it's the perfect place."
0,"If you are Vietnamese and looking for good viet food, don't come here. Not only was the waitress rude but the food did not taste one bit Vietnamese. I asked the waitress if she spoke Vietnamese and she looked at me like I said something disrespectful. And when I asked for the check, she yelled at one of her employees to bring it to me in German. But hey, what do you expect by getting Vietnamese food in Germany.Zero stars"
4,"Best place to eat turkish food around Altona. Very good quality, reasonable prices, friendly and fast waiters. Daily lunch is 5 EUR. I just know this place during the day. If you park you car outside, pay the necessary fees, there are always policemen around!"
2,I thought this place was fine.  the view is certainly great.  The Pannfisch hamburger style was very nicely done.  but the sous vide salmon was not as successful - seemed odd in texture.  Overall the prices were pretty high so the 'value for money' didn't work for me.
3,"Just went to Kardelen with a bunch of people from the office. I was told that no-one had reviewed it because no-one could ever remember it's name. Well it wasn't even listed in Qype! As it happens I also forgot the name, but clever me took a photo ;) Anyway I had a chicken doner plate (it came with rice and salad and sauce). It cost EUR5.50 and also came with free bread and tea! It was pretty huge (see photos) but I was pretty hungry and so polished it off... I'd definitely go back again."
3,Been here twice and the fish was great. Very fresh. Great view of the River Elbe. Service was good and prices reasonable.
3,"If you are looking for good German fair at a reasonable price, then you can't go far wrong here. Nagel is a traditional German pub, where you can drink and be merry.The food comes quickly and tasty, remember it is traditional so cash is the only way to pay for anything here."
3,Old pharmacy transformed into a student pub. Like the vibe and comparatively low prices. Main drink is beer.
4,"Really cool vibe (I kind of want to live in here), friendly/attentive service, and excellent drinks and food. The waffles and poached egg with avocado on toast are standouts. To top it all off, the breakfast hours are very generous! My favorite coffee shop in Hamburg"
3,"Eating here could be classed as an adventure. Firstly, finding it, is rather awkward due to the huge amount of building work going on in the nearby hafencity and the fact it is hidden under a railway bridge. Then theres the quirky 15 degree interior, which looks and feels like you are sliding slowly into the Elbe canal. Added to all this, is the randomness of the seating arrangements, where you could be sitting next to anyone, (and your food could be sliding slowly down the table towards your new friends). However, these can all be considered plus sides as it is a completley unexpected, and quite wonderful experience. The food is excellent, the chef knowing pretty much all theres is to know about original German food, the atmosphere is very friendly (perhaps because its so small and cosy) the drinks are good (standard), and the cost is reasonable. If you fancy a bit of an adventure and are looking to experience something a little different, then this is definately the place. The only downside is that its best to go when its busy to get the true feeling of the place."
3,"Elegant Italian fine dining restaurant along the Hamburg riverfront. Parking is a short walk away. Delicious food plated gorgeously. Good white wine. Attentive, efficient service! Bravo!My whitefish was 2 generous filets with crispy skin. The accompanying vegetables and mashed potatoes were also yummy. My friend has a large portion of steak which he enjoyed tremendously."
3,"On our first night in Hamburg, our buddies took us to this bar. It was a pretty cool bar. Everyone was friendly, including the staff. We were there for someones birthday party. We chopped it up with Hamburg locals and some folks that were from out of town. Lots of cute ladies. It was a typical bar with the dim lights and music playing in the background to set the mood. I liked the bar except that they allowed smoking, but hey, it is what it is."
1,"Ok pasta/ pizza to a ok price and friendly staff. That's what you get, if you get in. Usually long que and even if you book a table you have to wait an hour or more to get in."
1,"A big Bavarian style bar with litre masses of beer, staff in Bavarian costume. the food is quite good and the place is fun with a group of people. The staff could be more friendly."
4,"This neighborhood has its own soul. Its dark red brick buildings  follow  the canals where many footbridges allow you to travel through these buildings. One tip is to go during the sunrise or sunset, you won't regret it!"
4,I came here as a guest at a group party with a fixed menu. So I can comment on the regular menu. We were a party of 30. The service and food were excellent. As an american I have a discriminating taste for good beef. Frankly my opinion of burgers and steaks here on the continent hasn't been good. I rarely order them because I have been disappointed so many times. But I had a wonderful steak here. Char grilled and obviously a very nice piece of beef to begin with. Juicy and properly cooked medium rare. The sides served family style were hot and a nice variety. The assorted desert plate was a nice surprise as well. Prompt service with plenty of attentive staff.
4,"It is delicious,,,not so expensive and absolutely clean...Best Asia Imbiss in Hamburg..."
2,"Food is okay, but everything is on the pricey side. Very interesting spot for a cosy italian restaurant. Always very busy amd very hard to get them on the phone in order to book a table. Best to just show up there and maybe wait 10mins for a table to open up. Despite it being hectic, the personnel do try their best and keep smiling."
2,"The sitting-on-the-floor option is a novelty thing and fun - for the first five minutes. afterwards you get a bit cramped. there's hardly any space and if you go with more than 4 people, conversation tends to get lost in curry fumes. Yet my friends never seem to get tired of it and always drag me into this place.The food is ok. Even though the menu offers plenty of dishes they tend to taste similar. Some of the dishes are served quite cold so ask if you're unsure. Also stay away from the lassis unless you like sweets with your main course.the service is a bit grumpy and not very talkative. still, it's ok+ food at an ok price at a great location!"
4,"This is my go-to in Hamburg! The ""sofa bar"" (I don't think I've ever actually called it Zoë) is a great place to catch up with friends or get a drink before heading out. The music isn't too loud, I've always been able to find a seat, the prices are reasonable, and I love the atmosphere: vintage couches that are comfy and clean, cool lighting, and just the overall vibe of people chatting and enjoying themselves around you.The one downside are the bathrooms. I've never really understood the no-toilet-seat-in-the-women's-bathroom thing, but it's also not uncommon in Germany, so I won't let that affect my rating :)"
3,"A really great falafel place that has cosy seating area and nice food. It's downstairs, really roomy, and free newspapers give you a reason to stay for a bit longer and make more of a meal of your falafel rather than wolfing it down and bailing again straight away. I guess at a pinch the falafel at Falafelstern tasted a smidge better but overall given the ambiance here, and the similar pricing, it is an all-round better package. The falafal certainly was large for the price of E3,50 and the service was friendly. If you are in Hamburg longer then go here and Falafelstern and you will be happy!"
2,"Probably over priced, for what you get, but I guess that's how they make money. We did the all you can eat dinner. It's not like typical all you can eat buffet places. You order off of an Ipad. You can order up to 10 items (for the both of us) every 10 minutes for 10 rounds. They have both sushi and ""hot plates."" The portions are small, but there were tasty options. The edamame was served cold though. Like, just taken out of the refrigerator, cold, not even room temperature. Maybe that's normal in Germany or for this place, but I found it displeasing. The sushi rolls you order come with 2 pieces (so 2 pieces is 1 item out of your 10). The salmon nigiri was very good. There were large slices of salmon over the rice, and it tasted very fresh. The sushi rolls were good as well. But keep in mind for every piece you do not eat, they will charge you extra. By the end we were forcing ourselves to finish a few sushi rolls so we didn't have to pay extra for them.  Drinks are not included, so don't be surprised at the end if your bill is slightly higher than you would pay at any other sushi restaurant. For two people, we ended up paying about 65 Euros for our dinner. We definitely wouldn't spend that much if we went to any other sushi restaurant and ordered individual rolls, however, we also wouldn't have been able to try so many different things. So if you're on a budget, maybe skip this place. The sushi took a long time to arrive. If we ordered sushi in round 2, it would arrive at the same time if not after we had ordered hot dishes in round 3. It also took a long time to find our waiter so we could pay. When one of the servers came and picked up our empty plates, we told him we were ready to pay and he said he would tell his colleague. It took another 10 or so minutes before we even saw our waiter so we could ask to pay again. I took away 2 stars for the slow service and slow food delivery, and the high price."
0,"Barca is a shame for the leisure and tourism industry in Hamburg!On a sunny day in September we decided to take a pedalo boat trip in the evening and called Barca. Unfortunately they only have one mobile phone and no one picks up the phone. I tried it several times during 3 hours and I wrote an email. We needed to go to Barca without any information as the website does not provide a lot of general info on the pedalos. This left us unsatisfied at the counter at 7 p.m., because a boat rental was not possible anymore. They told us it is to late as sunset is in an hour and they frankly speaking do never pick up the phone. The pedalos looked nice and the landing stage was packed with people chatting and enjoying the fresh breeze.In the end this is the worst customer service I have expected in years. No one ever picked up the phone, nobody responded to my mail so far and the website does not provide basic information on the rental times."
4,"Delicious food, generous portions, friendly staff in cool atmosphere. What's not to like? Can't wait to go there again."
3,"I wasn't expecting to eat Portuguese in Germany, but when in Hamburg... Delicious Aioli. Chorizo had a wonderful smoked paprika bent to it. The gambas in garlic and olive oil was exactly how it sounds with the garlic having nice roasted notes. The good news is that it all goes down well with a local draft, or a glass of red. The atmosphere was charming and felt like a hectic, but warm family restaurant."
2,"Here is a steakhouse that looks great, has outstanding servers and a friendly happy vibe. But the food tastes pushed... The premium T bone was a delicious steak that was really tender. And, it was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request. The issue? 4! Count them--four 6 inch sprigs of fresh Rosemary on the hot plate under the steak overwhelming it with herby fumes! 1 would have sufficed! Four is enough to offend and halt an angry Water Buffalo at full waddle.Then the green beans were cooked squishy and had heavy butter. What happened to steaming so there is still a firm bite? And the steak sauce was an odd concoction of tomato cocktail sauce with onions??? For my premium steak? A horseradish Mayo with steak drippings would have been more interesting for a house steak sauce...The fries? Perfect.The 500g T bone (porterhouse actually with giant filet lobe) was a generous portion.The server crew oozed warm hospitality--bravo. The kitchen crew looked depressed. Maybe they knew that I would not enjoy my steak"
3,"I was walking around without my German friend so I had no translator. This place seemed fairly ""Americanized"" so I decided to go in in the hopes that someone here spoke English. I sat at the bar and luckily I was able to speak English to the bartender. He was nice by German standards haha. What I ordered: I got the veggie burger (Tina turner burger) and a beer. The burger was huge! And so tasty! The sauce was mayo-based (I think it was a currywurst sauce, but I'm not sure), but I enjoyed the flavor on this burger. The side was a small salad. Overall, it is not a standout place, but the quality of the food and service was good!"
4,Lovely little spot with excellent food. The lady there was very nice and she had an English menu which was a big help. Portions are large - we had the 3 course special and it was too much - we could have split one and it would have been plenty of food. Everything was fresh and tasty. Vegan & vegetarian options. PS - they are cash only.
4,"I have a fairly high bar for a food establishment to get a 5-star rating. I don't eat out a ton but, when I do, it's with the expectation of having an experience that I couldn't easily replicate at home (for half the cost and no travel time).We went to TrüffelSchwein to celebrate Valentine's Day. Even though it fell on a Sunday (when they're normally closed), they opened up for the special day and had a custom menu going. The dishes were mostly pulled from their regular menus with some customizations here and there. Still, points for opening on Sunday and printing a themed menu.Ambience: perfect. The dining room is intimate but gives each table enough room to have its own conversation. They have an outdoor space, but it was (1) February in Hamburg and (2) pouring rain. I'm sure it's amazing in the summer, though. The decor is relaxed upscale, not that I'm-rich-look-at-me feel that you'll find in most other Michelin-rated restaurants in Hamburg. It's classy yet comfortable, a nice-jeans-and-blazer vibe. For the occasion, they had rose petals on the tables, a perfectly elegant touch.Service: nailed it. That alone earns them their Michelin star for me. Their timing and delivery are impeccable. They're there to top off your water or wine seconds before you realize you need a refill. The courses are perfectly spaced out and presented. They give you space to enjoy your dining experience but magically show up moments before you even notice you need something. When our waitress heard us speaking English (and clearly butchering any German we spoke with her), she smoothly switched over to English without any hesitation. When we continued in German ('cause we're stubborn fools), she switched back again without missing a beat. Top notch professionalism, folks.Food: everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and superbly plated. We went for the 4-course menu paired with gin martinis and a white wine, which was just the perfect amount. That menu includes a bread basket with truffle butter and tapenade and two amuse-bouches.When it comes to higher-end restaurants, TrüffelSchwein is absolutely worth the splurge, more so than the 185€ you'd have to shell out at Haerlin just for food in my book. I look forward to returning to TrüffelSchwein in the future."
4,"Charming space. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Warm and welcoming. Efficient service. Fantastic seafood. Great drinks. Reasonably priced. Classy, but not at all stuffy. The Labskaus was excellent. It's kind of like a seafood tartare. Lovely. Excellent soups and sauces. Highly recommended. Would definitely return."
4,Awesome German fish restaurant (try Hamburger Krebssuppe) in old town Hamburg
4,"Dig polish food? And vodka? Look no further - the place is not huge, but the food is! To make sure you enjoy a meal there, make a reservation - this place is always packed and for a reason.Friendly and focused staff and you can see the chef in the tiny kitchen.When in Hamburg, make sure to have dinner here."
3,"IMHO so far the best Portugese Restaurants in Hamburg I have tried! The only drawback is that it is way too crowded and therefore the waiters tend to be stressed out. Make a reservation! The food is definitely worth it! Nice ambiance too! Don't spread the word, its toocrowded already ;-) Ok others are obviously not on the same page with me here, but try the Cataplanas (copper bowlswith simmered seafood) You didn' t like it here? Good. More space for the rest of us."
1,"Limited menu (5 main course besides burgers) but at least they had an English version! Ordered the burrata, which at 18.5€ was pricey but that's because it is about three times normal size. Sadly, it lacked flavor and didn't have the soft, buttery consistency I was hoping for. Also ordered a burger with melted onions. Came so full of creamy sauce it was dripping. Had to scrape a ton of extra mayo sauce off to be edible. Tasted ok, but not worth the trouble. Also, don't say yes when they all you if you want one dish before another... They won't put in the order for your second until your first is gone (even if it's a huge barrata big enough for 4 people). Sat awkwardly waiting for my burger for over half an hour before she asked if I finally wanted it... Uhgg. This place was meh, and I wouldn't return."
2,"A pretty standard Indian place. It's nothing extraordinary but is part of the Schanze scene and like most places has seating outside on the sidewalk. I found service to be quite disinterested and not fast which started annoying us after a while. Food on the other hand was good and the two times I've eaten there, it was good. Unfortunately I find that the portions are quite small and they skimp on meat if you order it. If you're just looking to sit outside and have a couple beers, this place is fine. If you want great Indian food, there's other places that are better."
3,"""Create you own salad"" places are really hard to find in Europe and look no further people because this is one of them! So excited to be able to build my own salad. You pick a base four toppings and a protein. The salads come with a slice of bread and I found the small salad to be quite filling. The mint tougher dressing was really tasty and refreshing so I definitely recommend it. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating and not very crowded for lunch!"
4,"Such an amazing place. We had the tuna steak with green peppercorn sauce and the assorted fish assortment in white wine & tomato sauce off of the specialty menu. Everything was absolutely sublime, and they helpfully brought more bread to help soak up the left over sauces. The potatoes that came with the tuna were also unusually good, as though rosemary went into them before they were fried. A fairly unforgettable experience for these weary travelers."
4,"Great restaurant! A nice place, a lovely atmosphere and a fast and friendly service. The meal were excellents, the meet soft and tasty, the side dish good but perhaps a little bit too simple, and the price was fully justified (we were even expecting to pay more). I only can recommend this place for people who are looking for a little more sophisticated dinner."
4,"This is so far the best place to eat in Hamburg. Great location. Excellent food. Really the best. Loved herrings, all different kinds of potato dishes. Beer and Schnitzel also. Cute decors."
4,When did you last sit on a stove while conversing with someone on a washing machine? Exactly.
3,"Riad's is a nice little restaurant. It's a little bit dark in here if you don't get a seat in the front room, but pretty comfortable nevertheless. I had a delicious Falafel plate for 5,50EUR from the lunch menu card. For 7,50EUR you can also get a lunch menu consisting of any main course, three starters and a desert. This is what I'm going to try next time, since I still was a little hungry after having had my Falafel plate."
3,"Delicious burritos! Oh my goodness so good!As a Californian it is extremely difficult to find decent (let alone authentic) Mexican food in Germany but this place did it. I mean, who knew you could find nopales in Germany? Extra nice touch with the small religious shrine behind the counter and Mexican wrestler wall paper, it was like stepping into a burrito shop in San Diego.The beans, the rice, the pico de gallo, perfect.Not giving the full 5 stars because it is a small space where people tend to linger long past the end of their meal making finding a seat (or waiting for one) a hassle. Much, much better than Dolores in Berlin. Still, I'd come back here ASAP!"
4,"Wonderful meal. Incredible service. Charming ambiance even the clientele looked hand picked for this place. Family nights out, fancy dinner dates, groups of friends catching up over a long French dinner. All represented tonight. I had the snails to start. (They are not in shells. They come in a hot pot pre stewed) it's was wonderful if a tad salty. Scampi provencal for the main was perfect. I wiped the sauce with extra bread. And the standout of the evening for me, the desert (who would have thought it, not I) the apple pancake soaked in a very lightly sweet liquor and Caramelized sugar on top. Not sure what wine I was served but it was great too."
2,"Value for money: far to expensiveService: needs training, to pushyLocation: interestingFood: good to averageBeen there a few more times invited on business expenses, the concept is interesting so is the location, but thats where the good news ends. Food quality and preparation varies and for my taste it's a notch above average. I used to live for several years in Japan and in California and comparing H&H to the benchmark the verdict is a simple one. How to improve: we all know money is made with beverages: Train your staff to stop being pushy. I am the guest and I will let you know if and when I want a new bottle of whatever. Train your staff on products you offer and of course on  the daily menue. To stay polite I will not post the answers I received on simple questions. Yes you have a nice winelist but where is some ""exquisit"" sake to go with ...? Lastly: attitude ... You want to play in the major league? Well you certainly have the right foundation, but there there is plentiful to improve if you really want to get there. Treat EVERY guest with respect not only your so called whatever VIPs. H&H has a good name in Hamburg I was told, but a name I can not eat, smell or drink for that matter. You guys can do far better. At present it is only 3/5 stars with the third one for the potential. Will be there again in late May. Hopefully we can see some kind of improvement."
3,"There is some construction going on at the street end and so it is not very easy to locate the cafe. Cafe has a very nice seating arrangement - nothing too overwhelming and you get enough space for yourself.. both inside and outside. Prices are not superhigh - though the coffee I ordered wasn't the best I had in a while. But, nice friendly staff and you really feel that you have come to a small home driven cafe in a positive sense. Very close to the station - so you dont need to walka lot..."
4,"I am always a little nervous about engaging with vegetarian food, but this has definitely altered my perspective. Delicious falafel dishes and good beer options make this the perfect place to settle into for an early evening meal. The food came really quickly, was well priced and the atmosphere in here is very relaxed. Although I haven't yet sampled the pleasures of the takeaway, I was glad to see they do this. Living locally, I will definitely be taking advantage of the takeaway dishes on offer."
4,"Can't believe I've never reviewed Olivio! A firm lunch favourite of mine (check today's pizza monza which is sat inside of me right now), this is perhaps the friendliest restaurant in Hamburg, nay, the world! A hilarious husband and wife team had us writing down our order on a piece of paper and delivering it to the kitchen today! If you go on a Friday lunchtime you often get free wine refills, not that I drink at lunch of course... Brilliant."
0,"Can't comment on quality of food , since we couldn't get paid the rude and unreasonable hostess who for whatever reason requested level of documents as if we crossing country borders. Vaccine proof, USA identification and a picture of passport apparently is not enough to dine in this establishment. She also requested our home address and original passport. And proceeded to lie in our face that no restaurant in Germany would accept us without original passport. We easily got in at a pub on next block."
4,A museum totally dedicated to chocolate! The guided tour was excellent and we sampled lots of chocolate along the way. Definitely recommend visiting when in Hamburg.
0,"Tried 4 rolls, all turned out to be deepfried and tasted all the same, like ranchid old fat. Can't believe the positive reviews here."
3,"Pretty much all bars on Hamburger Berg are the same, and Roschinsky's is no exception to that! Packed to the rafters every Thursday till Sunday, lots of drunks, students, and sweating people jumping up and down. Good stuff."
3,"Starbucks is usually good. I've been to this one several times already and I like it, but I have a few remarks.The last time the guy didn't prepare what I ordered. It was a quite night, so there is no excuse. I preferred not to tell him about his mistake and just took the drink.Often there are no tissues or soap in the toilet. W.t.f., Starbucks in the heart of Hamburg!And something positive: I recommend the 1st floor seats by the window. There is a nice view, better than the one on the 2nd floor."
3,"It seems kinda weird that I'm writing the first (English) review of the main Hamburg beach. But I guess there's not all that much to say: It's a sandy beach on the banks of the Elbe in Hamburg. A few notes:- A nice way to get here is to take the ferry from Landungsbrucken.- Be careful when you're near the water's edge. See that container ship going past in the distance? It moves a lot of water, and can cause some surprising waves- There are permanent barbeques on the beach.- There are public toilets- There are restaurants nearby"
4,A great place for fish and seafood. Always something good on the menu with regular specials. Reasonably priced and friendly staff too.
3,"Authentic, yummy Vietnamese cuisine, good quality meat, no use of glutamate. Ambiance could be a little cozier though and it was a little chilly inside."
4,"Your home away from home! No need to bring anything they've got it all here... your Kitchen, Laundry, Lounge, Dining, Bedroom (Including a comfy bed with duvet to snuggle up with.) and last but not least the games room at the back with a football table. Why have house parties in your own flat when you can use this place??No cleaning-up, the beers cheap and after a few drinks it really does feel like the place belongs to you and your mates. Brillent!"
3,I've been dying to go back ever since I tried Kuchnia. Such a cozy atmosphere with a great selection of cocktails and wine and the pierogis were all so delicious.
2,Convenient and easy but the döner meat isn't the best... there are better places in town. The service is okay. The other snacks are okay. The seating is. Good.
0,"I decided to check this place out because it was featured on Lonely Planet's ""Top Picks"" for Hamburg.  I relied heavily on their recommendations throughout my time in Germany, and they did not disappoint with the exception of Oberhafen Kantine.  We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday which you think would be the beginning on the Saturday night dinner crowd.  We walked inside and there were maybe 2 tables of diners and the other tables were marked reserved.  The staff was very rude and told us we could not take any of those tables.  I asked about the outdoor seating, which was completely empty, but I don't think they understood what I was asking.  We sat outside for a moment while we tried to come up with a new dining plan.  A minute later the hostess walks out and writes on the chalkboard that the patio was closed, in a clear attempt to get rid of us.  Maybe this place is more receptive to locals, but my experience as a tourist made me feel completely unwelcome.  If you're an English speaking tourist in Hamburg, I would avoid this place entirely."
3,"Very cute Scandinavian coffee shop, restaurant and novelty store :) When you first enter, it is decorated with of course the sweet wooden red horses that I own at home which I bought in Stockholm.  The colors are also very Scandinavian to me, with pastels, lights and brights. To the right is a boutique that sells Scandy candies, treats and miscellaneous gifts or decorations.  Once can stop in for a Fika which means coffee in Swedish or even have a nice meal.  They usually have Köttbullar, but since most dishes are made fresh in the back in a limited quantity, you have to check with the waitress to see what is on the menu that day. When I came in here, I ended up ordering some Tagliatelle with mushrooms and a truffle sauce which was very filling! I had wanted to of course try a more Swedish dish or even the classic Köttbullar (Swedish Meatballs) but to my dismay, they were fresh out of meatballs that day.Hamburg is actually heavily influenced by Scandinavian culture being so far north and in their history, the Danes and Swedes settled in areas around here such as Altona for example, particularly because the Hanseatic League had some battles over shipping merchant ships and even a history with Pirates.....and Vikings! I had to learn about this history when I did an Elbe/Altona tour :)Come here for breakfast, lunch or dinner they have cute names for their breakfast menu with Scandinavian themes like: the Oslo, the Stockholm, the Kopenhagen, and even you can order the Aarus. They also have wifi here!"
2,"A rock bar right out of St.Pauli station in Hamburg.On our way to start a long night out we decided to have our first beer in here - this is kind of a weird bar.. Why? Because the atmosphere is good, but something is still not working.The bar is rather narrow, when we were there it was pretty full but we were lucky to get a table.Anyhow, seems like it's a 30+ bar, maybe even 40+, I felt like I don't belong. There was a band playing live music which was pretty cool, but when they were on a break the music became weird, I wouldn't expect some of the songs they played (Phil Collins at a rock bar? Really?!)The menu is pretty awesome, I wasn't hungry and it still made me curious, lots of offers - from chili con carne and small appetizers to sandwiches and burgers. They also sell my favorite drink at the moment - açai energy drink, yum yumIt wouldn't be my first choice when going out, but it was ok."
4,"Kardelen must be doing something right to have a line out the door at lunch every day of the week. And I think it's a great place for casual Turkish food, too, but I have to admit that I'm a little puzzled about why it's so popular. The menu is incredibly long. This is mostly because they serve a handful of foods (Döner meat, falafel, veggies, various casseroles) in various formats (plates, wraps, sandwiches), and every single permutation is on the menu.The food itself is really good, and everything is prepared at the moment you order it, so you can customize as you like with sauces and other special requests. I usually get a Döner in bread or in a wrap (durum), but the other dishes look great, too. As mentioned, there is always a huge line. However, they are good at moving orders quickly, and even getting a seat in the packed dining room isn't all that hard. I do wish they were less popular and had more space/capacity, but that's just part of the Kardelen experience."
3,"I was coming here quite regularly 3-4 years ago but gave up because only one big problem and that is the glutomat chemical which they put in almost everything to improve the taste. I came again to see whether something changed but I'm afraid not much. It's really pity because the place is really good, and most of food and specially dim sums are delicious. Staff should be more polite but this is usual problem when place is very busy, they dont have time for nicer approach. I wasn't sure wether to give 3 or 4 stars because glutomat is serious problem but in the end I gave the streched 4 star because delicious stem breads just landed on my table :-)"
3,"Good burger, nice restaurant, self-service, price low"
3,"The Stadtpark is a great place to relax and lie in the sun, have a walk, go running or make barbecue. There is a special area for the barbecue with containers for the charcoal. Highlights of the Stadtpark are the Planetarium and the pool."
4,Sehr coole Location !!
3,"Whether or not 20up is your kind of scene it's worth it to come and check out the view at least once while you're in Hamburg. Floor to ceiling windows give a breathtaking view of the Hamburg harbor. When we came it was really crowded and we had to hover to get a table, but once we sat down it was really nice. The drinks here are strong and pricey, about 9-16 euros per drink.  The dress code is business casual and the crowd is a bit more on the mature side. I would put this on the beginning of your itinerary to grab a drink and tick off your list, then walk over to the bars to fill up the rest of your drinking tank. :)"
1,"It is what it is. It's an easy spot, but the food isn't stellar. It's affordable but tastes like so so delivery food."
2,"I've never been to this style of restaurant before and found it rather amusing. Whilst the food wasnt exactly 5 star, there is plenty of it and the quality was good. I was in a group of 4 and we found the service to be quick, polite and attentive. Whilst the visit was on a Tuesday evening (not exactly prime time) the atmosphere was good. If you love ample portions and no frills dining I'd recommend this restaurant."
0,Walked in with 2 friends and was seated in a good seat by the window.  3 minutes later another waiter came up and demanded we move to another table same size but in the back by the busy kitchen and bathroom stairs.  He was rude about it and could have just taken one of the chairs we had if he needed it for other people.  Who cares about the food when the atmosphere starts with a rude slap in the face.
4,"Great food, great place, near the city centre and with a subway station right under it. The room it's huge, with high ceilings and full of chandeliers with low light, creating an intimate (but not boringly romantic) and cool environment. Really friendly staff, and surprisingly relaxed environment. One of the best Italian restaurants I've ever went to! I started with a duck carpaccio (It wasn't raw, so It was tasty!) Tried a spicy Sicilian sausage pasta (I want more!). Finished with a huge Tiramisu (but it was average, although my eyes - and everybody's eyes in the room - were really happy with it's size). There was some kind of wave when they saw my Tiramisu coming. Or maybe it was just the great Sicilian (30EUR/bottle) wine. :)I totally recommend it! High price (45EUR/person with wine), but its worth the effort!"
0,"Ok, before I start this review I have to say that the food is actually good and authentic. However, that is the only positive thing about this place. Let's talk about the food first.We ordered the pork udon and that was pretty tasty, even better than some of the udon places in California. The pork was flavorful and so was the broth. The agedashi tofu I got tasted good as well, but the portions were so tiny we literally got a cube of tofu per person. Next, my beef bowl was good too! The meat was tender and flavorful.Sigh. The restaurant itself looked so worn down. The chairs were uncomfortable, the walls were bare, and everything just looked like no one cared about it. Our server was the absolute worst part of the entire night. She was slow and when we asked what was in the twenty-five euro bento box she said ""I have no idea! What do you mean?""Then we asked her politely if she could find out what was in it, and she said, ""what?"" By this point I was already so annoyed. When she came back she really put the cherry on top of the sundae was telling us ""the bento box comes with salad, a miso soup, and rice of course!"" The she gave us a bad attitude when we decided not to order it. Even worse, she hardly came to check up on us, and when I asked her for the check she looked confused again. It was just a miserable dining experience. The prices were very expensive as well. The menu didn't explain exactly what you got, and it was again so old and dirty. For the food alone, this place would have gotten four stars (even with the expensive prices,) but the service was so terrible that I could almost safely say that this was one of the worst nights of my life."
4,"Don't really understand the bad reviews, cause I  really liked this bar! They play really good music and have an underground disco section. If you don't want wait behind the crowd to get your drinks by the main bar, you can go underground to get your drinks there as it was way less busy.Prices are decent and staff is friendly.  If I visited Hamburg again I'd probably return!"
2,Despite its location it is actually a decent bar with pretty good food and cocktails. Opens 24 hours at weekends during summer.
3,"After a long afternoon of shopping/windown shopping in what is probably our favorite street in Hamburg we decided to rest our shoppign weary feet and grab a coffee. This place although large with four different seating areas it's still hard to find a place to sit. the place looked good though so we thought it was worth the 5-10 minute wait for a good seat. The lattes were decent, the cake moist, menu is well priced and atmosphere is chilled out and relaxed. A perfect place for brunch with friends or just afternoon coffee and cake. Good service too although you have to order and pay at the bar."
4,"This had to be one of the highlights of our trip. Take your time to look for all of the minute details! You'll not believe what you will see...a whole miniature world of people working, playing, beautiful scenic sights, city light...so much to see, the three hours we spent there allowed to really enjoy the work that's gone into the entire display!"
4,"Do not let the cheap prices misguide you. You'll be getting premium stakes here !!!I ordere rib-eye 300 he and my god what a beauty. The searing and crust was great, the seasoning was really good and the meat had a nice marbleIng too. The side dishes were also nice but honestly I was here for a good steak and I got one."
2,"I was quite curious after all these great reviews!Unfortunately, underwhelmed by it myself.Let's start with the good: the servers are fun, the fish is fresh and cooked well, the location is 'typical Portuguese quarter' (but note that this means a view of parked cars and being surrounded by smoking people when seated outside).But the cooking was hit and miss; e.g. Tuna with a mint pesto - excellent, fruit sauce with white fish - awkward combination, steaks - completely overcooked; the order medium rare - get medium well kind of off the mark. The house wines we were recommended were not good at all, the white still being the best of the three. The red wine was served outright warm...Be prepared that the 4-course meal, 50€ plus drinks, will be very filling; they definitely don't skimp on portion sizes here."
4,"What a gem this place is.  I walked a solid 2 miles from the S-Bahn to get here, as it's nestled in a Hamburg neighborhood.  It's not a tourist spot.  It was worth the walk.Landhaus Scherrer is an interesting combination of first class and family in its decor and service. The single waiter than handled my room was a gentleman - thoughtful, professional, and capable of a laugh at the sight of a child (a family was dining that night).  The greeting woman seemed quite similar - a bit serious at first, but clearly very kind if you needed help.So the atmosphere was excellent, but the food actually topped it.  This is no neighborhood comfort food.  After picking out an incredibly inexpensive (but good) wine for me, the waiter brought out a complementary plate of variations on a pumpkin theme - ice cream, custard, pumpkin slices, etc, all prepared differently and all wonderful.  After a salad came the crusted duck dish. It was one of the best duck dishes I've ever had - full of flavor and wonderfully prepared.  I also had an excellent desert, but I can't recall it any longer.In sum, Landhaus Scherrer is a real find for a visitor of Hamburg.  I hope it's well-known by the locals.  Regardless, all who visit or live in Hamburg should stop in."
3,"I really like the Irish Rover. It always makes me feel at home, being a traditional Irish set up, complete with live music on Sunday's as well. They recently introduced a lunch menu! It's a bit sparse so I've only ordered the fish and chips during the two times that I've been in since this addition. It's a huge plate. Definitely the largest piece of fish I've ever gotten in a fish and chips meal and tons of fries.During the evening, they have a feta dip on their menu that is outta this world good. I always ask for no olives and they're happy to do so.On the weekends, they have a full Irish breakfast available for brunch. So yummy and kid friendly. They have a high chair! I've been bringing the wee one with me since he was about 5 mo old, both for brunch and for dinner. I guess you're not truly Irish unless you've brought the babe to a bar.The cooking is great, the beer is delicious, the people are friendly and those will all have me coming back again :-)"
4,Best museum I have been to! Super cool and such an accurate architectural design. I loved the airport and runway design as I just love flights! Everyone will definitely love this. Worth every penny
3,"My girlfriend is a chocolate lover, so when she visited Hamburg we knew we had to visit this museum.As with anything, it is all about expectations. We come from Costa Rica, a cocoa-producing country, so we knew that maybe our minds were not going to be exploted with new exciting information, but we wanted to have a different view of how chocolate is percieved in other countries, and of course.. eat some chocolate! And that we did!Regarding the language, we got there on a Sunday afternoon, and there were no more English tours available, so we had to go with the German one (I'm learining some, so took it as a challenge). We were offered a written guide in English for EUR 2.5 deposit which covers most of what the guide says. The tour consists of a combination of talks from the guide, hands on chocolate making, and lots of tastings of the cocoa seeds, and chocolate in all of its various stages of production. They guide was very friendly and knowledgeable, and even stayed with us for a while at the end explaning anything in English what we didn't understand. The gift shop is amazing (if you are a chocolate lover) with everything chocolate: choco pasta, choco pesto, choco beers.. you name it. Overall, a great activity for a rainy Sunday afternoon in Hamburg. We definitely recommend it to any chocolate fan."
4,"Delicious Ramen and good service! It was quite full that day - there was a little queue outside, so I recommend coming there early."
4,Authentic Indian food! Especially the naan! The portion size was also perfect. Only thing that was a bit irritating was the limited sitting space.
4,Very friendly staff and great breakfast. It was also fun to learn about the many different brewing methods and to try something new.
1,"We tried seven different dim sum dishes but not only half of it was tasty and authentic. Some fried dumplings smelt already of (pork) fat when being served and didn't taste good either. Since we are regular in Hong Kong and Singapore, we know how it should taste. In addition, we were not amazed about the service either (actually fairly unfriendly, that's why I deduced another star).Nevertheless, we are 10.000km away from Hong Kong and authentic Chinese food is difficult to get: try the chicken feed at the Dim Sum house  they are really good and tasty!"
4,"After having eaten at Thai Cowboys in the Sternschanze area of Hamburg, I decided to try out this one and see if it was up to the same high standard. The staff were friendly, and when they could see that I couldn't find what I wanted on the menu board, I was asked what I was looking for. When I told them I wanted something with squid, I was told that they didn't do anything with squid, but if I really wanted it, they would be happy to fulfil my wish. The result was absolutely delicious, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending you try this. It's an ""imbiss"" rather than a restaurant, so don't be expecting silver service. If all you want is top-notch Thai at a ""gunstig"" price, then you've found the place."
4,"Have been to this place a handful of times now and the experience never gets old. It's one of those you have to be appreciative of where you are type deal. Literally if you blink you will miss this place bc it's so small but the intimacy will never fade. Hands down some of THE best drinks I've had my entire stay in Germany. Service is impeccable and they also have a coat check. Hope that smoking is not an issue because they smoke indoors with the windows closed. This place is great to let your hair down without having to do the club two step of prepping, dressing up, meeting a guy/girl. You can just come here in regular clothes, grab a drink and make a new friend since you will more than likely be bumping into people even though you may not have been planning to."
4,"Beautiful French restaurant serving fantastic seafood food. Amazing deserts, carefully selected wine and Bouillabaisse à la Marseille will make you come back! Not many dishes on the menu, but along with fish and seafood you'll see one regional (Northern Germany) speciality which brings an intersting twist. Simply but tastefully furnished. Very polite and attentive service.  And what I found pretty amazing, families with kids are welcome. So if you're put off by snobby French restaurants in Hamburg, try Marseille!"
4,"Good atmosphere, great breakfast.We took 1 large breakfast which was indeed large with mix of breads, yogurt, hard cheese, fruits and salad. In addition, we also took eggs and salad which was good but nothing out of the ordinary.Lovely opener for the day."
3,"The food of Tatı was good. Just some pity thinks are,  that they making the crepes with Emmentaler. Normally use should be e.g. Morbie. Second is that I couldn't enjoy my crepes so much. It wasn't like a normal Bretagne crepes all in one. On my crepes all ingredients was separate,  that made it hard to eat. The quiche was really good."
2,"Definitely not my cup of tea. Thankfully I've only been once. It's actually a couple years back and it ended up being the most expensive meal I've ever paid for (seriously!) I had invited an ex and her folks out to dinner. They had taken us out many times hence it was payback time. Unfortunately they were big eater and drinkers. A multi-course meal and many bottles (expensive as all hell) later we left this place, my wallet empty. Thankfully the food is ok and definitely of higher quality. The wine selection was also good. Yet, would I go back? No! I particularly dislike the decor and places like this in general. The majority of people eating here are not my crowd. It's fineplaces like this are made for those people. And one star is added to this review for providing such a place for them. That keeps 'em away from my favorite places. If you like typical Hamburg flair, with a real feeling of lots of Hanseatic upper class around you, this is your mecca. You can't go wrong with the food as it is a well run establishment. You probably won't be going here if you can't afford it so prices won't discourage you. The location is also quite nice I have to admit. I nice old house.perfect if you live nearby on the Elbchaussee and there's parking in the back..bring your Bentley's if you got 'em! If you're young, modern, cosmopolitan or anything but Hanseatic blue-blood, you'll feel better elsewhere."
3,Greek food for the soul ;)im not Greek but i really liked the food and appetizer here.the owner is supper friendly and gave us very good tips on selecting different dishes. :)
3,"I really enjoyed this, geeky as it may be. There's zero hype, and not much education happening. Basically, you're walking on your own through a good portion of a real submarine, free to poke and prod. If that appeals to you, have at it! But take it from me, watch your head. The doors are low at the top, and high at the bottom, and generally have pipes just where you want to stand up after passing through. (Probably not a good outing for a first date.)"
3,"Had a great dinner here last night. I'm going to go ahead and give them 4 stars even though I do have two things to quib about. Were these resolved they easily get 5 stars. One is the fact that they have a ventilation system which is necessary to keep the place from stinking like the kitchen. At the same time, this creates a draft on half the seats which really isn't something you want. We had to change seats in the hope of not waking up the next day with sore necks. Luckily we received a table upstairs and had the whole level to ourselves which was very much to our liking. Second complaint is the wine pricing. By the glass, you only get 0,1 servings at prices which are usually for 0,2 size servings. Not a major big deal but still kind of high for the rest of the menu's very positive notes. There is also a 0,25 size serving but for two people this is also poor sizing. Anyway, these were very minor complaints on my end. On a very positive note service here is great. Super nice waitress who was more than attentive the whole evening and very helpful in making choices off the menu. We both had the pasta with truffles which was really good. Further, and I usually wouldn't comment on this, the bread served was amazing. Super tasty and warm which when eaten with the high quality olive oil rounded out our meal nicely. We also had dessert and were very impressed. We ordered the pistachio tarte and the chocolate tart which were both filled with creamy fillings. Dessert was the highlight of the meal. The interior is still, after being open a year, like new. I really like the mix of styling and it's a very comfortable atmosphere (outside of the draft). We'll definitely be back soon as this could easily become a favorite Italian place in the Innenstadt. I am making a point of coming back and trying it out for lunch when I have business appointments."
3,The food at this place is great and creative! I guess one of the most fun kitchens and quality on the Lange Reihe... With regards to service they can definitely improve and I leave it at that... The restaurant is simply worth a visit!!!
3,A very nice place in Hamburg to go for a walk. One round takes about 45 minutes. The park around the see is very calm and most people use it for running or biking. I have reduced my rating by one star because the places for a potential barbeque are very small and possibilities to clean up the charcoal are very rare in comparision to the Stadtpark.
3,If you order the Bio-Wuchtbrumme mit Grillgold you will receive a piece of organic meat soaked in a reddish curry dip served with french fries. - Go for it!
3,"I'm from Italy, Rome and I can say that you can find good real italian food here. It might be the only or one of the few place in Hamburg.Good prices and italian speaking staff. Good if you want to have a real italian restaurant experience :)"
4,"This is a great spot to catch a quick lunch. They serve fine cut meats from pork to turkey along with potato and kraut. There's two sizes; small and large at 6,90 and 8,90 euros. Very fair priced. You may sit inside or outside and enjoy your meal. Obviously they are other items on the menu but these are the main attraction in my opinion. Also great, the staff speak both German and English so that made my life easy"
4,Best coffee in town period. Try the pecorino or the homemade-cheese bagel. I saw yuppies and also mechanics take their coffee there the stuff doesn't care. Also try the sweet Cortado.
3,"Was there once , quiet atmosphere, a bit lack of character considering  middle eastern  . The waiter was little bit serous face , could be more  welcoming , smily and energetic. However the service was good , food is good quality too  although small portions for big belly :) Small menu but they do well what they offer .Price suits to what other restaurants offer in same area ."
2,"Maybe I just dreamt that I already reviewed here. Decent location in a nice square by the canal, and popular. The downside is the sometimes painfully slow service, and I've never been overwhelmed by the pasta. I would recommend Rialto, which is just next door. It is stylish though."
4,"Delicious! This place was small, but with a great personality.  The food was great and they gave my boyfriend and I huge portions.  I had the lox bagel with eggs and he had a fried mix fish platter.  The menu was in German and so we just used Google translate.  The staff was nice, attentive, and spoke some English.  No wifi."
3,"The location, service, and interior of this place is really nice. The running model train within the whole restaurant adds a cool feel also and I really felt like I was back in the states! Came here for the 4th of July to get my American fix. My partner tried the spare ribs, and I had the crispy chicken sandwich. The spare ribs were awesome, my partner was in heaven. The crispy chicken was nothing special however... next time I'd just go with a regular burger as it seems red meat is more their specialty? We also tried the cheesecake here and it was pretty good, but a pretty small slice for the price. Overall, worth a visit if you need some American flavor in your life!"
2,"Not bad! Ok, I had a pretty good time here. The drinks are pretty cheap and from what I can remember, the strawberry daquiri was really good! This is more of a dive bar and get shitfaced kind of place. The music was loud but not too loud thank god. I would probably come back."
1,Delicious food!!!Funky atmosphere!!!The entire experience was ruined by the waiter attempting to flirt with my boyfriend the whole time!!!
3,"I like to eat lunch here on Mondays and Fridays. Mondays, they usually have noodles, on Fridays, they have fish for today's lunch menu."
4,"I have been there a couple of time with friends visiting Hamburg. It's always been an incredible evening. Franco makes feel at home, but no only. The food is incredible. I cannot recommend enough this place."
1,"I was here 3 times. The first 2 times I came here with one person. The food were super super good, then I brought my other 3 friends here with full expectations but we all were disappointed this time. May be we came there at a wrong time (Easter time) or their main chef is on holiday, no idea. They offer Surprises Menu all the time. The first 2 time (2 persons), we had 6 warm+cold appentisers but this time 4 persons only had 5 appentisers and the portion was the same as for 2 persons. The beef was tough and no sauce for the whole dish. When we asked for a ketchup or sauce and they answered it is not their practice to offer sauce. We are very disappointed and don't know what is going on in this restaurant."
4,"BEST RESTAURANT IN HAMBURG...and maybe the world :-) I have eaten here a few times, as it is close to my place, and it is an amazing experience each and every time !!The food is always superb, and (counter-intuitively) the staff are friendly, warm, and welcoming, yes, even if you are a large party, normally dressed, and with a crying baby (what can I say, we like to push the limits). It is truly one of my favorite places to eat in the ENTIRE world, and will keep coming back even if I have to move from HBG."
3,"Knuth is a lovely and over-popular cafe in central Altona. Be prepared to wait around for at least 10 minutes before getting a table if you show up mid-morning on the weekend for breakfast. The menu is relatively simple. All the standard German breakfast options based around bread, cheese, meat, fruit and eggs are here. Nicely put together with quality ingredients and at a reasonable price. I like Knuth, but it does get a bit full of young parents..."
3,"It'sbeen ages since I was at Panter last time. To my satisfaction my visityesterday confirmed that: a) this place is as cool as it was before b) cosy, unpretentious, good quality c) friendly service d) unfortunately limitedchoice of drinks, i.e. wine This place will suite you if you are looking for a nice & cosy place to have a coffee and chat. It's not spectacular, just good."
4,"It is located beside the Alster so it is very suitable if you were there sight seeing and wanted to grab some quick sushi. The All-You-Can-Eat is for about 20 euros.You just sit and keep picking up the plates that you like, which is a variety of rolls, nigiri sushi, sashimi, and even dessert sometimes. I've went 3 times, and each time some of the plates are changed with new ones, so I guess the menu changes every day, but the main plates (nigiri and rolls are always served).You can also have a drink but can be a bit expensive, the AYCE with a small pepsi (0.33 litre) costs about 22.2 euros and with a big pepsi (0.5 litre) costs about 24.2 euros.My only comment is that the nigiri sushi contains too much rice and thin fish slices, and the lack of fried rolls (although there are fried prawns occasionally).--Update 1:I went for a fourth time, and this time they had fried rolls.The staff crew is also very friendly, and they recogized me from last time."
4,Very nice pub - good food - cosy atmosphere and lovely service!
4,"Fresh, high quality seafood.  Intimate sitting for 30 fills the restaurant. Proprietor hands on, serves as host and translator. Backyard party atmosphere, expect to relax and enjoy for hours as late arrivers are served to catch up on the set 4 course meal. Vegetarian service also offered. Guitarist adds to atmosphere. Generous host served special shots as we joined in watching Germany win the FIFA WC! Arriba!"
4,"We were able to book a last minute tour here in English. The guide was very informative and taught us a lot about the whole chocolate making process. We also got to taste the chocolate at different forms in the process and make our own bar to take home. If you're planning on visiting, I would recommend booking early, as there are not as many English tours available. Another bonus is that the bathroom here is FREE."
2,"This is OK Thai food for people who are not overly fussy about Thai food.I usually have pretty specific ideas about what the food I order is supposed to taste like. Nothing we ordered here tasted the way I thought it should have, but it was nice enough all the same.My husband ordered the cashew chicken which was generously portioned with nuts, veggies and meat in a flavorful sauce.I ordered a Tom Kha Gai which was a bit bland, but I soon fixed that up with some chilis in fish sauce (what they bring you in lieu of hot sauce). Was pleased. But then came my fried noodles which, in all fairness, more or less the exact same thing one gets at whatever Hamburg's equivalent of China Box is. Sure, it had bok choy and lots of meat in it, but it was absolutely flavorless and uninspired.We couldn't find anything resembling Phad Thai on the menu; maybe it was there and we missed it, but I was pretty disappointed about that. None of the awesome rice noodle dishes, no Pad See-Ew either.For the price, I thought we could have done much better at the dim sum up the street or even at the China Wok imbiss at the train station.The service was competent and the food was not bad, but we work hard for the little money we have and will spend it elsewhere in the future. Nothing wrong with paying a decent price for good food but that was not really what we found herejust mediocre versions of potentially amazing dishes for people without a lot of experience with Thai cuisine."
4,Very good restaurant if you want American food while in Germany. Terrific selection and superb taste. Lovely atmosphere and the bartender is a sweetheart.
3,"I have had many a doner in many a German city, but I am putting it out there - this is the best. I was guided here by a Turkish employee at my hotel, so I had high hopes. They were fulfilled. The meat is sliced fresh, and you have multiple meat choices. The flatbread is pressed and cooked fresh, meaning it's hot and delicious. There are many other choices too, from chicken wings to lamb. The restaurant itself has some tables and is a bit beat up, but fine. I subtract a star because you come out smelling like doner for a day thanks to all of the smoke and poor ventilation in the cooking area. But, it's worth it."
4,"Absolute professional and lovely, remembers most customers favourite orders, makes good jokes and even has some books for kids."
3,"Good after works, happy hours & some random students. Quite a nice location in city center, venue itself is trying to be cool and modern. Food is not my highest choice, but drinks are definitely 8out of 10! So for Thursday evening after work drink - big yes!"
3,Mi Xao Gion was wig! Amazing. Def reco. She Pho Chay was shook. Also loved the spring rolls and the spicy glass noodle salad. Authentic decor too and friendly staff. Check it out. Also seems like most staff speaks English.
3,StrandPauli has a great location at the Hamburg harbour. Its a great place to hang out in the beach chairs enjoying the sun. The service was unfortunately a bit slow especially compared to the amount og people. And it would be nice with some heating lamps and blankets for sundown. Prices were reasonable. I'll be back!!
4,"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday...delicious eggs with Krabben (little shrimp from the North Sea), good croissants and brötchen, top notch butter and marmalade, good coffee, excellent service. Sweet little place with tables outside, but not too many."
4,"My husband and I bought combo tickets to the zoo and the aquarium (60 euros altogether), and after three hours enjoying the zoo, I wasn't sure that I had the stamina to tour the aquarium. I'm so glad that I powered through, because it was even better than the zoo! My husband does not speak or read any German, and my competency is slightly above elementary, but we found that more of the signage at the aquarium is in both English and German than the signage in the zoo. Even though the name clearly reads ""tropics/aquarium,"" I was expecting to see only water creatures. Wrong: this is where the lemurs and lizards and snakes live, too! I was expecting to see the lemurs in the zoo portion, but no, they are the first exhibit one encounters in the ""tropics/aquarium"" part. I loved the design of the space: the maze-like way one moves from exhibit to exhibit, the seemingly hand-written and hand-drawn signs, and the neat way that the environs of the smaller animals are presented in wooden cabinets as in the Renaissance cabinet of curiosities. Imagine an aquarium and zoo presented in a venue like Sir John Sloane's Museum in London, and that's very close to what one encounters here. If we had been pressed for time and could have only done one venue, I would choose here over the actual zoo, it's so good."
4,"I love this place for lunch. Found it a couple months back and am here about every two or three weeks. I like that their menu constantly changes and I haven't had one bad dish in my opinion. You have the like the style of food but if you do, you won't be disappointed. Now that it's getting warmer out, I'm glad they have the tables outside. It's usually packed at noon so the outdoor seating allows things to overflow to the outdoors a bit. Glad I found this place as I find the quality and taste of food worth the extra couple Euros you end up paying here. Insider tip is to try out some of the local drinks they have on the menu. Today for example had the coconut mild and mango shake. Really tasty along with the chicken curry dish I ordered."
3,Great place for an evening stroll or a nice day in the sun. Flowers are abundant in spring and summer with well maintained grounds with plenty of places to sit. A huge playground for the kiddies is a must do if you have a little one along for the ride. Date night has an interesting opportunity with evening fountain and light shows during the summer. This city hideaway feels like its miles from everything while being minutes from most.
3,"Barley & Malt is an Irish pub in the center of Hamburg at the Deichstraße close to the building where the great fire started in 1842. The street is very nice and it is possible to sit outside in the summer. The interior and the decoration are similar to most Irish pubs I have been to. The TV screens show football, rugby or cricket.  The pub offers several snacks and small dishes. I only tried the Nachos which tasted good.To access the pub you need to go up some stairs."
4,"Great restaurant that really has it all:* Fun location at the heart of bustling Eimsbüttel.* An eclectic interior design that mixes a boar's head with Riviera style bookshelves full of cook books and golden candlestick-holders.* A really innovative menu of German dishes with a modern twist.* And friendly staff with enough personality to give non-boilerplate recommendationsWe tremendously enjoyed the giant pork chops in cocoa cauce, goat cheese apple burgers, a lovely Spanish red wine made of Grenache and Tempranillo grapes, and a lovely sweet but crisp dessert wine that wasn't on the menu."
4,"If I was ever to make a lunch- and coffee spot, this would be the perfect model for it. You can tell a lot of passion has gone into this place.It's simply brilliant. The decor is so trendy, in my mind it could be a magazine cover. And there's full insight into the kitchen, so there's no doubt that the food is   the real deal. As if there ever would be any once you've tried it. The food isn't fancy, but the the quality in all of it's simpleness is incredible. It's like something your grandma would cook.The location, if you don't know it, is a really friendly, hipster-y part of town with various stores selling all kinds of pretty things you don't really need... So there's things to see here, and this is the perfect place to take a break.To address previous reviewers: I ordered in english without any problems; cashier was both patient and helpful."
3,"The food was good, we ordered the schanke and the steak. Both was really good. We ordered the apfelstrudeln as dessert and this we can recommend. The reason for the 4 star is that we had to wait for 45min for the main dishes. That was a long wait for the relatively simple dishes. This is of course disputable, but that's how we felt. The strudeln came after 15min too. The check? Guess what, it came in with a minute."
4,"A newcomer on Hamburg Irish bar scene: there have been a few already and this one looks promissing too!Wonderful interior, lots of green of course (you can't skeep that) friendly service, beer and other drinks. And yes, they speak English!The highlight for me is karaoke, which they want to do regularly. Also wiskey tasting is another event they host.Let's see what comes next. Irish dance evenings perhaps?"
4,"Usually portions in Germany are pretty huge and I am not able to finish them. That was not a case in this place, but not because the portion was too small. It was just so tasty:) Also, I definitely recommend Scweinemedallions mit käse:D Also I'm a big soup fan, so that will be my next thing there to try out, as for I saw they serve it inside big piece of bread.Should be tasty. They also have vegetarian menu, pizzas, salads and what else not, so there definitely should be something for everybody.Prices are really ok, too.Other than that this place is great because of its location and its really has that vibe, that you want to spend there all those rainy Hamburg evenings."
3,"Been here a few times. Cozy little place with a good selection of burgers to choose from. Love the fries too. You usually order up front at the counter. For the non german speaking folks, the lady behind the counter asks if you want ketchup or mayonnaise with your fries, and if it's a take away or not. The service is quick, and there is outdoor seating available if it's summer (and not raining)."
3,Pretty good place for a burrito. not the cheapest place to eat but great food.
4,"What a find -- Xeôm greets you with an interior that wants to put you in the middle of a street stall scene in Vietnam without overdoing it. I really wonder how they got the confused, curled wiring of the lighting past a German electrician! :)They serve a very limited menu, which obviously often helps quality.It certainly does so here - authentic, very tasteful, and reasonably priced too. Don't overlook the homemade drinks, but note that some are somewhat sweet, so ask ahead.Brilliant place that fills up quickly despite its location 'around the corner', for good reason!"
4,This is definitely my best Italian restaurant in Hamburg. Fresh seafood served right at the table. Much better than some sushi places in the town.
4,"After many years come back to this well known place The prices still in the upper range makes the expectations grow :)The food still one of the best, fresh herbes, fresh fish, real Thai taste Excellent! I like to sit at the window, the big room inside  even with a lot of high style Thai decoration  does not make me feel comfortable."
2,"Sausalitos is pretty much a night club that serves food. This place is really nice for a bar/club but i wouldnt really call it a restaurant. The food is what made me drop off a star from the review. We went there with a large group of people and had a table reserved. The service was really great and fast considering the place is packed (it was a thursday during their happy hour specials). The food is your typical bar finger food. Considering they advertise themselves as a mexican restaurant i thought maybe the nachos would be good. I ordered the nachos and the cheese was extremly hard and a pain to seperate each chip. I got the guac and salsa on the side. Spoiler alert: the guac here is NOT green...it was a little grey looking and it barely tasted like guac. The waiter confirmed it was the guac i ordered. I would highly reccomend to stay away from the nachos. The food might not be great but the drinks are AMAZING! They have really fun cocktails here and awesome specials during happy hour. I got the 'flying kangaroo' and it tasted like a milkshake and you dont event feel the alcohol, but there is a ton in there. Also, the drink sizes were HUGE! The ambiance is totally a club feel, the music is WAY too loud you will find yourself screaming at your friends sitting next to you. In the basement they have the 'club' which has hip hop music, different than the 'restaurant' upstairs."
3,"Great service; friendly, observant, and check in with customers often. They do not except tips, and will make sure to hand it back to you, stating ""das werd nicht nötig, aber bis nächstes mal."" But I still recommend trying ;) Last, but certainly not least, the food was fantastically, authentically full of wonderfully spiced and seasoned flavors. I highly recommend this restaurant. Minus one star from Perfect, simply because the option on the menu for meals was a little confusing. But in the end I found the Ente and the veggie dish to be just what I wanted."
2,"Fine but not stellar sushi.  One of the few sushi places I passed on my wanders that actually had customers, which is a good sign.I got a basic Menu 4, with some roe-covered California rolls and two nigiri; the fish was in that middle bland area, not tongue-bursting fresh and not old.  Rice was fine, and not too gummy.OK if you're in the area, but maybe not worth much of a trip."
3,"The perfect place in Hamburg to sit and have a coffee/wine/beer and soak in the scene. Please forgive my American-ness but this joint is quintessential European. I felt like I was in a movie every time I walked by/sat for a drink. Fantastic people watching, clean bathrooms, speedy & courteous service. Babies, old people, young people, hipster parents, men that wear red pants, you can find them all here."
0,"Mice in the restaurant, unfriendly host - not recommended!This was my 3rd time at L'Osteria at Opernplaza/Dammtorstrasse in Hamburg and by far the worst experience.The host that greeted us was unkind and rude when we suggested to wait at the bar for our table. He lectured us that we would take away seats for other customers - well, we just wanted to wait for table - go figure....Anyways, the worst part was the mice that were running around in the restaurant. When we told the waitress she waived our concerns away, telling us this would be common in the inner city. I wonder what the Hamburgian health department's opinion is on this topic...This said, this was my last visit since the pizza was mediocre as well."
3,"I went on an English Hamburg Dungeon tour with my friend and it was really fun! It was informative and easy to understand, though I will admit that more of the focus is on the effects and experience. My friend got a little creeped out, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who can't walk through your basic haunted house."
1,"The food was just about OK but what I was really annoyed is that there was a large group of people sitting next to our table making so much noise, laughing and chatting loudly. Later I realised that they were either friends or family of the owners. My point is that if the owner wanted a family get together, they should have closed the restaurant for others!"
3,"This place is always packed with young people. Very nice atmosphere and extremely cheap coffee. You can buy there soft drinks, snacks and cakes too."
4,"Great food (especially fish and seafood), great service, great location, great atmosphere  THE place for perfect dinner, be it romantic for two or family or dinner with your visitors in Hamburg. It is not cheap and little bit of touristy, but every bite is worth it."
3,"Really like this place - nice coffee, alternative folks, loungy music.Need a location to celebrate? You can even rent the Bacana for private parties, the owner is definitely a laid back dude. Just be sure you organize a few things yourself, if you need a DJ or anything ;)The Bacana is nice for breakfast and coffee during day, but also a cosy location to hang out later. Contra (to me): sometimes the guys smoke, which you can smell the next day while wanting to have breakfast"
4,Absoluter Fan. Standard bei mir Habibi mit Hühnchen und Jalapenos plus scharfer Sosse. Ideal für ein schnelles Mittag oder Abendessen!
3,This is a really nice restaurant! Really relaxing and enjoyable. I ordered a sandwich with pesto and it was really good!
4,Possibly the best Wurst stand in Hamburg. A great variety of freshly grilled Wurst and always quickly served. A great snack when you're shopping or just passing through. What's great is that you don't have to cross the busy road as they have a stand on either side and they're right at the Mönckebergstraße U-Bahn Station. My personal favourite is the Bison Wurst.
2,"We were there on a pretty quiet evening, but I hear that is is pretty insane during Oktoberfest.  The food was traditional southern German and pretty tasty, I had the smoked pork chop and kale, both were excellent, the pork chop wasn't what I consider pork chop, it was more like a pork loin steak, but great flavor."
2,"Staff here are really super friendly! They seem serious about their coffee with lots of options on the menu.But it's not a cozy or comfortable place where I'd want to hang out for long, a second drink etc..My non-coffee drink (chai latte) was rather lukewarm, flavour on the dull side. The many happy Yelp voices suggest that coffee drinkers might be luckier here."
4,"So you're looking for something to do in Hamburg aren't we all. If you're a car enthusiast this is a must see. At the time of my visit they had a collection of Porsche, Formula 1, and a couple super cars. Very thorough and detailed exhibits offering the back story to each car and in many cases a short video. Takes lots of photos, plenty of desktop art found here. Excellent for English visitors, and German natives. Entrance is 10 euros, they accept credit cards."
4,"One of the nicest locations in Hamburg to eat, drink and listen to music. The old LighthouseShip is placed near the Überseebrücken and is painted red. You will find it. You can choose: Sitting outside on deck an drink a bear or eat something or go down into the the engineroom, where a nice bar is placed. There you hear often Live Jazz Music. I think it was on mondays. A few rooms are even a small hotel on board.Enjoy"
0,"Walked in without a reservation expecting to have to wait a long time and instead got a death stare and a NO!  Hey, how about so sorry but please come back when you  have a reservation, but no we got the dirtiest look. How dare we try to eat there!"
3,"I go here quite a lot as its just down the road, does very nice food but most importantly we get a great welcome.There are probably hundreds of Italian restaurants in Hamburg, but this is the place where we take Qype staffers visiting the city for the first time.It usually has a table, and the prices are pretty keen as well."
3,"I'm not from Hamburg, but it seems to be a cool coffee house, with reasonable prices! Our couchsurfer took us there, and he knows the people running this joint. I took a red tea which was good. The Sunday brunch seems tasty and diverse. Since I am a vegan, I didn't find much to eat there, therefore didn't order it. I would be happy to see some more vegetables and maybe avocado or something that us vegan can eat."
3,"They were super busy when we arrived but managed to give us a table. We ordered quickly and the food came out surprisingly fast as well! I had the salmon, it's was so tasty! Definitely going back next time I'm in Hamburg."
4,"Exploring lunch options in the neighborhood, I came here because it was the highest rated place on Yelp. And rightfully so. Turns out it's actually more of a breakfast place, but that's okay. The service is very friendly. (I didn't feel like I was bothering the staff with my money, as is often the case in Hamburg.) The lady behind the counter was really cool. Although breakfast was over and some items were sold out, she told me what they had available and helped me pick something. The spinach quiche sounded good. And it was! Himalaya salt and black pepper at hand, it left me wanting another. Alas! The price was a bit steep at 4.50€. However it came with a simple side salad with fresh, beautiful looking vegetables and balsamic vinaigrette. I appreciate the effort; too many places are serving premix salads nowadays.I don't usually order filter coffee (prefer cafe crema/ americano) but my pocket change was limited today and it was the cheapest option. It came served with *warmed-up* milk on the side (nice detail) and a little biscotti. It also tasted good! Ok, Filter Coffee. You get a second chance.The locals are diverse. Great people watching from the window seats. The atmosphere is nice, cozy, and not overly cute as is the trend lately. The music is also pretty great. They picked some local station that plays many classics among other current pop hits from around Europe.I can't find anything against this place. The prices are acceptable considering that quality items and friendly service seem to be primary concerns here. 5 stars earned. I'll definitely come back."
0,Service is very slow. Took us over two hours since we sat down to finally get our food. Unbelievable. This is on a Tuesday night. Food was mediocre at best. Will not return.
4,yes it really is the best bratwurst in hamburg. ask for an extra roll of bread as theyre very fresh there
3,"If you are looking for a good after hours spot on a Thursday night in Germany check this place out.  It's a nice bar for the regular fruity bar drinks and also a good regular one.  Keep in mind you might have to wait a little at the bar; however, being from Miami I am kind of used to that in the clubs.  The music was good more hip hop if that what you are into.  I didn't eat there so I cant speak for the food, but I think it's best to go and eat there early if you are hungry.  Otherwise you will be standing up.  I would go again when I'm in town."
3,Pizza Siciliana was great but the pizza Diavola was extremely spicy! I love spicy food but it was too much.
1,"Solid drinks, a bit overpriced though. Ambiance is generic / OK, you could smell the toilets inside the bar. It's not living up to its hype. Staff is not very attentive."
3,"Christiansen's has a reputation of one of the best cocktail bars in Hamburg, where bartenders take seriously (meaning participating and winning bartender competitions) mixing all sorts of concoctions.So I thought it will be very trendy place, full of action, hot people, noise, bartenders shaking/mixing/stirring  you've got the picture. But no, very quiet, cool, relaxing place. They have all sorts of drinks of course and the list of cocktails is unbelivable. On Monday you can get free massage, which I absolutely have to try next time!"
4,Excellent! Once of the best Thai meals I've had outside of Thailand.
4,"Had a great 3 course lunch menu here for EUR6.90: salad buffet, soup and a choice of main courses. Impressed."
4,"I had come to Hamburg to listen to the magnificent Kate Tempest and my parents decided to come with me. Not to listen to the words of a slam poet, but to eat food and see the city, mind. We found Sagners because of the great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. Because we like to eat in our family, but usually don't have the stomach space to contain all the food we want to devour, we came to Sagners not that hungry. But there is a little something for everyone here. I had scrambled eggs with shrimp on blackbread, which could be awfully dull, but actually tasted like fresh shrimp straight from the sea combined with perfectly scrambled eggs. It was good. Sitting outside is not that attractive as it leads to a pretty busy road, but you'll soon forget it with all of that German beer and seaside fare inside you."
4,"I've eaten at the bistro twice. Last time was last sunday which was a very busy day. The weather was hot and sun shining so the outdoor terrace was crowded. The service was slow because the staff was short due to several waiters being ill, so we got our drinks 15 minutes after we received our food. But they apologized and explained the situation. We didn't mind the tardiness. The food was also amazing and made up for it. It is also the only place I've seen that serves Nigerian Mountain tea. The day we were there they hade some musician playing on the square outside and Carls served drinks to the audience. Very nice atmosphere. Perfectly fitting for Hafencity. In the bistro they have a store where you can buy spices, tea and other things from their own brand Carls, wine from the related brand Louis C Jacob (Hotel and michelin-star restaurant C Jacob and Carls have the same owner), as well as lemonade, vineager, olive oil, cookies etc from various french brands. I LOVE the combination of bistro and store. And since the store is in the bistro it is open on Sundays which is a rarity in Hamburg.I bought Carls spices, Carls Elbe sea salt (profit goes to the elbe philharmonie foundation), avocado oil, Louis C Jacob's rosé wine (very nice btw) and Darjheeling tea. Oh and if you are there, either at the Carls bistro or the next door Carls brasserie, you HAVE to check out the ladies room. They look like they are from a old french movie from the 1920s, with upper half of the walls covered in in black and beige striped wallpapers, and the lower half in beige tiles, and the fllor in black and white tiles. And cool square shaped toilet seats to match. They also have a nice dressing room outside the toilets. Next time I'm in Hamburg I will visit the brasserie."
3,"Great location with a greater view. The atmosphere is cozy. My dish was very good, the other that we ordered was medium. However- it is a great place to go and see Hamburg from above. Be sure to make a reservation. Our waitress was fantastic and we felt good there."
4,"I wish Panter was closer to where I live. It's one of the coolest cafes in Hamburg, but I never go here because it's a bit out of the way for me. The menu is a little bit limited, but what they offer they do well. For breakfast there is a selection of omelets and later the menu reverts to being just soup, salad, pasta or paninis. They also have a yummy-looking range of cakes."
2,"This is a good place for lunch if you're looking for something on the healthy side. If I were vegetarian, I would probably eat here a lot. The food isn't strictly vegetarian, but most of the dishes are, or at least lean in that direction (meat as an accompaniment, rather than the main event).I've tried their pasta (I think it was gnocchi), and their sweet potato curry (with chickpeas). Both dishes were filling but not exactly bursting with flavor. The rice that came with my curry had been par-boiled, and then boiled again just before serving, but apparently not enough because it was still a little too chewy.On the plus side, food is served cafeteria-style, so you can get in and out quickly, and you can see what you're getting.Not my favorite place for lunch, but not terrible, either."
4,Absolutely awesome!  We'll worth a reason to visit Hamburg alone!  We took backstage tour offered for some extra euros. We were lucky to have taken the tour since we were only two. Great insight of the technology used.
4,"What a magical world they have created! Halls over halls filled with impressive and amusing details, this railroad model museum took this art form to another level. Even if you haven't heard of it, it is quite an experience. Although I was skeptical at first, the imagination and skills of the two brothers undoubtably deserve our admiration. It was adorable how they took inspiration from actual travels to the different countries and made the landscapes their own. You could spend days here discovering new details...It was great to see they had several opportunities to donate to the respective countries' struggles- a way to give back in a playful setting. We also appreciated the free beverages and perfectly organized waiting room area while waiting 45 minutes to get in. Proud that Germany has such a wonderfully unique museum to offer!"
4,"Absinthe is certainly something different. Run by a couple who had been ""talking about setting up an Absinthe bar for 6 years"", they got around the legal issues of selling such poison a year ago, and are now living the dream. There's something very odd about this place. The ambiance is almost out of a vampire film, and quaffing copious quantities of the green stuff only amplifies it. The selection of spirits is extremely comprehensive. I would guess they basically have everything, and serve it in style. You could also take a beer here, but why would you? If I had to pick holes (apart from the ones in the walls!), I'd be that the seating is not conducive to curling up and going to sleep. I'd imagine this is deliberate! 5/5."
3,Excellent cheap Indian food as evidenced by how crazy busy they were this Wednesday night. Got the veggie thali and okra curry for 6euros each. Very busy around 7:15 on a weekday- ended up waiting more than 30 mins for our food. (Thus minus one star). Otherwise very flavorful and the mango lassi was perfect on a summer day.
3,"Very cheap and delicious fresh tasting food. The falafel isn't anything special but tastes among the best I've had in Hamburg. I ordered the ""falafel box"" which was pretty much a small sampler of all their vegetarian items on a small plate for 4€ (includes three falafel balls). Everything tasted fresh and very good - I was very happy with the meal for the cheap price.There's actually like 5+ falafel places right next to each other in this area. I've only tried Falafelstern and Kimo (the restaurant literally next door also serving falafel). I would definitely recommend Falafelstern over Kimo for better tasting falafel and sides."
4,Fantastic fantastic fantastic place to see for kids of all ages. We have been 3 times now and every time we discover something new. Italy is still under construction and I can't wait to come back next year to see it completed!!! It's a don't miss when you are in Hamburg!!!
3,"Very pleasant deli cum bistro overlooking the new concert hall in Hafencity. When building is complete, this will be a great location. Right now, as with many of the places in hafencity you sit partially in the midst of a building site. Not dirty, but certainly noisy. But with tasty salads, expertly cooked pasta (and the not tried but good looking flammkuchen and tartines) this is still a really good lunch spot. And watching Hafencity go up around you is perhaps part of the charm!"
3,"Pretty decent little St. Pauli pub in Eimsbuttel. It gets packed when there's a game on. For the nice summer days they have a large number of benches and tables outside, allowing Urknall to double as a bier garden"
3,"We went there to grab some breakfast. They are not only a cafe but they also do lunch and other small snacks. I chose the soy yogurt with nuts and honey, which I found in their refrigerated section. They offer two different flavors of soy yogurt. They also have quite a big and tasty looking selection of sandwiches and bagels on display. Interior is nice and welcoming, prices are moderate, some are okay others are overpriced (2€ for fruit infused water) but all in all it's a great place for a quick breakfast or lunch."
1,I went into the meatery last night after have a few cocktails on the roof top of the hotel. I didn't feel like having steak so I opted for a burger. I got the classic burger which was a disappointment.  The burger was cold and not cooked to my liking. I got the brioche bun which was flat and not what I am used to a brioche bun being like.  The fries were good and piping hot . Overall I was disappointed I would never order there burger again.
4,Definately one of the best chinese restaurants in Hamburg. When the boss is there he enjoys to advise and explain the traditional chinese dishes at the back of the menu. Lots of chinese customers here as well.To access the restaurant you need to go up some stairs.
3,"Jim Block used to be my favourite burger in Hamburg, but I've gone off the place recently. They display very little care putting their burgers together. The only things that sets them apart from other fast food burger joints is a) the higher priceb) you get a platec) the ingredients are of a slightly higher quality If you want a burger, are sick of the American chains, and don't want to spend the time to go to a real restaurant, then this is Jim Block's niche. You get a decent burger, no more"
4,Zum Spatzle  is amazing. Do not pass up this charming restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful.  I had the lentils and spatzle and it was fantastic.  I plan to go back and try the soups and more spatzle. Thank you for my first great dining experience in Hamburg.
4,"Awesome Beer, Fantastic Food, perfect environment and a wonderful staff to boot. I love this place and can't say enough positive things about it!"
4,"Great food, fast and friendly service, and good prices.I had some lamb chops here and they were absolutely spectacular! The lamb was very tender and full of taste. The rice was well-flavoured. The salad was made with a great variety of ingredients and was very zesty. The overall combination of flavours was well-selected and the layout of the food was really colourful.Although the outdoor seating has a very 'fast-food BBQ' sort of feel to it, the indoor seating looks much more like a restaurant. The décor is colourful and lively, and the place does have a rather 'busy' feel to it.I'd recommend stopping by here if you're in the neighbourhood."
3,"Ay Carumba! Casa Franco is so much fun. I came here last night with some friends and I had a great time. For 27 euros you get a four-course meal complete with a flaming scallop starter, fish, more fish, and a delicious dessert. Mmm. The owner of the restaurant is fantastic. He's so attentive to his customers and makes a huge effort to entertain the entire restaurant. We got several free shots of alcohol and the entire restaurant toasts together. The atmosphere is cozy, festive, and lively. There was even a traditional guitar singer that serenaded us twice in the night. My favorite part of my four course meal was the parrot fish and the crème brûlée-like dessert. I'm not sure what it was, but it was GOOD. We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was 22 euros a bottle. I'd say the style of the food was Portuguese fusion. The fun part is that the chef decides what you will eat so you don't have to order your food. The fish that he served us was extremely fresh. I think this is a great place to go with some friends or to celebrate a special occasion like a birthday. At the end of the meal, the owner also gives the ladies a single rose. :) Four solid stars for the food, and 7 stars for the service. I'll most likely be back!"
4,The town hall of Hamburg is with his 647 rooms bigger than the Buckingham Palace.Some places of the town hall are only visitable through a guidance. Conclusion:The town hall of Hamburg is very historical and beautiful. It is a visit worth!
2,"It seems as if most major cities have a Hofbrahaus, and it's not a bad choice in my opinion since the food and beer are at least decent. I'm not German, so I can't speak for the authenticity of the cuisine. I can, however, speak for my satisfaction.The English menu is pared down compared to the German menu, so look back and forth between the two to get a full understanding of the selection - especially the beers. I ordered the pork shank. The skin was charred to a semi-darken crisp that enveloped the layers of succulent meat and gelatinous fat inside. Its entirety was sitting upon savory but slightly sour gravy. Served alongside were pickled root vegetables and a warm potato dumpling. While the food was appetizing, it was difficult to cut the pork without having the flakey skins fly everywhere. Fortunately I was wearing my throw-away clothes, so I didn't mind spilling gravy and pulling oily flakes of pork skin off my shirt. Note that the portions are HUGE! I could only finish half my plate. If dining with friends, I would suggest splitting the dishes. Because I came in during the afternoon on a day that was between Christmas and New Years, it was relatively empty. I am sure this place gets packed and rowdy during football matches since they have large television screens broadcasting games. The interior consists primarily of large picnic bench seating - ideal for groups of 6 or more. There are some two-person table sets, but I wouldn't go here to have an intimidate date or conversation.Overall, I would recommend this place if you would like good food and beer over a casual conversation with a group of friends (think ""happy hour"" and work event type of space)"
2,"This has been on our list to try based on the reviews. Sadly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the sushi. My hubby and I ordered the echtasien Mix II, so we can try a variety of rolls. The platter comes with 2 maki, 2 special rolls, 4 nigiri, 6 sashimi and 2 shrimp tempura. It sounds like a lot but the rolls are rather small and we didn't leave dinner too full, i.e. I could've eaten more. There weren't many choices for the special rolls since they had to be under 9€ for the mix platter. The food came out fast, which was awesome. The quality of fish seemed good, but the rolls fell apart really easily.Our waiter was really nice, the restaurant itself felt warm and cozy even though it is quite big, and it's located in a nice area. It would be a nice place for a date night. The quality and pricing of food was not comparatively better than other sushi restaurants we've been to, though. Perhaps the non-sushi dishes are good, but I don't think I would come back here just for the sushi."
4,Delicious! The jumbo portion is too much for one person. The prices are right and the curry sauce they use is amazing. This place has probably the best currywurst I've ever eaten. Beats many places in Berlin out of the water.
3,"I was walking around hungry in this fantastic neighborhood when this random German girl came up to me and suggested this place. And she wasn't kidding, the food here is top notch. Low key (meaning not fancy) decor, typical menu for this kind of cuisine but the quality is fantastic. I had the falafel with halloumi and it was fried on-the-spot...amazing. The counter is small and crowded, but service is brisk and you get your food fast even when there is a lineup (there is always one here apparently, which is a great sign). The crowd here is very mixed which makes it interesting. And it cheap, cheap, CHEAP (my dish plus bottled water around €5). Recommended!"
4,Super great food.  Someone back there knows their way around the kitchen!  Great service.  Extremely friendly.  Nice and reasonable lunch specials.  Very nce atmophere; well decorated.  Grab a bite when you are waiting for the Miniature Museum.
3,"Huge dishes - we went for traditional lamb & duck, the steak tartare looked a bit overwhelming (neighbouring table ordered it).  Very cool basement setting with high arched ceilings between old columns"
3,"Came here with my wife on a Wednesday night, and we were surprised by the 20 minute queue.  From the smells going around, we can understand why.It's a small space that is stylishly designed reminding of Ramen houses we've been to in Vancouver, BC.  We ordered the katsu don which was a little greasy and on the large side, but it was still crispy.  My wife had the special shio ramen, and I had the special miso ramen.  The shio ramen stock was much lighter than we were used to, but it was good after cracking the tamago and mixing around the yolk.  The miso ramen was fantastic.  Great creamy broth and a little spicy. Is it the best ramen restaurant I've been to?  I would say no, since we've been to ones in London, Seattle, and Vancouver.  For having this place in Hamburg, it's the most authentic thing I've had in a long time.  Big plus that the servers speak Japanese.  We're adding this to our monthly rotation of restaurants for sure."
3,"My usual usage of Irish pubs is based on large TV screens and football - with little else of merit, so I approached the Irish Rover with trepidation. But this is an Irish pub as it should be: Dark, cosy, welcoming, friendly, Kilkenny and Guinness on tap and good solid food! In particular the Guinness was as good as it gets outside Dublin and the fish and chips comes with real chips (not frites, not french fries, CHIPS!!). The clientele was a mix of ex pat Brits and Irish and young Germans. Always a good sign. You would take a place like this for granted in Dublin or London. But for this frequently travelling Brit finding a good traditional pub in Hamburg whose attraction is based on good beer, food and company, was a real joy."
4,"If you ever want to take friends out in Hamburg, make sure you visit this place first. The setting of within the gay area Talstraße with its drag-prostitutes might be a bit unusual at first but the 3-zimmer-wohnung totally makes up for it. The interior is amazing, the bar staff very friendly and the prices cheap! They have special evenings where a guy reads poems and short stories in German, which is quite entertaining and the foosball basement hosts various tounaments.Oh, and the ancient dildo collection is a must-see! Apparently they found this sealed room underneath the bar and when they broke it open, they found all these old dildos. They put them in display cabinets around the foosball tables. Go and check them out!"
4,"A very cute cafe with delicious drinks and pastries! Came here last week to meet some friends for coffee and I'm so glad they chose this spot! I had their filtered coffee and a piece of one of their in house baked cakes ( almond cake?). Both items were very tasty! The staff was super friendly and was quick to make my coffee! I was told that they make most of their pastries and cakes in house and looks like all their offerings are delicious. They had the cutest cookies and petit fours next to the register and I was tempted to buy them all! Actually later that night I got to try some more of their cakes and pastries! We tried a piece of their blueberry cheesecake which was really tasty. We also had an assortment of chocolate treats which were equally as good! There was one treat that was like a salted caramel chocolate tart...sooo good!Highly recommend this place to catch up with a friend over great coffee and delicious sweet treats. Also, this place takes only cash!"
4,"Wonderful cafe for breakfast, desserts or fancy coffee drinks. The warm crumble with ice cream was a special favorite. It has a very warm and cozy atmosphere."
4,"if you haven't been there, go there! the miniaturwunderland is a incredible place. suited in beautiful old warehouses of the hamburger speicherstadt two model railway freaks built the worlds biggest model railway. they started 2001 with a model of the hamburg harbour but since then the wonderland has grown continuesly year by year. the alps, norway, switzerland, usa, etc. everything is sculptured beautifully and filled with tons of details (which are the true highlights of the hole thing, because you can find millions of funny and bizarre everyday situations, which often refer to current news/events, i.e. strike of the bundsbahn 2007). and it is not only about railways, the whole thing is a computer controlled super system, which includes day and night changes every five minutes, streets full of traffic, police and fire brigade operations, boats travelling on the seas and in the harbour, etc... amazing! and it is getting bigger and bigger every day..."
3,Great food and good service. Food came out quite fast considering how busy it was. Also portions was generous.
4,"Nicely situated along the Elbe and the sous-chef that started this dining fusion concept used to be associated with the Landhaus Scherrer from what I was told. It is a bit out of the way to reach if you do not have a car, as the nearest public transportation by train is Landungsbrücken or taking a bus (112) along the Elbechausse. Once you arrive, the place is neatly organized, however due to lack of space and popularity of its infamous reputation, they pack tables in a bit too tightly. It is one great room with everyone lined up so closely, I can hear my neighbor chewing their salad.  Not a good seating situation for the claustrophobic, however, the food is so nice and service impeccably attentive, that one easily forgives the spacial limitations and enjoys the intimacy of the surroundings instead. All sushi is delicious, I mean, really. If you love sushi, order by favorite ingredients, as we all have our personal favorites that we crave consistently, but if feeling more adventurous, one can do no wrong here. Fresh, tasty, exotic rolls, that satisfy.You pay for sushi quality, so expect a reasonably pricey bill at the end of your meal, particularly if you are the type to go Rambo like myself and order with big eyes and a curious stomach :)  When sushi is of a higher caliber of quality, I often opt for sashimi, so not to waste my low carb diet on rice and extra sauces when the fish alone tastes marvelous enough with a spot of low sodium soy sauce and swipe of wasabi for good measure, topped with a ginger garnish! Sehr Lecker...If with a friend, do some fresh light appetizers, order a variety platter, and a bottle of Riesling, followed up with a warm chocolate dessert if available.  You will leave feeling like you just fell from sushi heaven.  I normally take in this experience with a friend, when we feel like having a nice, quiet, special sushi dinner away from the Mitte madness.My only complaint? I wish it was not so far from my home and off of a main public transportation route, but tis the price one pays for the views that can only be witnessed next to the Elbe River."
3,"I like Café Brooks. It is a nicely decorated coffee shop, with very nice staff. I enjoy the variety of cakes and the different tea flavors. On the weekend there is breakfast offer. You can choose your breakfast by ticking boxes on the breakfast menu. The breakfast was very tasty and the staff was very nice. As the coffee shop was very crowded we had to wait for a while to be served."
4,"Good quality and quantity, best sea food in town. But if you go there during busy hour you may need to wait for a while or need reservation"
2,"A very standard place in Ottensen. Nice but nothing extraordinary. I am quite surprised at how often this place fills up. The food is average if that. The interior is about the same as 50 other places in Hamburg. The crowd is also your typical Ottensen hipster-wannabe. If in the area, stop in and grab some food but don't bring extensive expectations or foresee a memorable evening. Just a local place to grab food and beer."
4,"Really nice Café: I love to sit outside, drinking excellent Cappuccino or Latte! Far to much of good cakes for me...One of my favorite Cafés in Hamburg !"
4,"This place definetly is kind of unusual.You have to order at the counter get buzzer and have to pick it up once it is ready. The neighborhood is a bit rough but safer than it appears at first glance so dont't worry to much.The ""restaurant"" itself is also rather simple and focuses on providing good food without any bling bling. The food itself is super awesome if you order a Thali dish you get a metal plate with lentil soup, salad, bread, rice and sauces and everything tastes very good. I mostly get the Palak Paneer and it just tastes greate.This certenly is a hidden gem that is getting popular so it sometimes it is hard to get a seat."
3,"So good I had to go twice in less than 24 hours! If you thought culinary creativity was limited to Heston Blumthing and his Fat Duck, think again. Had I had the good grace in school to bother studying German, rather than bunking off to mess around in the park, I might have understood what I was ordering. Luckily for me I didn't. Lucky, because I ended up randomly picking something from the menu, and it turned out to be a chocolate covered enchilada. Now normally I'd scoff at anyone eating chocolate covered savoury food, and probably top it off with some Rab C Nesbitt impressions, but this was one kick ass enchilada."
3,"In this area there are a lot of restaurants and Imbiss and it's really difficult to make a choice. From my experience, this is a good one. I've been here thrice and I always trieddifferent dishes and always left completely satisfied. It's not the cheapest place you can find, but probably one of the best in terms of quality. They've got a fixed menu for dinner and for lunch, one can order something from the latter at any time but in the evening it's slightly more expensive. I would recommend to try meat dishes, I still have to try fish but if you are into that there are probably a few better options in this area. Definitely try it, I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself wanting to come back after the first visit."
4,"This is a bloody big bridge. Looks great from a 10 euro boat trip, and you can probably see it even more cheaply if you take the ferry instead. Watching panamax container ships sail under here is awe-inspiring!"
3,"Super Konzept, meine Frau und ich gehen hier sehr gerne hin. Man bestellt das Essen (Pasta, Salat, Pizza) an verschiedenen Essensstationen, dann wird es 'live' und auf Bestellung zubereitet. Pasta ist immer frisch von der eigenen Pastamaschiene (man kann zukucken). Das Essen ist immer sehr gut und es gibt immer wieder Sondergerichte, die kreativ und lecker sind. Die allgemeine Atmosphäre ist immer lebhaft (nichts für ein intimes Essen zu zweit) und mann teilt sich die Tische mit anderen Gästen. Donnerstags ist es immer besonders voll. Einzigen Punktabszug gibt es für die manchmal langen wartezeiten an den Essensstationen - ist zwar nicht länger als man beim normalen REstaurant auf sein Essen warten würden, aber man steht hier eben selber an. Ausnahme ist hier die Pizzastation, wo man einen Buzzer bekommt und sich dann die Pizza abholt wenn sie fertig ist."
3,"Fun spot! Great views of the Hamburg Hafen and City. For the location and dress code the prices are reasonable. We had a lovely waitress and the drinks were perfectly mixed. A table may be hard to come by as this spot becomes more and more popular, so even on a Monday night it may be best to call ahead."
2,"Got much better since they cleared the view of the ships.Really, the main reason to be here is that next-door classic Strandperle is too crowded, again.Food is a little bit cheaper, but also less good. But that's not why you are down here.It's the view, the beer, the sun, the beach.Feels a tiny bit less professional than Strandperle, and that's a good thing too."
4,This is a tiny private restaurant tucked away on a side street. We picked it because is was close and it had good Yelp ratings. Seating is very tight and people may need to move tables to let you get to your seat. The diners were a mix of locals and European tourists. We were the only Americans. I had the krautspatzle and the others in our group had maultasche gebraten. I thought my  krautspatzle dish was excellent. It was very different from the brats we had been having for lunch. I tried some of my wife's dish and it too was very tasty. Portions were quite large and I could not finish all of my lunch. We would definitely return to this restaurant.
3,I had some of the best Calamari here that I have ever had.  The cocktails looked big and good. (A friend with me had a few of those).  I had two very large servings of that Bitte Hefe weissen which I really enjoyed.  The service was friendly and good.  They have a big board with the menu on it in German.  They will tell you what it is in English though if your German is not that good like mine. :)
4,"Hands down the best falafel in Hamburg. Freshly made, unlike par for the course at most Döner places, who just microwave something that resembles warm wet cardboard. Not only are the falafel fresh, but also perfectly made, crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. All the vegetarian salads and sides like tabbouleh and hummus are also good. If you dine-in- try either the Falafel or Mixed plate (5 Euros), served with a plate full of side dishes. If youre on the run, get the falafel in bread (2.50, ""spezial"" for 3 Euros with your choice of extra like eggplant)."
2,"We finally tried Jim Block after a year of living in Hamburg. The verdict? As the 3 stars indicate, it was ok--nothing more or less than what I expected I guess. Jim Block burgers are slightly better than McDonalds or Burger King in flavor, but are double in price. The bread used is that familiar super soft, highly processed looking bun that, frankly, isn't made to hold much in between them. This makes JB burgers a fork and knife kind of a meal. The burger patty looks mass-produced, was dry and highly seasoned, probably because of the lack of flavor in the actual meat. The fries tasted very much like McDonalds fries. Ketchup and mayo are 40 cents each and instead of serving the burger in a wrapper, it comes on a plate. I ordered the JB Champignon while my hubby ordered the JB BBQ. Both had good combinations of ingredients, but no matter what you put in it, you can hide that subpar meat. In conclusion, I can see the appeal, but I won't be coming back, at least not on my own volition."
3,"Kartoffelkeller was a great place to warm up after spending a cold day exploring Hamburg. Situated underground, there are cellar vibes that are offset with candles everywhere and cutesy decor. The menu is, unsurprisingly, potato heavy so there was plenty for a vegetarian to chose from. I ended up going either the potato soup, which was a welcome surprise because it was served in a small pot with a little candle underneath. We also went with potato pancakes as a starter. The pancakes were crispy and served with sweet jam that made them a better dessert than starter but they were great, none the less. The only reason my review is 4 stars and not 5 is that Kartoffelkeller was a bit expensive for having a potato heavy menu. Being flagged as touristy and in a tourist district that isn't too surprising but worth noting. Overall, I would certainly go again for the food and experience."
4,Kopiba is a really nice coffee shop at Neuer Pferdemarkt which we stumbled upon during a late evening (8pm) coffee hunt. The coffee is great and the couch at the far back is perfect for sinking into for a cuddle :) I'd love to come back here. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was lovely.
2,"It was Saturday and both having full blow hangovers and in need of some serious carbs, meat, grease and salt to soak up some of that seedy feeling we set out to find Jim block.My friend being from the US and eager to have a good burger something which he had not had since being in Hamburg. After 3 hours of trying to find it and a parking space in the very crowded centre of Hamburg we finally made it to our destination.I must admit I expected a little more from the burgers... huge in size yes and the service was quick and the place has a nice feel to it but other then that I can't say that the burgers were all that great. I personally feel the one I had at Hollywood canteen was much better... Still there are more burgers to try on the menu and maybe it was just the one I ordered and it definitely beats MacDonald's and even Hesburger which you all know I'm rather fond of after a night out."
1,"I'm a regular at this location, and today noticed a significant drop in the quality of the ingredients in my JB Caesar Burger. Think less Gourmet Burger, and now closer to McDonald's burger on a plate.Please disregard older reviews of this restaurant, as they are for a different higher quality menu."
4,Very good Mexican cuisine. Portions are large and the food is authentic! Definitely recommend it.
4,"I've been coming here for like 11 years now.Hands down the best Greek place in the world!The prices are very fair, all the waiters are very nice and there is always loads of ouzo ;) I have always been bringing new people here over the last decade and everyone always came back for more!If you are looking for awesome bifteki, nice gyros and tasty zaziki - this is the place to go!But always, if you wanna come here reserve a table in advance, this is one of the busiest places in Eimsbüttel!"
4,"Fantastic little restaurant!Great staff and food. We had a good time dining here. The restaurant doesn't have a menu but tells you the different food that day. There was no a problem making a vegetarian option for my friend, and they made fresh homemade pasta filled with pear. Never tried it before, but it was fantastic!The area outside (Hansaplatz) is a bit shady with people sitting outside drinking all day."
4,"This is an amazing dining experience, on a ship, water all around, good food. I was told in the summer they have live music on deck which should be even better. There was however jazz music downstairs in the pub, great band, great singing. I'll definitely be going back for the jazz!Awesome fact: My friend I was with is a naval engineer and he commented that this ship must be atleast 60 years old"
3,Nice selection of cocktails and Mexican dishes. 5 for 33EUR cocktail pack with a different set for guys and girls :) Also nice location to go around the town after dinner\ drinks. Wi-Fi didn't work on my Android phone - a simpler configuration could be better.
3,Good: Strong modern vietnamese dishes. Tasty and unique.Not so good: Portions ran on the medium-smaller side. We just had to order more.
2,"We ordered number 25 and 32. The sauce of number 25 was good and the nuggets were ok, but for 11 € it's overpriced and not worth it. The 32 dish was ok. When to skip this place: 1) If you are asian and used to asian food, skip this place. It's a classy germanized asian food 2) This might sound like the loving hut chain you think you know from the US. It's not! None of the dishes are the same. Just the name and logo looks the same 3) the service is not about making you feel welcomed or comfortable. It's about making sure you get your food lol. Feels very chaotic and rushed. Would I come again. Nope. Do I regret coming here. Nope, it's good to know that loving hut doesn't equal loving hut. It's not like McDonald's where you can expect to be able to order a Big Mac."
4,"If you're a fan of Willy Wonka and eating chocolate, then this is the place for you in Hamburg, Germany!   Upon entering the Chocoversum, you immediately notice a very handsome chocolate shop with plenty of room for gathering large groups before the tour.  I went with my family and we were able to get a group rate, which was good with several adults and children.  I highly advise scheduling a tour in advance, and if you need an English speaking guide, make sure to requests this well beforehand.  Tours here are generally conducted in German, so take note of this.  The tour begins with an amazing milk chocolate fountain.  It is literally about five feet tall and has spouts on the side where you can sample as much as you want with a wafer cookie.  From there you'll get a full explanation of the history and cultures of chocolate.  The different regions, countries, and continents that produce chocolate are fairly well represented with maps, and written materials. If you are a chocoholic, you will be jumping for joy as you enter the production room.  This is the place where you'll be able to make your own customized chocolate bar, complete with over a dozen toppings ranging from marshmallows to raisins and gummy bears!  Make sure to specify whether you'd like to make a milk or dark chocolate bar, as the tour guide will pour a fresh one in a mold for you.  After you've made your own chocolate bar, you'll then proceed to additional displays of how the actual chocolate is made, along with a variety of machines involved in process.  The offer a couple of additional samples for tasting from the machines and end with a small package piece you can take home with you. As you exit the tour, you'll enter in the showroom with plenty of options to buy souvenirs, gifts, and additional chocolates.  Enjoy!"
2,"Touristy, of course at this location. The menus were just kind of thrown on the table and the waiter walked away. He was very busy. Music playing so softly I couldn't even make out what kind of music was playing. Quite without atmosphere, this restaurant.Food was served quickly and tasted good. The waiter didn't come to check on us at any time though.Toilets not very clean, not dirty.. Something in the kitchen he middle. Free WiFi. I think that it's a good place to have a quick bite for a fair price close to the docks. Defiantly not a romantic place for a date!"
4,"Love this place! Such a great and friendly atmosphere - the waiters and owner make you feel welcome! Be sure to reserve seats, it's a small place and very popular. There is no menu, everyone gets the 4-course Spanish/Portugese meal (suitable to you if you are vegetarian, for ex). Live music from a singer/guitarist included (loud then, otherwise ok). A fun time!"
3,Cute restaurant with a great ambiance. Feels like it is lit by candles making it warm and welcoming. Get the potato pancakes!
4,"Perfekt! Essen, Preis-Leistung, Ambiente  eine echte Bereicherung für Hoheluft."
3,Trendy & HotYoung & creative crowdDelicious & cheapGut & Günstig Perfect for friends gathering and burger sharing. Healthy salads for ladies are adding a good asset of choice
4,"Classy, great seafood. Really good restaurant serving some fish specialities from Hamburg."
4,"Wow, tolles Essen! Sehr interessante Einrichtung. Nette Bedienung. Wir sind rundum glücklich :) Mittagstisch um die 10EUR und wahnsinns gute Qualität!"
3,"In German, 'kekse' sounds like 'cakes' but really means cookies, so when I first walked past the happykappy--a store clearly specializing in cupcakes--well, I just had to try. I'll bet they are really just muffins disguised as cupcakes, I mumbled to The Mexican as we ducked inside. No, no oh no. They where, in fact, the real-deal. Perhaps overly-sweet for the typical German pallet, these babies are pure pastry porn: big on size, taste and a bit on price. But hey, this is not the corner Bäckerei--unless your corner baker is Lewis Carroll. If you never had a cupcake, this is where you go in Hamburg to try one. If your alcoholic friend is throwing a dinner party, a box of cupcakes makes a good backup to the gift of wine. And if your girlfriend is a sex-in-the-city nut: consider the seduction factor of these cupcakes: beautiful, edible fashion."
2,"I went there last week and i had the filet. To be totally honest its good but its not GOOD.It's average, unlike other comments i cant say its the best steak I've had nor that's it the best steak in hamburg And maybe they changed the cook since aLii's comment but my medium rare was not rare at all, it was actually almost well done. It was a hard piece of steak.But it's averagely priced, for 18EUR you get a salad and fries or baked potato which is ok! I also had their Bocktail vodka with russian berry! That was absolutely berry delicious :)"
4,Perfekt und sehr lecker!
4,Can't really say enough about this place. Locally sourced carvery meat and home made potatoes and knodel. Very simple concept and reasonably priced. Very impressed with the quality and the service. A short walk from Messberg station.
3,"Fantastic location and view, great drinks and  friendly staff. Go here on a weekday to skip the que and have more space. Viel Spaß!"
3,"Yummy burgers, good fries, nice staff OK prices. I like it here :)"
2,"Nice and warm and filled with manily uni students this is a great little place for lunch as it's near the Uni, cheap, fast and effective. Their soup and bread is yummy, filling and a bargin. There's plenty of other things on the menu if soup isn't your thing, pizza, bagels, pasta etc... the coffee is drinkable too."
4,"Very flavorful kebab and rice! The soultani is well cooked, overall well done but still very moist. Served with mint and onions, as well as flatbread. Very reasonably priced about 14.50 euros for soultani, about 2.80 for each drink. Served very fast! Good Persian music playing in the background and elegantly decorated."
3,"Good burgers, but nothing special. The fried were nice as well. Overall, I'd recommend it to watch some sports."
2,"A slightly underwhelming experience for my birthday dinner. This restaurant is very close to my apartment and I was very much looking forward to being able to go there often.The amuse-bouche was amazing: A garlic soup (velouté) which tasted absolutely divine. The taste of garlic, while definitely present, was mild and enjoyable. I'm glad it came only in small espresso cups because it felt very rich.The appetizer (veal pâté with a gorgonzola mousse) was also very good. The gorgonzola mousse on top of arugula was really tasty. The pâté had also good taste but I wished that it was a little bit richer. It felt a little bit dry, but this is probably normal when you consider that it's not pork-based pâté. Also strange was that my course was served without bread.The main course is where the disappointment happened. Both my wife and I had the cod served with spinach and seafood cannelloni. The skin of the fish wasn't crispy and the spinach was underwhelming. But worst of all were the two seafood cannelloni. Whoever made these should not be allowed to cook pasta again, it was really tough and I ended up leaving on the plate. Same with my wife and my neighbor at a different table. Overall this dish had potential but the execution was poor.Service was incredibly slow. The three first courses arrived at a good pace, not fast but it left time for us to enjoy the food, wine and conversation. But once we received our main courses, the waiters just seemed to disappear. We waited so long that in the end we decided to bypass the dessert and head home, because we didn't want to wait any longer. In the end, 3 courses took more than 2 hours."
3,"Really nice and cozy pub in the center of Hamburg. I enjoyed here a dinner after a soccer match...and it was kind of ""rejuvenating"". Nice beers and nice burgers.I took the Eva's: chicken breast, bacon and salad with fried potatoes. Really nice, good size and just 8€. Everything well cooked and the overall taste was well balanced.I really loved the internals, wooden table and chairs, rhe candles and the dark atmosphere!"
2,We went here due to the yelp reviews. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as expected. The food was only ok and the waitress didn't speak German or English. With a lot of pointing at the menu we got the food we wanted. I guess that during the week there is more staff and the food is better.
3,Best ice cream/gelato I've had yet in Hamburg. Very creamy and smooth. I had one scoop of After Eight and one of hazelnut. I wish the After Eight was mintier but both tasted like mint and hazelnuts. The chocolate and nut cone left something to be desired - it was stale. I'd say stick with a cup and you should have a 5 star experience!
4,"This is the COOLEST museum/exhibit that I have EVER SEEN!  When you think you are going to visit a tiny recreation of the world via trains...it is even better and bigger than that.  I mean, this guy and his team have thought of everything!!!  The lights go down for nighttime and the sceneries interact with you/change depending on the time of day, etc.  It is so hard to explain the magic of this place.  There are generally lines but so worth the wait.  Block off some time for this one.  This is not a place you want to pop in a run through.  The details are crazy cool and necessitate a lengthier visit.  I wish I could go back and share this with so many of my friends and family members but it is sooo far away for me.  If you are reading this and considering a visit, do it!  You will not be disappointed, but rather left in awe by the creativeness of it all."
2,"I wasn't really impressed with this place. I figured I had to get a burger if I was going to be in Hamburg, but the meat lacked seasoning, all the fresh ingredients were cold and the cheese wasn't melted. These are some of the most important parts about a good burger. Also, they don't accept American credit cards so make sure you have cash. (I walked around for awhile looking for an ATM, that was fine!) The truffle mayo sauce is good and the ketchup is regular ketchup. The ""large"" fizzy water was pretty small in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend. I went in on a Sunday around 8:00 and sat right away since I was by myself. Service was pretty quick."
2,"Der typische Grieche um die Ecke, gut wenn man gerade hungrig aus der U-Bahn stolpert, das Essen ist gut, Service freundlich, trotzdem nur drei Sterne da ich die Preise als zu hoch empfinde und mich die Raucher-Liga, die ständig den Eingang blockiert und einem in's Ohr grölt, mir echt auf den Senkel geht. Sogar, wenn ich gar nicht zum Essen dort bin, sondern nur auf dem Weg von der Bahn dort vorbeimuß.Aus dem Grunde würde ich mich auch ums verrecken nicht im Sommer draußen hinsetzen wollen. Da hat das Ganze eher das feeling der Altherrenkneipe umme Egge. Nicht mein Ding."
4,"If you go to Hamburg, even without your kids, you must go visit this place. It is fantastic! But go there late in the evening or very early in the morning - else there will be to many tourists.Expect to use minimum 2 hours there, even though you do not think a mini-world is anything for you, this place is a must see."
4,"This is exactly what a neighbourhood Italian restaurant should be. On a quiet street you enter down short steps into a small bustling eating area. We turned up unannounced lateish on a Tuesday evening. The Trattoria was full but we were all made welcome with glasses of prosecco while we waited. And it was worth the wait. Deciding to go with tradition, I had the Ossobucco, which was just as rich and flavoursome as I had hoped. Other traditional dishes taken included Linguine Vongole etc - all apparently also fully enjoyed. Highly recommended for small groups, friends and romantic meals."
3,"I usually avoid American spots when traveling abroad, but German cuisine isn't particularly spectacular that I felt like I was missing out on the local experience (I could make a killing opening up a spice shop here). Plus, like everyone else said, eating a hamburger in Hamburg is probably one of those bucket list type of things.The decor is... interesting. It seems a little all over the place. Definitely American-inspired but with random Tex-Mex thrown in. Pretty loud space but open enough that you can hear the folks at your table. I highly recommend getting a reservation. We showed up with a group of 5 on Thursday night at 7pm and found ourselves having to wait at the bar for about 30 minutes before a table opened up. That said, the wait staff is very accommodating and will try to figure something out for you.Food-wise, pretty solid. I had the Bronx Jon medium-rare. I'm a fan of the English-muffins-for-buns approach. It's enough bread to hold the burger without giving you an immediate carb hangover. Temperatures seem to err on the higher end of the spectrum (most other burgers at the table were over). For what it's worth, the Bronx Jon isn't ridiculously greasy. All burgers come with enough fries to feed a small army.Nota bene: they only take cash."
3,"I like this place a lot. We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon not knowing quite what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised. It seems new, the staff is nice, and the food is good.The floor plan is a bit odd... the entrance is alongside the pizza kitchen, with a huge countertop and a giant red oven. Towards the back up a short flight of stairs is the dining room, which probably seats about 40 or 50 people, and is decorated in a minimalist, trendy way with plants growing in gutters along a side wall.The menu is mostly pizza, along with a few appetizers and a few salad options. They also have a pizza-based dessert which is chocolate raviolis made with pizza dough. We didn't try dessert on our first visit, but it will probably happen at some point. There is also a surprisingly long drink menu; everything from coffee and tea to beer and wine, and cocktails to boot.I ordered the special pizza, which was fennel sausage, roasted red pepper strips, and shaved parmesan. My wife had the portobello pizza, which has ricotta instead of tomato sauce, and is topped with mushrooms and truffle oil. Both were delicious and filling. There's a lot of advertising around to tell you this, but these are meant to be Neapolitan-style pizzas which are baked in a 400C oven for 90 seconds. As a result, the pizzas come out mostly cooked, but still a little watery, and the crust never gets terribly crisp. (I don't mind, but apparently this bothers other Yelpers.)In the ""How is it for kids?"" department, our daughter was greeted with a coloring book and a jar full of colored pencils, and when it came time to ordering, we were able to get her a smaller kinder-pizza withOUT (this is the most important part) any green seasoning (oregano) whatsoever. They are very accommodating of picky kids.I liked the vibe a lot, and the food was good. I'll definitely be back."
3,This is a nice plate for a quick bite to eat. You can feel a bit rushed when it's crowded with several people waiting in line. The food is pretty good and healthy . I usually get a salad or sandwich which is prepared for everyday consumption. Most of the items in the fridge have dates on it so you'll know when it was lasted prepared for eating.
1,"I came here a few weeks ago on a Friday around 7PM with my wife. We found a seat outside and waited 30 minutes to order, then another 40 minutes for our food arrive. The burger was pretty good and really tasty, but it's such a disappointment after waiting for so long. They definitely need more servers and more organization around how you order.We've been to their old location and really anticipated something better here, but it seems like they are still working out the problems in their new location. I'll give them another try in the future, but be wary if you show up hungry."
1,We were really disappointed by this place. The cheese on my cheeseburger was simply burned (like totally black...) and when we said something about it they said that it is supposed to be crunchy... okee this was NOT crunchy but burned. Eventually I got a new one which was better (as in the cheese wasn't burned)Both our burgers were not very special or really good. I would not recommand going here for hamburgers.The drinks were good so maybe this place is better as a bar
2,Very big and quite impressive but once you've seen one section you've pretty much seen it all.
2,The food is good.. but it takes too long to get the food .  Don't go there too hungry! You might start pulling your hair
0,"The food might be ok, but the waitress / unbelievable unfriendly and rude. We had to go to the front to get the menu and clear our own table. Horrible!"
2,"The 20 UP is located in a Hotel in the St Pauli district. It is of course known for its breathtaking views of the city. However that is about it. The service is horrible, the drinks are watered down, and it is rather small. And because it has become even more popular with tourist so it is filled to the brim with them.In my opinion, go there once, keep your coat on, walk over to the window, take a few pictures and enjoy the view and then get the hell out of there. You'll thank me later."
3,"I happened across this place the other night after coming out of a flat viewing. I have to say the outside looks a bit circumspect, but I noticed that every table outside was taken, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. We sat by a window table inside instead, which was actually as good as being outside but not as cold, and had the filet steak, and a (forgive my spelling) schnitzel. The food wasn't bad at all, the service was great, and the beer was nice too. So all in all, it's not bad! (forgot to mention - apparently they have DJs on here too - but don't know what they're like!)"
4,"Monday night at 8:30 is free jazz auf dem Feuerschiff! A short and scenic walk along the harbor then, ""all aboard!"" The boat stays stationary so you don't have to worry about not wanting to stay all evening or in case you are prone to getting seasick. You are free to come and go as you please. Jazz music is played below deck where there is also a bar with some seating and a number of tables for dining as well. Fun atmosphere, good times, and good music."
3,Don't know much about sushi. But at least that one was the best i've ever had. I recommend the beef topping.
4,New look! Great party location. Music for every taste. Friendly staff and an interesting mix of people. Challenge the bartender and order a cockail!Toilettes: Clean & surprisingly cool. (at least b4 12 o'clock)
4,"Original koreanisches essen, wirklich sehr gut! Auch das sushi ist zu empfehlen. Also nicht von der betagten Einrichtung abschrecken lassen, das essen ist klasse."
4,"Just wow... A must see and well really the only main attraction found in Hamburg. It might appear childish at first, but its far from, its a historical masterpiece. Whether you'd like to reminisce over your childhood modeling years, or your world wanderer this exhibition of tiny animated models will take you back. Outside of your personal experience, this would positively impact your child's imagination offering mechanical and historical significance. Prepare for a 3-4 hour visit, there is so much content I'd advise review it in detail. In any case you will miss something. Great for English speaking visitors, and German natives."
2,"It is kind of sad that in a city like Hamburg, where so many restaurants and shops offer fish, it seems to be impossible to get some really good fish and chips.Henssler is no exception.I can not say anything about any of the dishes you can get inside the restaurant. I just wanted fish and chips to take away. And it wasn't bad. But that is all. And from a name like Henssler, one would expect a bit more.Maybe Hamburg simply isn't the place for a simple portion of fish and chips. If you really want that, wait till you get to Travemünde for example. Had fish and chips in a small and extremely simple restaurant in the port of Travemünde and was surprised by the way better quality than that of Henssler at a lower price."
4,"This restaurant is AMAZING.  Visiting Hamburg on vacation from the states and we couldn't have chosen a better spot. This restaurant was a 5 min walk from our apartment in the quaint neighborhood of St George.  Inside, the atmosphere/decor carries the charm and history of Hamburg that we were seeking in a true German experience.  We cannot sing the praises of our server, Lokman (or Baran as he is known there), enough.  He was wonderfully charming and accommodating to our ""american-ness"". He patiently lead us through the menu and engaged in entertaining, witty conversation Now for our food.  OUR FOOD.  Every bite was amazing!   Our party had everything from the ""summerly radishes soup"" to my dish, ""Our Pfundskerl"" (meatball with asparagus and noodles)   Everything was exceptional.  Each mouthwatering dish was flavorful and melted in your mouthWe cannot speak highly enough of our experience at Das Dorf"
3,"Carrywurst, beer result in philosophical reflections), matchless Ceazar salat!"
2,"Pretty good curry for a shopping centre, but it's definitely not the curry mile of Manchester. Chutney has a slightly limited choice of around 4-5 dishes, and you queue up to buy it and then sit on stools. Quick, but not really comfy. They say you have to buy a large meal if you want to eat in, but in fact, you can get a small and just sit down anyway. The curry is at least on a par with Shalimar but for loads less cash, and slightly less grand surroundings!"
4,I was expecting to drop by for an hour or two during my visit to Hamburg.  My wife and I ended up staying over 5 hours.  And although I felt the enterance fee of 13 euros was high before I went in after I toured the attraction I didn't feel that way at all.This is the best thing to do in Hamburg hands down.  2nd isn't even close.  I'm now a mega Minatur-Wunderland fan.
4,"I never thought I would be a fan of the currywurst..unless it is at 4am in the morning after a big night out where anything would taste good!! However, Curry Grindel has completely changed my viewand my tastebuds! They are brilliant and the chips are great tooand to think that this place is just at the end of my street! Great place for a quick snack and if you ever have visitors to Germany.this is the place to introduce them to the currwurst!"
0,"They really didn't want to serve us, so we left.  They simply would not acknowledge our presence and when we asked they said they don't speak English well and they were too busy and did not have much food left.  Americans before us must have left them with a bad taste.  So, if you do not speak German well, maybe avoid this one."
4,"We were visiting Hamburg for the day and found this coffee shop / cafe on Yelp. What a find!  It reminded me of the fabulous shops in San Francisco. Great hip, minimalist decor. The coffee and food was amazing!  I had a latte that was delicious and hit the spot since we were exploring in the rain. Their breakfast menu was small but fabulous. The staff was helpful and spoke English...yay. We ordered 3 different things--waffle with fruit and mascarpone (so good), poached eggs with avocado, and scrambled eggs with a delish cheese spread for toasted bread.  Everything was fabulous!  Definitely worth a stop!"
3,"Almost one of ""must-visits"" in HH due to very central location, nice schnitzels and great beer."
0,Food is bland and service was worst. Very rude servers (young and old)!!! They all seemed pissed off that there's people in the restaurant! Never-ever again even if I'm starving and it's next to the hotel!
2,"Being used to award-winning burgers back in the States, I was hoping that Billy the Butcher would satisfy a month-long burger craving since I moved here. I ended up walking away satisfied, but not blown away. I ordered their maxed out burger, which came with bacon, sautéed onions, and a fried egg. The ingredients were high quality, and the burger was topped with a tasty, albeit too sweet burger sauce. The meat itself was on the bland side, and lacked a proper seasoning. Fries (a separate order, as the burger only comes by itself) were a refreshing mix of about 2/3 regular, and 1/3 sweet potato fries, and came topped with a rosemary based seasoning that was original. For a 13-14 euro lunch meal, it could have been better."
4,"A very good place for fresh see food such as lobster, scampi, service is quite good as well because they offer kids the color pencils for drawing during waiting for food."
3,"There aren't too many wine bars around Hamburg, but the Südhang is one. It's pretty hidden while at the same time being in the middle of the Schanze. You have to walk 5m off the main road towards the entrance to the wine shop, then enter the wine shop, and then go up the stairs. The menu isn't extensive, consisting mostly of pasta and salad dishes, but there should also be a few bigger meals advertised on teh blackboard. I had a pleasant time there last night. I'll probably be back."
4,"Parlament is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in the basement of the equally beautiful town hall building in Hamburg. The restaurant is dark and romantic, with amazing architectural details, commanding furniture, candlelit tables, and a gorgeous, illuminated full bar in the center of the enormous room. I came here with two friends from Hamburg who speak German as their native language and were able to request an easy-to-read English menu for me. Parliament has a liquor menu but I opted for just still water, saving my calories for the delicious food. I opted for currywurst which is made with lamb and dressed in a rich, brown, curry-laden sauce and served with a generous side of thick, fresh steak fries. My dinnermates ordered the same and we were brought a pot of mayonnaise for dipping our fries (though this is obviously quite standard in Hamburg, it is not something we do in America and though foreign to me, I totally got on board with mayo as a condiment for fries and ended up enjoying it on more than one occasion). The service was as expected in Germany - never cloying, well-paced, and unrushed. This would be a fantastic place to bring a date or to enjoy a leisurely dinner with friends."
3,"A very cool concept for good food in a really great location but with a slightly fast food twist. Va piano promises a great social location with great pizza and pasta to choose from, made freshly in front of you. My friend had the tortollini pesto pasta which was really well presented and tasted excellent. I had the calzone pizza which by nature took longer to cook yet was well worth the wait. This was one of the nicest calzone pizzas I have had in my life. A great chain with a great idea, if you are I'm the area stop looking for other places right now."
4,Owner was super friendly and gave us tons of tips about the best way of cooking the meat. The amount of food was really satisfying and as taste as it goes. We will definitely come back.
4,After a truly grueling day we came here as a group of 8. Everyone left with content smiles. Perfect wait staff and excellent food. Love this place!!!!
3,"No, not like Duff Beer, it's Dulf's Burger! This joint serves up some amazing meat between buns utilizing a high tech ordering system that you will have to experience yourself. It'll be one of those times where you just wish every restaurant had this system that just makes things easier.I went big with my burger and ordered a special that had everything. I'm talking fried egg, avocado, etc. While it was damn delicious (see the cross section photo I posted), I sort of wish I just went with a straight up cheeseburger to bask in the glory of simple hamburger in Hamburg. The onion rings were good, but I think I would rather have went with the fries.I do think Burgerlich is better than Dulf's, but both are real good in their own ways. Check out both of them while you're in town!"
4,"Classic Greek! No major decorations, no shi-shi people, just quality food and heartfelt service. It's not often you go into a restaurant where a bunch of people hug the owner before leaving. I am sure these are the regulars but nice to see. This also isn't gourmet cooking. Its basic Greek food prepared really well. If you're looking for something fancy go elsewhere. There is both indoor and outdoor seating with a small bar right past the entrance. The menu is what you'd expect. There is a nice selection of wines and other drinks. Although I wouldn't remove any stars for this, there isn't necessarily a lot of parking in the area so you're better off biking it or taking public transport."
3,"2 Euro party! This photo both takes the most fantastic pics for 2 Euros! Great way to start or end a party, either way you gonna look awesome. One down side, it's a dirty place!"
4,"What a great little bar. Easy going, great music, live music, poetry, nice staff. Now hidden behind the new road."
4,"Unglaublich gute Sushi, sogar das vegetarische Sushi mit den 3-4 Stücken tempura-Gemüse finde ich zum niederknien (in anderen Restaurants sind das oft nur Gurkenmaki, die man am liebsten vergessen möchte) Vorweg gab es eine ganz schlicht aussehende gemüsebrühe mit lachsstückchen. Selbst die war ein Gedicht. Mein neuer lieblingsasiate."
2,"Can't claim to be from SoCal, but I know a good Burrito when I taste one and this steak burrito almost ticked the boxes. I was looking for taste and chilli zing and I got everything I was looking for. Would have liked to have seen some authentic sauces to add to the heat, but they use that Chinese Sriracha stuff, you know with the yellow stopper. No matter, it did the job well. Later discovered some Lol Tun Habanero sauce which I applied liberally.Thrash Metal on the stereo which didn't make for a restful experience, but hey, the Schanze is not made for rest even at 1pm! But the other mainly younger crowd seemed to be grooving to it! The guys who run this place are obviously big metal fans, one wall is covered with pics of men in gimp masks. Either that, or along with the hard seating, it's an effective device to keep the customers moving and discourage lingerers.If I was to be critical, I would highlight their steak cooking process, which seemed not be via a grill, more like  steamed steak! Were I to return, I'd choose another filling and perhaps take some earplugs along.Sorry but it has to be three stars."
3,"This place is absolutely delish!! Im very picky w buffet restaurants.. this place has ""superb"" quality meats, fish, and veggies. They have to roll us out of here eventually  btw the restaurant is huge and interior design is modern and white. Very nice!"
4,"It's exactly the kind of place that you expect when you're looking for a cosy, crammed and delicious Italian restaurant. This place has great lunch deals.Make sure you make a reservation when you want to go there on a Saturday evening."
2,"(M)eatery is a drop in the recent flood of upper class steak houses that has beleaguered the Hamburg food scene recently. That said, word-of-mouth had been rather positive, so I prepared my inner carnivore for a feast. Interior design is, of course, a matter of personal taste, but (M)eatery's rather cool interior rather didn't appeal to mine. Service was swift and friendly, so a (M)eatery Deluxe Burger was ordered quickly. The burger was explained at length in the menu as a very elaborate and distinguished piece of meaty cuisine, so my expectations were rather high. For a price of EUR 18 one gets a beef burger with shallots, home made chips and Wasabi mayonnaise. One even has the choice of different kinds of rolls. Regrettably, what came out of the kitchen didn't warrant the rather lengthy and somewhat pretentious explanation in the menu. First of all my burger had been cooked very medium instead of medium rare (as I'd ordered it); the Wasabi mayonnaise is plain silly, as its very dominant taste simply doesn't suit this kind of dish. But worst of all were the chips, which were very soggy and fatty indeed. Still feeling a bit hungry I, somewhat cynically, ordered soufflé for desert, wondering if the kitchen could actually handle such a delicate dish. Alas, I should have known better: the soufflé was served far to quickly to have been made properly, so what I got in the end was a decent, but uninspiring mixture of a cake and flan. Would I visit Meatery (already fed up with the spelling) again? If I was invited, probably yes, but not for my own money. I guess the search for Hamburg's No.1 steakhouse continues."
4,"Most favorite Italian in Hamburg. Try the Vitello Tonnato- amazing, and the pizza's are delicious! When the meal is coming to an end- be ready for a couple bottles and shot glasses to appear at your table with a friendly smile... The owners/servers know how to party and love making you feel like you're in their own home!"
1,"Leider nicht so gut. Das Essen lag eher auf dem Niveau des Lieblingsvereins des hier ansässigen Fanclubs  gerade noch zweitklassig. Zum Mittagstisch hatte ich Gyros in Metaxasauce für 6 Euro. Die Menge war in Ordnung, der Geschmack der Sauce ok, wenn auch nicht an Metaxa erinnernd. Das Fleisch war aber kaum genießbar  knorpelig, hart, überwürzt und trocken. Ich hatte den Eindruck, als wäre es vorgegart und wieder aufgewärmt worden."
4,"The best baked potato I have eaten. Ever. In my life. And it was cheap too. If i remember correctly it cost something like 3.90 EUR. I highly recommend it to everyone, including people who like me, normally do not like baked potatoes. Me and my friends liked it so much that we went there 3 times in two days!"
3,"Having no prior knowledge of this place, therefore no preconceived ideas, I'd say it was delightful.  A nice glass of wine with an Alsacian onion tart and I was one happy gal.   A pleasant enough place with decent service and a comfortable atmosphere."
2,"Having now been here a couple of times I thought it was time to write a review. I personally like this place in regards to location and ambiance. I prefer sitting outside in the warmer months and having a glass of wine or coffee. It's kind of a place to go for a quick stop. In the winter, I find the interior really tight when the restaurant is full but it's stylish. Others have written this already but don't go here if you're not into the gliterrati of Eppendorf hanging out. I can easily ignore them and find them entertaining, albeit oftentimes too loud. Everyone wants to be ""most important"". Whatever, these are all trust-fund babies or advertising drones and they never change wherever you are.The food is mediocre at best but there are some highlights. The place is not consistent which is probably the biggest complaint about their food. The prices are also steep for what you get. I recently had a seafood mix which was I believe 21 Euro. It was horribly small in regards to portion size and was bearable. I've had so much better seafood in my life. The mussels in the dish were the smallest I've seen in a long time. The fish was also off somehow.....I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that threw it off. On the other hand, my g/f was impressed with her penne dish and we both do regularly get the Caesar salad, which actually is more like a chicken-teriyaki salad. Oh well, this is Mars Bar. It's usually like this and you go here knowing what you're going to get. At least the crowd is consistent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's a fun place to ""stop in"" if you're in the area or live nearby as I do. It's definitely not a destination restaurant where you make an effort to go out of your way and reserve a table. Of course, if you want to show off your Porsche, Ferrari, or Lambo, you can park it right out front and there are a lot of windows so that everyone WILL see that it's you. If you feel ignored, rev the engine a couple times......it's usually loud inside."
4,"My boyfriend and I are in Hamburg for just a day and we decided to stop here based on the excellent reviews(though only few). You must keep the restaurants appearances out of your impression because the food and the hospitality of the staff make this five star worthy! I had the Wiener schnitzel, which was very flavorful and a huge serving! My boyfriend ate the curry wurst which was also excellent. If we were staying in Hamburg longer we would definitely make another trip here!"
2,"they were a bit overwhelmed although it was empty, the coffee was OK and the strawberry cake didn't have too much flavour. There WiFi was out, so maybe I just picked the wrong day. The staff was friendly, but not very chatty when I was asking for directions or something to see before I was flying out again."
4,Schnitzel was very tender and buttery. Falafel was full a flavor   Service was prompt and friendly
2,"1. homeless could come in to beg for food while you are eating ( so environment is bad) 2. food quality --- bad ( I'm Asian, so maybe I'm too strict on the taste.) 3. cheap --- so I still go there from time to time. When it get better, I will reverse my review :)"
3,"Good value for money.Decoration looks very authentic India-like, though the place could be cleanerRecommend it"
4,"One of my 'locals' anytime of the year. As a non-meat eater, I can't comment on the 'Haxe' or even the fish, but the appetizers are great, and never cease to satisfy. With a bottle of retsina and an ouzo or two, a meal at Nostalgia is always worthwhile."
1,"This place was quite an unpleasant surprise. Although we had passed by it often, living quite nearby, we hadn't tried it out. On a sunny day, we saw seats outside and decided to try it out for lunch. We had some wine, a pizza and noodles with gorgonzola and bacon. First and foremost, the prices here are a joke. I live in the area so I know it's not cheap around here. At the same time, the prices here are higher than everywhere around and the portions are smaller. The pizza is a decent size but they forgot one of the ingredients. Further, it was thin-crust but mushy and wet. Nothing crunchy or appealing about this dish. The noodles were bland and I think I counted about 15 pieces (in total) of penne. This as a main course and for something like 12 Euros. The pizza for somewhere in the vicinity of 15 Euro for the ""large"" was ridiculous. The wine, also not cheap, was OK but nothing more. Finally, service was a joke. Slow is an understatement. Disinterested and unprofessional fits the bill.So, why two stars? Well, I really like the decor inside. It is well styled. Further, it's a nice location and if you are only coming in for a couple glasses of wine, fine. I'll give them two stars for deco and location. Otherwise, everything else is a joke.Finally, you better like snobs. The place is usually full of your usual Eppendorfer clowns. Pinks, greens, animal prints, silicon lips, LV bags and so forth. I can usually drown them out and mostly find them amusing decoration for a place. They entertain me well but I know enough people who would gag at their sight and here you don't have to wait long for the ""show"" to begin."
4,"If you don't mind that it's quite packed, you'll love the place. The food is excellent and there's a wide choice, the atmosphere is very cozy, and the prices are not too high."
4,"What a lovely place. Feels like ""Little Italy"" in Hamburg.Coffee, sandwiches, baguetts and other small things makes the time there timeless.Fantastic place to relax, enjoy and chill Clear recommendation!!"
3,"A great place for a get-together.  The atmosphere is inviting, buzzing;  the lighting, the sparking glassware here, the stacked bottles there,  the open table seating with little nooks here and there - - it is a great place to be.  The drawback being, that it gets loud.The food is on one page at the back of a massive drinks menu, but the quality shines.   The salads were big and beautiful,  and the flammkuchen with crème fraîche, spring onions, speck, and pfifferlinge was perfect - - beautiful balance of ingredients, satisfying creamy base, and just delicious.The wines were OK.  The recommended red from our stellar server opened up nicely over time.  My two whites had character, but were nothing I'd buy in.    The staff were knock-out attentive, gracious, and capable.   The were super busy, but always responsive."
4,"Great place also for vegetarians! Nice people, very good and friendly service. Try the zucchini bratlinge! Love them."
4,"I've walked past this place at lunch time, and there's always a line out the door. I finally tried it today, and wow!! Excellent tasting ice cream. Very very fresh. You should go here if you're in the area and looking for dessert!"
3,"Super casual atmosphere and reasonable prices. I had seen the pictures of the ""Lumper Jack"" burger and just had to try it. The level of service was in top (and in English!) however, they forgot the jalapenos in my burger even tho i asked for it. The food came very soon after I'd ordered.The bun was soft and very sweet - just as it should be. The burger had soft onions, double patties with double cheese and bbq sauce. Great combo. Very tasty burger and it tasted  homemade for each bite. The fries had peel on them which is delicious but I doubt they were homemade. The dippings were def. non-homemade. If the fries had been homemade roughly cut steak fries with homemade mayo we could have achieved the last star.Overall still a great experience and I'll surely come back if I have the chance."
0,"Never go to this place! It's seedy and very unfriendly. Not to mention that the meat is unhealthy. First I couldn't understand why they got so many positive reviews but then I realized that it is owned by a turkish organization that supports Erdogan and some strange (terror?) groups, which, on the other hand, support them by giving positive reviews."
3,"Had a very relaxing evening there. The service was professional and friendly. The wines that I tried an the drinks my friend had were all good. The munchies were very good (sweet potatoe fries and a flamkuchen). When the weather turns wet or colder, the inside is spacious and well designed. It's next to a museum and not in a very scenic area of Hamburg (of which there many...). But still very nice. I highly recommend it."
2,"De vraies crepes, incroyable!++* Food: the only reason you want to go there is to eat those dark buckwheat flour 'galettes', which are much healthier and filling than than their crepes counterparts (served for dessert). The latter can be found in any street corner/mall, etc...The chocolate flambee one is a show by itself!* Atmosphere: you want to go there with a bunch of friends to enjoy a bottle of cider. Decoration is refreshing ! The ""Bretagne"" feeling is definitely there. Waiters wear those marine stripped shirts, Jean Paul Gaultier? I don't think so, they have a connected shop within the restaurant where you can buy those shirts. Sweet anyway...* Location: Deichstrasse is one of the few streets Hamburg which doesn't make my eyes bleed. There are other restaurants I'll visit soon or later.Staff: quite friendly & many French, good signs? Locals tend to think so ;)--The place probably lives on its glory time, now that it is quite famous in town it can afford to be less flexible. Case in point: I had an egg galette which came literally with 1 egg on top (really people !?) but then it ""only"" costs 4,1eur. The chicken one is prepared in mustard instead of having the chicken prepared and get the mustard extra/aside... I only see a trick here to keep unsold meat for an extra day in the fridge ( pretty wrong in my opinion)The only place in town for a true galette so go for the refreshing experience!However when everything comes in sugar, cheese or covered in questionable dressing and there is almost no room to adjust the toppings, I doubt that I'll be a regularThey need a serious competitor to wake them up, anyone ?"
2,"I've had lunch here a few times and to be honest it is not my cup of tea. It is a cool place to have lunch, considering you are eating inside the Rathaus. The food is not horrible but it wasn't memorable in a good way either. I had the Currywurst last time and the sauce was horrible. The texture was like sand, it was bitter, not spicy in least, and plain just tasted bad. The fries were also a bit bland which is surprising since they are fries. I mean how hard is it to screw up fries? The other times I have been here it was for a ""party"". They cleared out the entire place and changed it into a club. They always seemed to have great DJs at those events as well. The price is not the cheapest by any means so bring your money and lots of it."
4,"No printed menu that I ever saw. A blackboard that looks to be updated daily on the wall. I took the waiters recommendation for what to have. Antipasti to share, secondi of pasta with truffles and entree of fresh grilled sea bass that he promised he would bone out. Really good. Never would have ordered that without his recommendation. My dining companion had homemade ravioli topped with white truffles. He was very happy. Good service that moved along but didn't feel rushed. Very reasonable prices for what we had. Under 100€ for two with three courses and drinks. This is a very small but popular dining place. It might be hard to sit and talk and just drink.  But there are other choices near by for that. Just dine here first!"
4,"Miniatur Wunderland markets itself as the world's largest model train exhibit, but it's a lot more than that. This place is incredible; all of the hype is absolutely justified.I don't want to spoil the experience for you (exactly the same words my coworker told me when she recommended Miniatur Wunderland, which I now completely understand), so I'll just give you a few tips for ensuring a great experience:1. You can and should make a reservation online before you visit. It's a little weird because you don't actually need to pay for this reservation; it's just some kind of ticketing system to control flow.2. If you're visiting on a weekend or a holiday, plan to go as early as possible, like between 8:30-9:30am. The place starts filling up with visitors around 10am and the experience is way better when it's empty and you have the place to yourself.3. The entrance is on the 2nd floor and there are lockers available for stowing your backpacks (1euro deposit). Take the elevator to the 3rd or 4th floors where the exhibits are. I was really concerned about ""where to start"" but in the end it really doesn't matter. You'll be impressed no matter what order you see everything in.4. There are buttons on the railing throughout the exhibits, which activate various details in the scene. Press ALL the buttons! (But really, some of them are quite delightful and you don't want to miss out.)5. Plan to stay for 2-3 hours...at least!If you find yourself in Hamburg you need to visit, for the child inside you. Miniatur Wunderland will bring out the wonder and excitement of the child you used to be."
0,"This place is a nightmare! Went with a group of six and from start to finish, everything was inexcusable. The seating was tight, the service was rude and unattentive, the place is loud in a bad way, and the food is blah. People overrate the meat here by so much. It's OK, but folks, I could do much better with my own barbecue at home. I've had much better Rodizio in much cheaper restaurants elsewhere. Drinks came wrong, stuff that was mixed such as an Alsterwasser was watered down, and requests for condiments were simply ignored. When paying, everything took way too long (technical issues suppossedly) and no one seemed to care. Service is the absolute biggest disaster at this place. I've never actually had a waiter argue with me to the extent that these clowns were willing to go. When we started, we didn't want salad. We simply wanted to get right to the meat. This wasn't allowed as I guess we were suppossed to fill ourselves with starters to eat less meat. It was also clear that they avoided coming around too often with the meat skewers so as to hold back consumption. This place is a total joke and should be avoided."
1,the lunch pasta here has large portion.
4,"Really good oriental food. A really nice and cosy place too. Looks good from the outside as it does from the inside. The food is fresh and quick for a very reasonable price. It was crowded but not too loud. I went there with two friends. We all had different meals but everything arrived at the same time. The kumpir was perfectly cooked and the topping was delicious. My friend had a mixed starter plate which we shared but couldn't finish at all. The tea was perfect with the flavoures of our meals.Service was pretty friendly as well. Actually as I write this review, I am getting hungry and want to go there immediately I recommend this place for anyone who wants solid, good food and nice atmosphere before going out."
3,Price is a little steep at 9 euro but it does provide for a couple hours of an iinteresting audio guided tour of Hamburg history in your language.  Start on the middle floor and turn left after going up the first flight of stairs.   This will start you at the beginning of Hamburg and will then take you around up until around 1900.  The 20th century is on the lower floor and the period of world war 2 is somewhat hidden below that.  (That area in particular needs narration and better information on Hamburg's history during that time).
4,Amazing experience! Really good service and even better food. Felt like an evening in Thailand - definitely value for money!
1,"Just had the lunch buffett.  Not good.  All of the hot food in sauces have thick gelatinous skins, the tempura is soggy, the sushi stale.  Avoid this place, even the beer is bad.  How do you screw up beer in Germany?  We were the only two people in the place for an hour in the middle of lunchtime on a Saturday."
4,"We sat outside on the hilltop patio with gorgeous views of the water. They planted a line of trees along the edge, and they form a canopy of leaves above interwoven with a bamboo lattice (wonderful design). We ordered the raspberry lemonade (tasty), lamb and roast (everything was delicious and melted in our mouths). Wish we had time for dessert. Wonderful spot to enjoy lunch."
4,"Absolutely amazing. If you are in Hamburg for a few days, I would say this is a nice little visit. Theres a lot of detail to see and easily miss. I felt like one hour was good there but if you are in to this sort of thing, you could definitely stay longer. There were multiple levels and lots of interaction. I think its great for families."
3,"Don't come here in the winter! No, seriously, this is an outdoor beach bar! Hamburg beach clubs have a number of things in common: - slightly expensive drinks- mellow, never-ending dance music- lots of sun loungers- lots of sand On a warm sunny afternoon/evening Central Park is one of the best places to hang out in the Schanze"
0,"Do not bother, we waited upwards of 30 minutes between servers and the meat was just not that great.  Big disappointment both in food quality and service, especially at the price..."
4,"The original Mo Griller and the Currywurst is the bizzomb!!  I went here four times during my one week in Hamburg.  It would have been five but I missed them by 2 minutes on my last day, so sad, haha."
4,"Loved this place! Shabby chic all the way! What a cool concept, so comfy it's like sitting on your sofa at home but with the added benefit of table service! The baileys coffee was luuuuuuvly."
3,"The Turmbar looks quite harmless from the outside, but from the inside, a spiral staircase (minus the stairs!) will take you in circles what seems to be forever until you arrive at the bar at the top. The Turmbar is actually divided into two bars - a small one at the bottom and a larger at the top. I hadn't actually been to the top bar but spent an entire evening in the odd Inca-themed bar at the bottom, which reminded me of a bar I had visited in Disneyworld. Don't worry - even if you decide to party at the bar on the bottom floor, you'll end up having to go on up the spiral, since that's where the toilets are. Recommended for the adventurous and those who are looking for a light evening - you're probably NOT going to want to go up that spiral while plastered."
3,"This bar is in ok. Giving 4 stars for the reason I once reviewed this place as another bar :D So, I suppose, this place has no face. It is just an ok bar with sofas and cheap drinks. It is a great place to go in between, but I would never say smthn like: Oh, lets go to the Roosen today!:)"
3,This Russian Tango-class sub is well worth a visit. bear in mind that it can get very cold in there.
2,"It's a reasonable place to grab a quick lunch. They have a bunch of pre-made salads and snacks available for grab and go, but the main counter has warm food. The general idea is choose a meat/protein and then mix with a carb. I usually get chicken tandoori with white rice, but they have salmon also. Also pasta and pizza are available. There is a small pastry/bread selection too at the counter."
4,Really liked the eischnee mit grüntee! The dish takes time to prepare but it's an experience =D
3,"That's a weird beer. I like it but in Germany it's surprising to taste one that is so much different than most others. The weizenbier here is a little sour but it is pleasant, refreshing. Still, I don't know if I want it again or not. The haxe is tasty and fresh, although not that big portion as it first seems. A bit expensive but I guess for that part of Hamburg it's ok."
1,"This place has lost its ""new"" shine. The lines are a bit more tame at this point but it still gets pretty full. I am no longer as big a fan of the salads and burgers as initially thought. The amount of meat in their salads has significantly diminished, the quality of the salad itself is poor, the burgers less tasty and the interior a bit worn, yet this only slightly. Anyway, with the amount of time necessary to grab food here, the somewhat higher prices than the other burger places and the lack of ""newness"" I'm no longer impressed. It's just another chain and if I am actually going to eat burgers or meat, I want the best. I don't do so often and hence quality trumps quantity. Nevertheless, some friends still like this place so you'll have to make your own impression. I've simply passed my peak admiration for this place."
1,"Fast in, fast out: this place will quell all your primary late-night urges after all those beers:* fat* carbs* saltIt will indeed do this as competently as any cheap hot-dog place in Denmark .... and that's about it.Taste-wise, nothing to write home about, particularly the flavorless mayonnaise was a turn-off for me."
4,Very great cafe. Its such a nice crew there. It's the place to go. Food an drinks are cheap and great at the same time.
2,"this place deserves a lot of praise for the styles of the arts.the historical attributes of the arts are very impressive. in case you are it is your first time, it would nice to get in company with peoplehow know the place well. this will help you to explore a lot. the only thing that could make the place better is having staffs who really know what to look for with arts. in all this is a good place to spend time with visitors."
2,"I really like what I ordered, a vegetarian burrito without the tortilla (allergic to gluten). I was a little surprised that they didn't have one gluten free option on the menu and think that the price was a bit high for the amount of food I got."
4,"I great place to chill out in Niendorf. Whether you need to walk your dog, run, cycle or just sit on a bench this place is perfect. Lots of shaded paths make it nice and cool in summer. There's a playground for kids, barbeque areas and even a deer sanctuary. Waldcafe Corell is a really good place to stop off and get a snack too.I'm lucky enough to live 5 mins walk away from this place and I'm going to make sure I take advantage of it more in the future."
4,After sitting here a full sunday afternoon recovering from the night before this place really showed its merits. The music was perfect sunday chill music and the choise between strong and normal apple cider was a true blessing.
4,"Amazing maritime museum completed in 2008. Extremely comprehensive--  nine stories in all, with sub-floors in-between.  Largest collection of miniature ships ever assembled -- all by the die cast process.  Highlight for me:  Topographic map of the entire planet showing the islands throughout the Pacific -- even Catalina Island.  Topography of South American coastline shows how incredibly deep the drop-off is. The Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas jut out dramatically.  Other highlights:  all types of torpedoes and other naval weaponry.  Also:  WWII periscope -- in working order.  And a huge model of the QE II made out of legos.  I was happier than a pig in sh*t."
4,"Super great food, great atmosphere, friendly people, city center location. And really cheap prices for excellent food. My favorite place in Hamburg."
4,Great small and cozy place. Love the food and the service. Very nice couple. Details show they care.
4,Geile Location - super Essen! Ich habe noch nie so ein perfektes Rinderfilet mit Scampis (Surf & Turf) gegessen!    Extremst empfehlenswert!
4,I love the Miniatur Wunderland. It is a huge model train railway with several themes and countries. There a lot of details and it is impossible to see everything in one visit. Additionally there are buttons you can press to start a small action e.g. a fire and then all the firetrucks come to the building. Enjoy
4,Please go here to sample some excellent food and beer. A hidden gem in the centre of Hamburg.
4,"Fabulous!!! Friendly service, terrific food, beautiful setting. They made my husband, our toddler and I feel welcomed and appreciated. Plus the lamb! The wine! We can't wait to come back!"
4,"The food and service were really good! We had a little problem with the extra BBQ sauce on spare ribs, they apologised and brought a new one (even we finished most of the plate)! Really nice attitude!"
2,"Stopped here after dinner a couple of time, completely full on Fridays and Saturdays. loud music and place for smokers. it is a nice place to hang out in this neighborhood in summer with outdoor seating."
3,"We decided to give this place a try. It was located almost right in front of our hotel. There were only ten dishes on their menu, which was a good sign.We were there rather late. There were no customers, so we were served right away by the waiter. He offered us ""today's special"" which was crispy duck in sweet and sour sauce (predictable) and chicken in yellow curry sauce.The chicken dish was delicious, simply because the type of the yellow curry they use was not like the Thai yellow curry.It was more like the Indonesian's yellow curry, pretty light, tasted almost like the dish called ""Gulai nangka."" I was quite surprised of how similar the taste was. The choices of the vegetarian that they used for the dish was perfect. Carrot, zucchini, eggplants, baby corn, and yardlong bean, oh... and slices of chilies (d(-_^)good!!)I wasn't wild about the other dish, but I have already guessed it, since I usually don't like both the taste and consistency, of sweet and sour sauce. While we were waiting for our orders, the waiter told us a rather sad history.It was about, how hard was the reality 20 years ago, when he first migrated to German.He sailed with a big ship, together with thousand other illegal immigrants, from Vietnam. Many did not survive the long journey."
4,Nice spot on the Alster! Was here to enjoy the sun and this location is fantastic... It is without service but associates are friendly and they as well offer food (BBQ) when the weather is good. The prices are fair and you can rent boats etc if you are up for it.
3,"Nice little French bistro. Cozy and warm on the inside with outdoor seating available on a warm day. Their menu mainly consists of galettes (French savory crêpes), quiches, cheese, some wines and beers. I can't recall the rest but it is mainly French.I had the galette au jambon et fromage; cheese and ham galette. It was very good, the best part being the crunchy well done texture of the crepe. The ham and cheese was good too on there which washed down well with the Reisling that I had. Galette cost 6,90 which is really good especially for the area it is in. I strayed from my standard galette choice of la complète but I'll definitely be coming back to see theirs is like."
4,"My new favourite café and a highlight of my Hamburg visit.  Quaint and full of character,  good vibes and chill tunes - this café serves up some amazing homemade cheesecake (highly recommend!). The homemade ice-cream is also bomb! Staff are friendly and informative."
2,"I've eaten at vegetarian restaurants a lot and have plenty of experience with them. I was actually on my way to somewhere else that had a good yelp review, when I saw Loving Hut and decided to stop here instead.Figuring out a vegan Vietnamese menu that is written in German when you only speak English is a bit of a challenge. Lots of words like ""tofu"", ""reis"" and ""soja"" were obvious enough. I felt pretty comfortable ordering with my limited understanding of the menu. I got number 29, which was spicy vegetables and tofu (aren't they all? I don't know). It was good. The proprietor spoke enough English to make it work.Prices are reasonable, but its cash only. They do not serve any alcohol at all. Service is pretty slow because there aren't too many people working the (just 2?). Still, I didn't find the wait bad. Just a little noticeable. If I had a bottle of white wine, I might not have noticed the wait at all. Hint hint.The joy of finding a place that serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan foods is diminished somewhat because the food is just so-so. It's not brilliant, but its not at all bad. I thought my order was a little light on tofu. Just 5 or 6 pieces. I asked fir it spicy, though, and i got what i asked for. The appetiser we ordered was something akin to vegetarian breaded fried prawns. They weren't much to speak of."
1,"It is sushi and Asian fusion in Germany.  Do I need to say much more?  One of my Hamburg colleagues planned an outing for us here for dinner.  It's clubby atmosphere with the loud music, red and mod decor will get you in the mood for a raging good time.  However, I was jetlagged with well over 24 hours of no sleep.  The menu blended sushi, other Japanese dishes and Thai food.  I didn't want to seem like the pooper, so I let the group go with what they wanted.  Also, I am very skeptical of Asian restaurants abroad.  So we shared one of the sushi boat assortments and an assortment of skewers.  Rolls and skewers were average, lots covered in sauce.  I'm alway skeptical when rolls and everything are drenched in sauce.  The fried tuna one was a little on the fishy side.  Our waiter was trying to offer some recommendations but I felt that he wasn't too helpful to help indecisive first timers.  We ended up paying about 27 Euro each to share the two appetizers platter and our respective drinks.I'd say hunt around for better Asian food elsewhere."
4,Slowly becoming my Stammcafe in Eimsbüttel- the thing I like most about Zeitraum is that its not too full or loud- on the weekends the cafe will fill up but you can still grab a table and concentrate on whatever book or newspaper you are reading. There are a lot of magazines and newspapers up near the front and on the way out you can grab a DVD two doors down from Filmraum (they must be run by the same folks). Drinks are good (very nice green tea and rooibos combinations) and prices are fair- I have not tried the food or the brunch yet but it looks like your standard Hamburg cafe menu and is mostly (if not all) organic so plus one there. This place would be really cool to rent out for a birthday party- I might just have to do that
4,"Oh my good - Jenfeld. This Part of Hamburg is not really known as a top place to go. But ""top"" often means a typical place for hipsters and or tourists. So - follow the stars of yelp and get surprised.To me Hoang Mai is one the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Hamburg. Uuuugh, its ugly here. First problem - the door is closed. In general you enter the restaurant via the shop beside. Hey if you solved this problem, the spartan interior and green walls may make you think ""am I right here"". YES YOU ARE!!!The waitress suddenly turned up, presented the menu. Asked If we are in first time. Explained all options of the menu (in really perfect German). Some of the food is vegetarian, but can be ordered with broth. In this case, broth is made of bones - no longer vegetarian at all. Good to now but anyway - bone broth, sounds really good!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because most of the people here are Asians. One more point to assume the food is authentic!YOU ARE RIGHT HERE!!!Because the taste is mmmmmmmm really incredible. Portions are OK. Referring to the amount and quality, the price is ok, not cheap but neither expensive. So follow the stars - 'cause Yelp will help you to find the hidden stars!"
4,I'm so sad we didn't take a picture but all the food we ordered were all really good. Friendly staff and delicious food. I will definitely go back next time.
3,"This place is pretty good. I have my favorites in Hamburg when it comes to Currywurst but you can't go wrong with these guys, be it left or right side of the road or their newer location on the Jungfernstieg. The people are pretty nice and I haven't yet ever received a bad Wurst. It tends to be fairly packed which somehow adds to the charm. It wouldn't be the same if no one else was there. It is tough at times though to find even the narrowest of space to put down your plate to stand there and eat."
4,"I came here for lunch around midday and there was plenty of space to sit as a group. Ordering through the tablets built into the table was novel but not perfect; I wanted the chili burger without cheese but the software didn't give me the option to take the cheese off. No big deal, I went with the Burgerlich burger instead. It was pretty good, although the brioche bun was a little sweet for me. I got a side of fries as well, which came with an excellent BBQ sauce (word of warning: the menu calls it 'Bullseye Sauce'. No idea why; maybe because it hits the spot?). The whole meal cost just under €8 and they gave out free apples on the way out, which was a nice touch.Good lunch spot and burger joint. I'll be back.Side note: if you're from the UK, this place is very similar to Byron."
4,SO FUN. Learned a lot! Would definitely do it again.
3,"This is very personal restaurant with high ambitions and with good natural wines, which is a bit hard to find in Hamburg.Absolutely worth a visit!Great staff!"
4,"Hmm, just another cool place to hang out with mates. typical algerian background makes it a cool palce to know how algeria tradition is. the kitchen always has several good aroma. the funny thing when you order different food with friends is that each person want to have a taste of what other mate is eating. this is all down to the good stuff from the small kitchen.after enjoying the cocos with merguerz,i just could not take any star from the ratings."
3,"Wow.....what an experiance.Crazy place, excellent service (lot of passion) and great food.Reservation recommendet. It was full the whole evening.High noise level.Pizza is the main dish and 90% of all orders.Excellent. However by far not the best in town.Burrata was delicious. Perfect!Clear a place to be if you are close to the harbour."
4,"main place to get food for me. it's cheap, it's tasty and it's fast  what the hell more would you need?"
4,"One of my favourite Döner places in town. Specifically, I find the service to be super nice. This seems to be family run or at least the folks there have been working together for a while. The food has always impressed us and we personally like the taste. We actually come a bit out of our way to eat here as we don't live in the area. When we are up for a Döner Teller, my wife and I jump in the car to come get one here. They have the standard selection like every other Döner Imbiss but the folks are always nice and there is plenty of traffic in here so that nothing in the store has time to go bad. Further, they make their bread fresh in the store and it's usually still warm from the oven and super tasty. I'm sure everyone has their favourite place when it comes to Döners but this one is ours because of the people. If in the area, stop in and try it out. They have outdoor seating as well for the warmer weather months."
3,"YES, get a Hamburger in Hamburg!!Fun place, good vibe, youthful crowd. St.Pauli area of Hamburg. English widen spoken. Good music from the 70's & 80's.  HUGE 1/2 lb thick burgers, order them MEDIUM RARE 4 juicy. Tiny ""Hamburger Buns?""( more similar to English muffins....DUDE?! WTF? Soggy fries :-((( even begging first to make them well cooked, they haven't a clue how to cook FF!"
4,Nice restaurant!!! The food is delicious and cheap.
2,"There certainly is a new wave of ice cream in Germany ... but I wondered why people keep lining up at Eisliebe? Is it that it's 20-30 cents cheaper than at Schmidt's up the road?Eisliebe's few flavours from Amarena to Vanilla are as vanilla as they come, and so is the quality. I actually threw away some of it, it was so bland."
3,This Jim Block restaurant is located close to Gänsemarkt. It is nicely decorated and clean. The staff was very nice and the food was good. It is a great fast food alternative.The entrance is even with the ground.
3,"Arguably the most centrally located restaurant in the Hamburg, being situated in the vaulted basement of the City Hall (and just around the corner from Rathousmarkt station).Good selection of food, good service, reasonable prices.  And - always useful for the traveller - English menus if needed.In summer months they also open a Terrace in the City Hall courtyard."
4,"Amazing Italian food.  If you go, you must try the fresh tagliatelle mixed in a Parmesan wheel with white truffles.  Absolutely divine!Make reservations and go early...as they run out of dishes (especially fish dishes) around 8-9PM.Honestly, you have to love a restaurant that buys their main ingredients fresh every morning and sells out at some point in the night.   You know you are getting the best possible ingredients you can get.You must try at least once!"
4,"Olympisches Feuer doesn't look like much from the outside. The sign looks like a pretty bad relic from the 80s and the menu - superficially - looks even worse. However, don't judge a book by it's cover Olympisches Feuer does some of the best food in the Schanze and does it at a great price. I recommend the Gyros mit Metaxasousse. Yum. On Saturday afternoons they normally do the lunch menu until 3pm, and then you can stay and watch the German football on the flatscreens!"
3,"If you have ever been to a Sausalitos Bar before this one will not really be any different, excpet it is much bigger than any other I have been to before. It has a huge first floor and a smaller second floor. The cocktails happy hour is every day. You get a Jumbe cocktail for the price of a regular. The food is great especially if you are a mexican food lover. It is located in the Chille house which is in the back of the Moenkenbergstrasse. Every thursday they organize afterwork parties very very nice.cheers"
4,"I ended up here by accident one Sunday afternoon when a heavy thunderstorm turned the Hafencity into an extension of the Elbe river. The place was tightly packed with people looking for refuge from the storm. I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and the low prices for coffee drinks (about a Euro less than Starbucks and Balzac for a large latte). They also offers salads and noodle dishes in addition to great sandwiches. Summary: Lovely chain coffee shop that offers more food choices and cheaper and better coffee than Starbucks and Balzac. Interior is stylish and staff is very friendly. My favorite coffee place now, other locations are nice as well."
3,"This is a Korean restaurant. Why there also happens to be sushi on the menu too is completely baffling. This is pretty obvious from how much more Korean food is on the menu than sushiI chose to go with a classic. It's hard to ever go wrong with bibimbap. Good food portion, really good sauce and an authentic bibimbap. I was pleased. I shall return to try the rest of the menu, mostly likely their bulgogi"
2,"pretty good food, decent service.we had a pizza - good, lasagna - not good, a few salads - good, and a pasta special of the day with chanterelle mushrooms - amazing.we were greeted warmly at the door by, seemingly, the owner.we did experience long wait times after that though, but maybe that's just the culture ?"
4,"Hamburg has 3-4 very good steakhouses. Meatery is easily the best. The quality of the meat is amazing, the tartars too and most of the other dishes I've tried. The side dishes are perfectly executed as well (the reblochon potato gratin, the very light onion rings and the mushrooms are to die for ). But the meat is definitely the star, cooked to perfection at the desired level of doneness."
4,"one of the best icecream you can get in Hamburg. very tasteful, Not to sweet, not full of cream as in most stores. no fancy shit just pure taste."
3,My first time in a vegan restaurant and I gotta say it was really delicious. As a vegetarian it was also nice to be able to just look at the menu and know that I can order anything I want without having to think about it because it's all-vegan! The restaurant is also really pretty and the people were very nice.
4,"This American and all my American friends absolutely love Qrito. It is so fresh and delicious I could eat there everyday. Some of my friends actually do! It is the closest thing to the USA's Chipotle or Qdoba. It was a blessing to experience this place on the recommendation of a friend and not only do they have comforting mexican food, they have American candies and American sized soda cans in flavors you can't get anywhere else. Lunchtime is typically packed with students, but you'll get a seat with a little bit of patience. The people that work there are always friendly and even bring your order to you once it is ready. Word has spread about how great and fresh the food is and I would recommend this place to anyone. The prices are not bad at all and they are always efficient with their service. Various meat choices as well as hot sauces."
4,"Amazing coffee and extremely friendly baristas. Pour over coffees are superb and the cafe has amazing views of the canal. What is not to love about this place? On my second visit, I got wild and tried the food. No surprise, it was also incredible! I had the poached egg with spinach and avocado served on a huge loaf of fresh bread, all topped with coriander-basil pesto. Be still my heart! If you are close - come here, if not still come here."
